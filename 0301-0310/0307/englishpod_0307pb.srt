00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,419
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,179
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,660
My name is Kathryn, and today we're talking about a very, very important part of conversations in English.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,460
That's right.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,779
Today we are introducing a new series all about small talk.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:16,640
Okay.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,460
What is small talk, Marco?

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:28,920
Well, small talk is just everyday conversation about maybe the weather, about how you are, what's new in your life, etc.

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,519
It's just plain conversation.

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,859
So something very simple and usually pretty quick.

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,280
It's what you say to people when you bump into them or when you see them at a party.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,020
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out just what kind of small talk we have.

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,020
Hey, Michelle, this is my friend James.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,960
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,659
Oh, hi, James.

16
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,759
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,780
So, um, are you visiting for business or pleasure?

18
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,880
Well, actually a little of both.

19
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,099
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

20
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,040
Oh, that's cool.

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,900
How's it going?

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,920
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,420
It's really an amazing city.

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,540
It sure is.

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,879
Are you staying for long?

26
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,659
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,879
I wish I could stay longer, but...

28
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:25,840
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,040
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week.

30
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,640
So if you want to drop by then.

31
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,680
That sounds great.

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,359
I'd love to.

33
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,799
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,079
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,939
So now let's take a look at a lot of great phrases that we've picked out for you this time on Fluency Builder.

36
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,599
Fluency Builder.

37
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:53,519
All right, so I've got two Fluency Builders today, so we're going to be exploring a lot of different phrases.

38
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,959
We've got three now.

39
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,340
The first one is very, very common.

40
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,040
You hear this phrase, nice to meet you.

41
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:08,240
Right, so obviously if you meet someone new, you're introduced by your friend or something, you can just say, hi, nice to meet you.

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,340
All right, so nice to meet you, nice to meet you too.

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,780
That's what we say afterwards because it sounds very funny if you say it two times.

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,360
Right.

45
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,479
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,039
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Right, exactly.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,840
So she went on this girl, Michelle, to ask if he is visiting Shanghai for business or pleasure.

49
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,939
All right, this is an important difference, something that we often talk about in small talk.

50
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,960
You can travel for business.

51
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,659
That means business trips where you can travel to see different sites and have fun.

52
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:45,560
That's called pleasure, and so we often hear this phrase, business or pleasure.

53
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,639
Right, so if someone comes to your country, you say, oh, so are you here for business or pleasure?

54
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,400
Oh, I'm here on business, or I'm here to see the sights.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,840
Okay, very good.

56
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,080
And so James is actually in Shanghai doing both things.

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:09,460
He's on a business trip, but he's also taking Mandarin classes, and so Michelle went on to say, that's great, how's it going?

58
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,340
All right, you're going to hear this all the time in English.

59
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,879
We say how's it going to our friends and family.

60
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:25,680
I wouldn't say it in a formal occasion with my boss or with my teacher, but it's very casual, very informal, and it's a way to ask how things are.

61
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,039
So you're taking classes, how's it going?

62
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,280
Exactly.

63
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,759
So this basically means how are the classes going?

64
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,020
How is everything?

65
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,400
Right, or you could say, oh, Marco, I haven't seen you in a while.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,460
How is it going?

67
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:43,240
And that's another way of saying hi to someone or saying, how are you?

68
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,039
How are you?

69
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,860
How have you been recently?

70
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,900
So there are two differences in that phrase there.

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,719
In this case, Michelle is asking how the Mandarin classes are going.

72
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,500
How is it?

73
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,539
Is it good?

74
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,020
Is it bad?

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,659
Is it difficult?

76
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,300
Is it easy?

77
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,300
Et cetera.

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,659
But if you say to someone, hi, I haven't seen you for such a long time, how's it going?

79
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,819
That's more of a how are you type thing.

80
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,580
That's like how's your life going.

81
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:05,979
Exactly.

82
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,620
So just think about what you're talking about.

83
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,819
Are you talking about general situations, like a person's life?

84
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:16,699
Or are you talking about maybe lessons or class or a job?

85
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,480
That's right.

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,519
Okay, so we're going to take a break here.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,079
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

88
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,560
And we'll be back in a little bit with more phrases.

89
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,740
Hey, Michelle, this is my friend, James.

90
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,680
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

91
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,379
Oh, hi, James.

92
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,459
Nice to meet you.

93
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:41,519
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

94
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,600
Well, actually a little of both.

95
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:46,819
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,759
Oh, that's cool.

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,620
How's it going?

98
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,639
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough, actually.

99
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,639
But I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

100
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,120
It's really an amazing city.

101
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,259
It sure is.

102
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,600
Are you staying for long?

103
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,339
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

104
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,579
I wish I could stay longer, but...

105
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:05,540
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

106
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,600
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week, so if you want to drop by then...

107
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,399
That sounds great.

108
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,060
I'd love to.

109
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,500
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

110
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,860
All right, we're back.

111
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,500
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder part two.

112
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,800
So Michelle at the end of today's dialogue says if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

113
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,480
All right, so to show someone the sights.

114
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,920
We talked about this a little bit earlier with that word pleasure.

115
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,199
What does it mean to show someone the sights, Marco?

116
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,279
So basically the sights, we're talking about the different attractions of a city or place.

117
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,680
So the museums, maybe different buildings or different attractions in general.

118
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,199
What is there to sight see?

119
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,240
Okay, so we are in Paris, Marco, and I say, hey, I'd love to show you the sights.

120
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,639
What do you expect to see?

121
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,939
So maybe we would go to the Eiffel Tower.

122
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,259
Maybe we would go to...

123
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,019
Notre Dame Cathedral.

124
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,740
Exactly.

125
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:09,860
So we would go see all these different sights and to show, and that would mean that you are showing me the sights.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,519
You are taking me to see all these sights.

127
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:11,879
Okay.

128
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,439
Okay.

129
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,100
And she is also having a little get together at her apartment, at her new apartment.

130
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,980
So what is a little get together?

131
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:21,019
This is a noun.

132
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,759
This is a get together.

133
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:23,879
So think about this.

134
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,779
Two different words, actually.

135
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:25,759
Get together.

136
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,899
But it's a noun.

137
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,399
It's a thing.

138
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,180
It's like a party, but it's a small party, right?

139
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,660
A little get together.

140
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:41,399
So I like to think of a get together as something very casual, something very small, sometimes intimate where you just have three or four or five friends.

141
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,759
And it's not as big as a party where everyone is dancing.

142
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:46,699
Okay.

143
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,980
So a little get together is just a small group of people.

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
You invite them over to your house, very relaxed, very casual.

145
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,500
It's not really a party.

146
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,600
It's more of a reunion of friends.

147
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,000
And like we said, it's a noun.

148
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,980
So you say, I'm having a get together.

149
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:01,079
Okay.

150
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,699
And she actually asks him to come, but she says it in a different way.

151
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,439
She says, if you want to drop by.

152
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:10,379
Okay.

153
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:18,060
This is something people often say in small talk because you don't want to say, you should come stay for a while because that's, I don't know.

154
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:18,980
They just met.

155
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:19,500
It's not in order.

156
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:20,040
Yeah.

157
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,740
So you should drop by means you should come and see and decide if you want to stay.

158
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:34,740
So basically it's also kind of a relaxed way of saying you can come whenever you want during our party or our get together.

159
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,439
So if the get together is 9 PM to midnight, you can drop by whenever, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,399
So to drop by is to come for a short period.

161
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:52,259
So if we're talking on the phone and I say, I'll drop by your house later on today, that means I'm going to go to your house very quickly at an unexpected time.

162
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:52,740
Yeah.

163
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,060
Or you could use it in a question.

164
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,540
You know, Marco, I really wanted to borrow that DVD.

165
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,600
When can I drop by to pick it up?

166
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,139
Okay.

167
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,220
Very, very good.

168
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,459
Now let's take a look at our last phrase.

169
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,620
Michelle and James decided that they want to keep in touch.

170
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,600
And so he said, let me take down your number.

171
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,600
Okay.

172
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,920
So we're not talking about taking it anywhere, taking a number anywhere and going somewhere.

173
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:17,800
We're talking about writing something down.

174
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,160
So in this case, your number is your phone number.

175
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:20,779
Okay.

176
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,079
Let me take down your number means let me write down your telephone number.

177
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:25,819
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,300
Okay.

179
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,740
So it's another way of saying, let me write down your telephone number, take down my phone number, call me later.

180
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,159
That's right.

181
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,399
So can, can I take down your number so I can call you later?

182
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,179
Okay.

183
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:37,940
That's another way of asking this question.

184
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:38,600
Very good.

185
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,240
All right.

186
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,919
So that concludes Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

188
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,259
Hey Michelle, this is my friend James.

189
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

190
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:55,799
Oh, hi James.

191
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,000
Nice to meet you.

192
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,039
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

193
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,139
Well, actually a little of both.

194
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,340
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

195
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,299
Oh, that's cool.

196
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,159
How's it going?

197
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,179
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

198
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,700
It's really an amazing city.

199
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:16,779
It sure is.

200
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,159
Are you staying for long?

201
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,860
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

202
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,240
I wish I could stay longer, but...

203
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,080
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sites, then just call me.

204
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,299
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week.

205
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,159
So if you want to drop by then...

206
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,940
That sounds great.

207
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:32,600
I'd love to.

208
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,100
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

209
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,879
Okay.

210
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,279
So this is part one of our small talk series.

211
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:52,019
We're going to have 10 episodes, and in each episode we're going to be faced with a little different situation or circumstance where we will be forced to have a very quick chat with someone.

212
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:52,659
That's right.

213
00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:00,559
And so you're often going to find yourself in these situations if you're traveling to an English speaking country or you're living or working in America, for example.

214
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,919
And so it's really important because I think oftentimes you don't learn this in class.

215
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,039
This is something that you have to really learn when you're in the country or learn with us here at EnglishPod.

216
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,480
That's right.

217
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,080
It's a little bit of social skills for these awkward or maybe new situations.

218
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,399
All right.

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,120
So if you guys have any other questions or doubts, you can find us at EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

220
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,919
Bye, guys.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,120
Bye.
