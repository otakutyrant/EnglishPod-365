00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we're talking about a very, very important part of conversations in English.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we are introducing a new series all about small talk.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is small talk, Marco?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, small talk is just everyday conversation about maybe the weather, about how you are, what's new in your life, etc.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's just plain conversation.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So something very simple and usually pretty quick.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's what you say to people when you bump into them or when you see them at a party.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out just what kind of small talk we have.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey, Michelle, this is my friend James.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, hi, James.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So, um, are you visiting for business or pleasure?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, actually a little of both.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, that's cool.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How's it going?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's really an amazing city.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It sure is.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are you staying for long?

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I wish I could stay longer, but...

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So if you want to drop by then.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That sounds great.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'd love to.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So now let's take a look at a lot of great phrases that we've picked out for you this time on Fluency Builder.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Fluency Builder.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right, so I've got two Fluency Builders today, so we're going to be exploring a lot of different phrases.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We've got three now.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The first one is very, very common.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You hear this phrase, nice to meet you.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right, so obviously if you meet someone new, you're introduced by your friend or something, you can just say, hi, nice to meet you.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, so nice to meet you, nice to meet you too.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's what we say afterwards because it sounds very funny if you say it two times.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Right, exactly.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So she went on this girl, Michelle, to ask if he is visiting Shanghai for business or pleasure.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All right, this is an important difference, something that we often talk about in small talk.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can travel for business.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That means business trips where you can travel to see different sites and have fun.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's called pleasure, and so we often hear this phrase, business or pleasure.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Right, so if someone comes to your country, you say, oh, so are you here for business or pleasure?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh, I'm here on business, or I'm here to see the sights.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, very good.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And so James is actually in Shanghai doing both things.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's on a business trip, but he's also taking Mandarin classes, and so Michelle went on to say, that's great, how's it going?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
All right, you're going to hear this all the time in English.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We say how's it going to our friends and family.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I wouldn't say it in a formal occasion with my boss or with my teacher, but it's very casual, very informal, and it's a way to ask how things are.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So you're taking classes, how's it going?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Exactly.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So this basically means how are the classes going?

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How is everything?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right, or you could say, oh, Marco, I haven't seen you in a while.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How is it going?

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And that's another way of saying hi to someone or saying, how are you?

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How are you?

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How have you been recently?

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So there are two differences in that phrase there.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In this case, Michelle is asking how the Mandarin classes are going.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How is it?

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is it good?

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is it bad?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is it difficult?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is it easy?

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Et cetera.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But if you say to someone, hi, I haven't seen you for such a long time, how's it going?

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's more of a how are you type thing.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's like how's your life going.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Exactly.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So just think about what you're talking about.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you talking about general situations, like a person's life?

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or are you talking about maybe lessons or class or a job?

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's right.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, so we're going to take a break here.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And we'll be back in a little bit with more phrases.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey, Michelle, this is my friend, James.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, hi, James.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Nice to meet you.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Well, actually a little of both.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, that's cool.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
How's it going?

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough, actually.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's really an amazing city.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It sure is.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you staying for long?

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I wish I could stay longer, but...

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week, so if you want to drop by then...

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That sounds great.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'd love to.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
All right, we're back.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder part two.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So Michelle at the end of today's dialogue says if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All right, so to show someone the sights.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We talked about this a little bit earlier with that word pleasure.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What does it mean to show someone the sights, Marco?

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So basically the sights, we're talking about the different attractions of a city or place.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So the museums, maybe different buildings or different attractions in general.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What is there to sight see?

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, so we are in Paris, Marco, and I say, hey, I'd love to show you the sights.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you expect to see?

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So maybe we would go to the Eiffel Tower.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Maybe we would go to...

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Notre Dame Cathedral.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Exactly.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So we would go see all these different sights and to show, and that would mean that you are showing me the sights.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are taking me to see all these sights.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And she is also having a little get together at her apartment, at her new apartment.

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So what is a little get together?

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is a noun.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is a get together.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So think about this.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Two different words, actually.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Get together.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But it's a noun.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a thing.

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's like a party, but it's a small party, right?

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A little get together.

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I like to think of a get together as something very casual, something very small, sometimes intimate where you just have three or four or five friends.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And it's not as big as a party where everyone is dancing.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So a little get together is just a small group of people.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You invite them over to your house, very relaxed, very casual.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's not really a party.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's more of a reunion of friends.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And like we said, it's a noun.

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So you say, I'm having a get together.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And she actually asks him to come, but she says it in a different way.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
She says, if you want to drop by.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is something people often say in small talk because you don't want to say, you should come stay for a while because that's, I don't know.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They just met.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not in order.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So you should drop by means you should come and see and decide if you want to stay.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So basically it's also kind of a relaxed way of saying you can come whenever you want during our party or our get together.

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So if the get together is 9 PM to midnight, you can drop by whenever, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So to drop by is to come for a short period.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So if we're talking on the phone and I say, I'll drop by your house later on today, that means I'm going to go to your house very quickly at an unexpected time.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Or you could use it in a question.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You know, Marco, I really wanted to borrow that DVD.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When can I drop by to pick it up?

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Very, very good.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now let's take a look at our last phrase.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Michelle and James decided that they want to keep in touch.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And so he said, let me take down your number.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So we're not talking about taking it anywhere, taking a number anywhere and going somewhere.

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We're talking about writing something down.

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So in this case, your number is your phone number.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let me take down your number means let me write down your telephone number.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Uh-huh.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So it's another way of saying, let me write down your telephone number, take down my phone number, call me later.

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So can, can I take down your number so I can call you later?

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's another way of asking this question.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Very good.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So that concludes Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Hey Michelle, this is my friend James.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, hi James.

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Nice to meet you.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So are you visiting for business or pleasure?

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, actually a little of both.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes too.

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, that's cool.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How's it going?

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's really an amazing city.

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It sure is.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you staying for long?

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I wish I could stay longer, but...

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sites, then just call me.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm having a little get together at my new apartment next week.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So if you want to drop by then...

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That sounds great.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'd love to.

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let me take down your number, Michelle.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So this is part one of our small talk series.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We're going to have 10 episodes, and in each episode we're going to be faced with a little different situation or circumstance where we will be forced to have a very quick chat with someone.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And so you're often going to find yourself in these situations if you're traveling to an English speaking country or you're living or working in America, for example.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And so it's really important because I think oftentimes you don't learn this in class.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is something that you have to really learn when you're in the country or learn with us here at EnglishPod.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a little bit of social skills for these awkward or maybe new situations.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So if you guys have any other questions or doubts, you can find us at EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Bye, guys.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Bye.
