EnglishPod.com Hey, Michelle.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is my friend, James.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, hi, James.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So, are you visiting for business or pleasure?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, actually a little of both.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes, too.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, that's cool.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How's it going?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough, actually.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's really an amazing city.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It sure is.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you staying for long?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I wish I could stay longer, but...

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm having a little get-together at my new apartment next week, so if you want to drop by then...

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That sounds great.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'd love to.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let me take down your number, Michelle.
