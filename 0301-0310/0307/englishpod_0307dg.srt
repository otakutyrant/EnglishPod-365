EnglishPod.com Hey, Michelle.

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,560
This is my friend, James.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,560
He's visiting Shanghai from New York.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,199
Oh, hi, James.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,339
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:18,359
So, are you visiting for business or pleasure?

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,440
Well, actually a little of both.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,640
I'm meeting some business contacts, but I'm also taking some Mandarin classes, too.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,620
Oh, that's cool.

10
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,480
How's it going?

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,480
Well, I'm finding the classes pretty tough, actually.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,480
But I'm having a great time in Shanghai.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
It's really an amazing city.

14
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,079
It sure is.

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,460
Are you staying for long?

16
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:36,159
Only two weeks, unfortunately.

17
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,500
I wish I could stay longer, but...

18
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,399
Well, listen, if you need someone to show you the sights, then just call me.

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm having a little get-together at my new apartment next week, so if you want to drop by then...

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,259
That sounds great.

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:48,920
I'd love to.

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,340
Let me take down your number, Michelle.
