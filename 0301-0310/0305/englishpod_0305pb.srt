00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,220
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:03,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,359
My name is Catherine and today we're going to be talking about a very fun game.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,220
That's right.

5
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:13,640
Today we're going bowling, a very popular sport amongst many people.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,600
And so we're going to take a look at how you play this sport and all the vocab related to this great game.

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,100
Alright, so let's take a listen to our dialogue and we'll be right back.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,000
Alright, so the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.

9
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:37,659
Why not?

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,479
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,880
If you step there you'll slip and fall.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,020
Okay, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our name's on the scorecard, so now how the heck do I play this?

13
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,719
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

14
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,939
If you do, that is called a strike.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,200
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

16
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:03,039
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,780
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,299
Got it.

19
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,519
Okay, I'm going to give it a go.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,459
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,739
I told you, it's harder than you think.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,299
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,959
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of that vocab on Language Takeaway.

24
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,620
Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,840
So the first word we have today in Language Takeaway is lane.

26
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:38,900
That's right, a bowling lane.

27
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:43,900
So a lane that is where you actually play this game.

28
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:48,420
That's right, a lane is also a word for like a road, a small narrow road.

29
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:55,079
So in bowling this is the flat surface, the floor that's long that you roll the ball down.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,920
That's right, okay so that's your lane.

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,180
So as you said, you roll the ball down the lane and you try to knock down the pins that are at the end of the lane.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:15,419
That's right, so pins are, they're a little bit heavy, they're usually white and they have, they're wide at the bottom and narrow at the top.

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,300
They almost look like wine bottles.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:17,979
Exactly.

35
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:24,080
And the goal of the game is to knock these down to make them fall on the ground.

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,759
That's right, okay so that's why you are using, that's why you are throwing the ball down the lane to knock down these pins.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,840
Now if you knock all of them down on your first try, that's called a strike.

38
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,599
A strike, that's right.

39
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,919
So that means all ten pins fall down on your first try.

40
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:54,759
But sometimes you don't get a strike, you maybe knock down eight pins and then later on your second try, because every person gets two tries, on your second try you knock down the last two pins.

41
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:55,879
Now what's that called, Marco?

42
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,879
So if you knock all of them down on your second try, that's called a spare.

43
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:11,979
Okay, strike, usually you write it with an X, that's on the scorecard, and a spare, which is two tries to get all ten pins, that's a slash.

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,780
That's right.

45
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:21,020
And if you don't get all of the pins in two tries, you still get points, so if you knock down eight pins you get eight, or if you knock down four pins you get four.

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:32,060
That's right, and you put your score on your scorecard, and now each player usually gets ten frames, or ten different opportunities to knock down all the pins.

47
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:46,300
Alright, so usually these are boxes on the scorecard, and you can play ten frame bowling, or also five frame, but it's important to remember that each frame gives you the opportunity to bowl two times.

48
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,719
Right.

49
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,780
Alright, so you get those two tries, so really it's twenty total tries to knock down these pins.

50
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:03,919
That's right, and now if you did really well, and on every opportunity of each frame you got a strike, that means that you would get a perfect score.

51
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,979
That's right, a perfect score, that means that you made no mistakes, you knocked down all the pins on the first try.

52
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:24,540
And now obviously down the lane, it's not as easy as it looks, because to the sides of your bowling lane you have this kind of a path that's to the bottom, so if your ball goes in there, you can't get it out.

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:32,680
That's right, so remember like I said earlier, a lane is also the name of a place where we can walk or drive, it's like a road.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,939
Well, we have gutters which are on the sides of these roads, and also in bowling, gutters.

55
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:46,740
They're lower, and normally on the streets they're for water, but in bowling they're the places on the right or the left side where your ball will fall.

56
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,879
And if your ball falls into the gutter, or it rolls into the gutter, you will hit no pins.

57
00:04:53,259 --> 00:05:00,360
Right, I think that's the main thing, if your ball goes in the gutter, you don't hit any pins at all, it just goes straight down and you don't hit anything.

58
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,839
That's right, so it's really sad when you bowl badly and you get a gutter ball, we call it.

59
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,660
That's right.

60
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,680
Alright, so let's take a look at all this vocab again, let's listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

61
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

62
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,699
If you do, that is called a strike.

63
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,920
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

64
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,759
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

65
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:57,500
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

66
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,019
Got it.

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,240
Okay, I'm going to give it a go.

68
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,180
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

69
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,480
I told you, it's harder than you think.

70
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,939
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

71
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,660
Alright, so we've picked out three different phrases for you, let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

72
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,100
Fluency Builder.

73
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:28,819
Alright, so the first phrase that we have today is something that you're going to hear a lot, although I want to remind everyone this is very informal.

74
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,819
So, we heard someone say in the dialogue, so now how the heck do I play this?

75
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,560
Okay, so how the heck do I turn this computer on?

76
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,920
Okay, so how do I turn this computer on means I don't know, please help me.

77
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,839
But how the heck means I really don't know, I really need your help.

78
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,040
That's right, I really don't understand what's going on, I need someone's help.

79
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,800
Like how the heck did this happen means I absolutely did not expect this to happen, I'm very surprised.

80
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,500
That's right, it's actually a not very polite phrase to use, but at the same time it's not terribly impolite.

81
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,199
It's in the middle.

82
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,720
But it's very informal.

83
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:16,259
Alright, so now the person understands how to bowl, how the game works, and he says okay, got it, I'm going, I'm gonna give it a go.

84
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,720
Okay, I'm gonna means I'm going to, and this is very informal.

85
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,959
Gonna is a way to say going to, I will.

86
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,699
But the phrase here is give it a go.

87
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
What does that mean, Marco?

88
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,019
Give it a go.

89
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,540
So if you're gonna give it a go, it means that you're going to try.

90
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:36,339
Okay, so I'm gonna try.

91
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:41,860
So we can say this, now that we know how to play the game, let's give it a go.

92
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,540
Let's try to play, because we've been talking about it but we haven't been doing it.

93
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,939
So to give it a go means to try to do something.

94
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:59,120
Exactly, and that's basically it if maybe you're watching a game on the street and you want to try maybe a card game, you say okay, I want to give it a go.

95
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,220
I want to give it a go.

96
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,000
Alright, and what about our last phrase?

97
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,579
Now the very last phrase is the last phrase of our dialogue.

98
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
The character says, now let a pro show you how it's done.

99
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:23,019
Alright, so how it's done, this let me show you how it's done, because this person is saying I'm a pro, let me show you how it's done, is a very interesting way of saying something in English.

100
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,860
What is the real meaning of this phrase?

101
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,279
He's basically saying now let me show you how to do it.

102
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,879
Okay, the correct way.

103
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,179
So basically he's saying you didn't do it very well, you didn't bowl very well, you're new.

104
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,120
Let me show you how professional people bowl.

105
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,840
Let me give you an example.

106
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:50,580
Maybe you and your friend are making a cake and you don't really know what you're doing, so your friend says move over, let me show you how it's done.

107
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,860
That means the proper way to do it, the correct way.

108
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,320
So Marco, you're not doing it right, let me show you how it's done.

109
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,919
Exactly, a very useful phrase and actually it can seem a little bit confusing because you're using the verb there done.

110
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:12,259
So it may seem a little bit weird, do, done, but don't worry about it just take it as a phrase, let me show you how to do it, let me show you how it's done.

111
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:12,879
That's right.

112
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,580
So that's all we've got for Fluency Builder today, let's take another listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a second.

113
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,519
Alright, so the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.

114
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,200
Why not?

115
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,399
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down, if you step there you'll slip and fall.

116
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,559
Okay, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our name's on the scorecard, so now how the heck do I play this?

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,259
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

118
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,460
If you do, that is called a strike.

119
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,700
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

120
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,559
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

121
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,299
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

122
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:02,820
Got it.

123
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,059
Okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

124
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,960
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

125
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,259
I told you, it's harder than you think.

126
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,779
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

127
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,559
Alright, we're back, so bowling is actually a very, kind of like a pastime in the United States.

128
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,620
You get together with friends and you just go bowling.

129
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:38,960
That's right, I do believe it's also considered a sport, so many people play professionally or semi-professionally, but for me it's always been a very social game, something you do with a group of friends, you go out, it's really fun.

130
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,700
Yeah, especially because when you go bowling, many people can play, right?

131
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:53,779
Obviously at the same time, but you take turns and so while you're waiting, people are talking and eating, so it is a very social activity.

132
00:10:54,139 --> 00:11:04,340
That's right, so maybe a group of people will rent a lane, remember we were talking earlier about a lane being that one kind of strip of wood where you bowl the ball.

133
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:14,179
Well, a group of friends can rent a lane or two lanes, and the four or the eight of you can play together, each person playing one frame at a time.

134
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:29,360
That's right, and now actually the other thing about it is it's very funny to see people trying to bowl or maybe with the heavy ball or maybe they pass the line that we said they shouldn't pass and they slip and fall, so I guess that's what also makes it a little bit fun to play.

135
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:42,419
Yes, it can be a little bit embarrassing if you're not, I'm not very good, so I'm a very embarrassing bowler, but it's also really fun because if you go and you just have a nice time and it's a very social game.

136
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:56,059
Well, it is, and actually we are really curious to know if you've ever been bowling, I know many people who've never been bowling and they find it very, very fun, so why don't you come to our website EnglishPod.com and leave your questions and comments there as well.

137
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,399
Yeah, we hope to see you there, until next time guys, bye.
