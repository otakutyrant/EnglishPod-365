00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine and today we're going to be talking about a very fun game.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we're going bowling, a very popular sport amongst many people.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And so we're going to take a look at how you play this sport and all the vocab related to this great game.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Alright, so let's take a listen to our dialogue and we'll be right back.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Alright, so the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Why not?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you step there you'll slip and fall.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our name's on the scorecard, so now how the heck do I play this?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you do, that is called a strike.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Got it.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay, I'm going to give it a go.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I told you, it's harder than you think.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of that vocab on Language Takeaway.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So the first word we have today in Language Takeaway is lane.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's right, a bowling lane.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So a lane that is where you actually play this game.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right, a lane is also a word for like a road, a small narrow road.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So in bowling this is the flat surface, the floor that's long that you roll the ball down.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right, okay so that's your lane.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So as you said, you roll the ball down the lane and you try to knock down the pins that are at the end of the lane.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right, so pins are, they're a little bit heavy, they're usually white and they have, they're wide at the bottom and narrow at the top.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They almost look like wine bottles.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Exactly.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And the goal of the game is to knock these down to make them fall on the ground.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right, okay so that's why you are using, that's why you are throwing the ball down the lane to knock down these pins.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now if you knock all of them down on your first try, that's called a strike.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A strike, that's right.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So that means all ten pins fall down on your first try.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But sometimes you don't get a strike, you maybe knock down eight pins and then later on your second try, because every person gets two tries, on your second try you knock down the last two pins.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now what's that called, Marco?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So if you knock all of them down on your second try, that's called a spare.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, strike, usually you write it with an X, that's on the scorecard, and a spare, which is two tries to get all ten pins, that's a slash.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And if you don't get all of the pins in two tries, you still get points, so if you knock down eight pins you get eight, or if you knock down four pins you get four.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right, and you put your score on your scorecard, and now each player usually gets ten frames, or ten different opportunities to knock down all the pins.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright, so usually these are boxes on the scorecard, and you can play ten frame bowling, or also five frame, but it's important to remember that each frame gives you the opportunity to bowl two times.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Alright, so you get those two tries, so really it's twenty total tries to knock down these pins.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right, and now if you did really well, and on every opportunity of each frame you got a strike, that means that you would get a perfect score.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right, a perfect score, that means that you made no mistakes, you knocked down all the pins on the first try.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And now obviously down the lane, it's not as easy as it looks, because to the sides of your bowling lane you have this kind of a path that's to the bottom, so if your ball goes in there, you can't get it out.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's right, so remember like I said earlier, a lane is also the name of a place where we can walk or drive, it's like a road.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, we have gutters which are on the sides of these roads, and also in bowling, gutters.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They're lower, and normally on the streets they're for water, but in bowling they're the places on the right or the left side where your ball will fall.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And if your ball falls into the gutter, or it rolls into the gutter, you will hit no pins.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right, I think that's the main thing, if your ball goes in the gutter, you don't hit any pins at all, it just goes straight down and you don't hit anything.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right, so it's really sad when you bowl badly and you get a gutter ball, we call it.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright, so let's take a look at all this vocab again, let's listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you do, that is called a strike.

63
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Got it.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay, I'm going to give it a go.

68
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I told you, it's harder than you think.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Alright, so we've picked out three different phrases for you, let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fluency Builder.

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Alright, so the first phrase that we have today is something that you're going to hear a lot, although I want to remind everyone this is very informal.

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, we heard someone say in the dialogue, so now how the heck do I play this?

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, so how the heck do I turn this computer on?

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, so how do I turn this computer on means I don't know, please help me.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But how the heck means I really don't know, I really need your help.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's right, I really don't understand what's going on, I need someone's help.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Like how the heck did this happen means I absolutely did not expect this to happen, I'm very surprised.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's right, it's actually a not very polite phrase to use, but at the same time it's not terribly impolite.

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's in the middle.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it's very informal.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Alright, so now the person understands how to bowl, how the game works, and he says okay, got it, I'm going, I'm gonna give it a go.

84
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, I'm gonna means I'm going to, and this is very informal.

85
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Gonna is a way to say going to, I will.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But the phrase here is give it a go.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What does that mean, Marco?

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Give it a go.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So if you're gonna give it a go, it means that you're going to try.

90
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, so I'm gonna try.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So we can say this, now that we know how to play the game, let's give it a go.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's try to play, because we've been talking about it but we haven't been doing it.

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So to give it a go means to try to do something.

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Exactly, and that's basically it if maybe you're watching a game on the street and you want to try maybe a card game, you say okay, I want to give it a go.

95
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to give it a go.

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Alright, and what about our last phrase?

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now the very last phrase is the last phrase of our dialogue.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The character says, now let a pro show you how it's done.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Alright, so how it's done, this let me show you how it's done, because this person is saying I'm a pro, let me show you how it's done, is a very interesting way of saying something in English.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What is the real meaning of this phrase?

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's basically saying now let me show you how to do it.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, the correct way.

103
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So basically he's saying you didn't do it very well, you didn't bowl very well, you're new.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let me show you how professional people bowl.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let me give you an example.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Maybe you and your friend are making a cake and you don't really know what you're doing, so your friend says move over, let me show you how it's done.

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That means the proper way to do it, the correct way.

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So Marco, you're not doing it right, let me show you how it's done.

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Exactly, a very useful phrase and actually it can seem a little bit confusing because you're using the verb there done.

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So it may seem a little bit weird, do, done, but don't worry about it just take it as a phrase, let me show you how to do it, let me show you how it's done.

111
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So that's all we've got for Fluency Builder today, let's take another listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a second.

113
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Alright, so the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why not?

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down, if you step there you'll slip and fall.

116
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our name's on the scorecard, so now how the heck do I play this?

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If you do, that is called a strike.

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

120
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Got it.

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

125
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I told you, it's harder than you think.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Now let a pro show you how it's done.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Alright, we're back, so bowling is actually a very, kind of like a pastime in the United States.

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You get together with friends and you just go bowling.

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right, I do believe it's also considered a sport, so many people play professionally or semi-professionally, but for me it's always been a very social game, something you do with a group of friends, you go out, it's really fun.

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, especially because when you go bowling, many people can play, right?

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Obviously at the same time, but you take turns and so while you're waiting, people are talking and eating, so it is a very social activity.

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's right, so maybe a group of people will rent a lane, remember we were talking earlier about a lane being that one kind of strip of wood where you bowl the ball.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, a group of friends can rent a lane or two lanes, and the four or the eight of you can play together, each person playing one frame at a time.

134
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's right, and now actually the other thing about it is it's very funny to see people trying to bowl or maybe with the heavy ball or maybe they pass the line that we said they shouldn't pass and they slip and fall, so I guess that's what also makes it a little bit fun to play.

135
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, it can be a little bit embarrassing if you're not, I'm not very good, so I'm a very embarrassing bowler, but it's also really fun because if you go and you just have a nice time and it's a very social game.

136
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, it is, and actually we are really curious to know if you've ever been bowling, I know many people who've never been bowling and they find it very, very fun, so why don't you come to our website EnglishPod.com and leave your questions and comments there as well.

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, we hope to see you there, until next time guys, bye.
