EnglishPod.com Alright, so the first thing you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,339
Why not?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,140
Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,519
If you step there you'll slip and fall.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,719
Okay, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now how the heck do I play this?

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,420
You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock down all the pins.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,620
If you do, that is called a strike.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
If you don't knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare.

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,700
After 10 frames, we add up the points and see who has the most.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,420
300 is a perfect score, but very hard to get.

11
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:43,939
Got it.

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,200
Okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,100
Oh no, my ball went in the gutter.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,380
I told you, it's harder than you think.

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,920
Now let a pro show you how it's done.
