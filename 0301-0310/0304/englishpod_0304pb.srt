00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,580
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about someone who's very, very dirty.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,740
That's right.

5
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:15,759
And actually, not only are we talking about something being dirty, but also that we want to clean everything.

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,239
Okay, so you'll learn how to call someone who likes clean things in English today.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,039
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,899
This bathroom is a pigsty.

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,879
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,780
What's wrong?

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,340
I just can't stand it.

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,579
It's really gross in here.

13
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:39,960
There's a stain on the toilet seat, and the floor was wet and slippery, so I cleaned it.

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,200
You did what?

15
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,659
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,340
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

17
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,060
Are you out of your mind?

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,479
I can't help myself.

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,140
It's just so disgusting in here.

20
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,740
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,719
Just leave it to the cleaners, okay?

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,640
Hang on, I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

23
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:02,479
You're such a neat freak.

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm out of here.

25
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:12,459
Alright, we're back.

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,980
So this girl was very much of a neat freak, and we're going to take a look at that word a little bit later on.

27
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,260
Why don't we go back to the very beginning and take a look at some vocab on language takeaway.

28
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:25,819
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,299
The first word we have here on language takeaway today is pigsty.

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,359
Right, this bathroom is a pigsty.

31
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:39,680
Okay, so a pigsty is a place where pigs live.

32
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:48,799
Okay, so now this obviously, the bathroom is not really a place where pigs live, so if you call something a pigsty, you're saying that it's very...

33
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:48,920
Dirty.

34
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,560
You're saying it's disgusting.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,040
It's very, very dirty.

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,540
Like a pigsty.

37
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,560
So actually, if you go to a farm and you see where all the pigs are, that is actually called a pigsty.

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,060
Right, there's mud and dirt, and yeah, that's a pigsty.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,340
So someone who is very, very dirty you can also call a pig.

40
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,539
Okay, now she was saying that the bathroom is so dirty and it's really gross in here.

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, so gross means something is...

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,560
She doesn't like it, it's really dirty and, you know, makes her uncomfortable.

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,139
So something that doesn't taste good, you can say it's gross.

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,159
That's right.

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,659
So I don't like to eat snake.

46
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
I think eating snake is gross.

47
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,240
Okay, very good.

48
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:40,340
So something that is gross is something that's not really nice, maybe it tastes bad or it smells bad, something that is bad in general.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:40,900
That's right.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,639
Okay, so she went on to talk about the toilet seat and that there was a stain on the toilet seat.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,240
Okay, a stain is usually a bad thing.

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,379
It means that there's a color or a mark that's permanent or maybe can be washed away on something.

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,759
So in this case the toilet seat has a mark on it.

54
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,199
Okay.

55
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:09,819
Maybe it's brown or yellow, but I can also say I was drinking wine and I spilled the wine on my shirt and it left a stain.

56
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,259
Right.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,120
So now there's always this red part on my shirt, it won't go away.

58
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
Okay, so a stain is a mark that usually won't go away.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,300
Okay, so then she went on to describe the bathroom as being disgusting.

60
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,000
So I guess this is very similar to gross.

61
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:26,759
That's right.

62
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,599
Something that is gross is usually also disgusting.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
I can say, ugh, this food is awful.

64
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:34,039
It's just disgusting.

65
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:34,680
Okay.

66
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,599
But I can also say in this case, ugh, your room is disgusting.

67
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,699
You need to clean it.

68
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,639
It's so dirty or bad or unappealing.

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,120
So something that is gross, something that is disgusting is something negative.

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,659
Yes.

71
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:47,860
Yes.

72
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:48,580
Okay.

73
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,740
And then we have our keyword and the title of this lesson for today, a neat freak.

74
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,120
Her friend says, you're such a neat freak.

75
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,039
That's right.

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,259
So a neat freak is someone who likes things to be very clean, okay?

77
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:07,280
And so a neat freak does not live in a pigsty.

78
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:07,780
Right.

79
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,379
A neat freak does not like to be in pigsties.

80
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,979
A neat freak likes things to be in order and organized and clean.

81
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:23,279
So maybe somebody that's cleaning all the time or that's very, very organized, you can say that that person is a neat freak.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,980
He is a neat freak or she is a neat freak.

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,360
Now it's not necessarily a good thing to be a neat freak, but it's not terrible either to call somebody a neat freak.

84
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,480
You can say, hey, are you a neat freak?

85
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,259
Right.

86
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,160
That means, are you really concerned about cleanliness?

87
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:37,720
Uh-huh.

88
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,339
Okay.

89
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,100
Very good.

90
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,779
So a lot of great vocab.

91
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:43,620
Why don't we take a look again at our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

92
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,439
Ugh, this bathroom is a pigsty.

93
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,439
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

94
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,319
What's wrong?

95
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,899
I just can't stand it.

96
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,120
It's really gross in here.

97
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,500
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery.

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,699
So I cleaned it.

99
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,759
You did what?

100
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,199
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

101
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,879
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

102
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,639
Are you out of your mind?

103
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,019
I can't help myself.

104
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,740
It's just so disgusting in here.

105
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,279
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,259
Just leave it to the cleaners, okay?

107
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,959
Hang on.

108
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,180
I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

109
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,019
You're such a neat freak.

110
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm out of here.

111
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:33,939
All right, we're back.

112
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,699
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

113
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,939
Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,540
So the first thing we want to talk about today is this phrase, I can't stand it.

115
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,420
So this is our neat freak talking.

116
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,259
She says, I just can't stand it.

117
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,079
I just can't stand it.

118
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,000
So if you can't stand something, that means that you can't tolerate it.

119
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:55,860
That's right.

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,199
It means I don't like it.

121
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,519
I don't want it anymore.

122
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,040
I need to change it.

123
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:00,980
Okay.

124
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,860
So for example, if a bar is too loud, you say, I have to leave.

125
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,939
I can't stand it.

126
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
It's too loud in there.

127
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:09,839
That's right.

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,779
Or if you are next to me all day and you do tap, tap, tap, tap, tap with your pen, I say, Marco, stop it.

129
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,319
I can't stand it anymore.

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,040
Okay.

131
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:19,000
Very good.

132
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:25,800
And then she went on to explain or to justify why she was cleaning the public restroom.

133
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,879
And she said, I can't help myself.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,439
It's just too disgusting in here.

135
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,959
I can't help myself.

136
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,740
So this means that I cannot control my actions, okay?

137
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
I cannot control what I do.

138
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,920
And so in some cases, like with a neat freak, the person really needs everything to be clean.

139
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,540
And so she says, I can't help myself.

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,579
I have to clean.

141
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,199
Okay.

142
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,040
So it's a phrase like this.

143
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,379
Don't try to separate it.

144
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,300
Don't try to separate it and try to define what help and help yourself.

145
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,920
It's more of a phrase saying, I can't control myself.

146
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,579
I can't control my actions.

147
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,500
I can't help myself.

148
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,899
Or in the case of another person, you say, she can't help herself.

149
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,160
He can't help himself.

150
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:07,720
Right.

151
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,740
So maybe you'd like to smoke and you're smoking all the time and you say, stop smoking.

152
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,839
You say, I can't help myself.

153
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,600
I have to smoke.

154
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,459
Yeah, I have to smoke.

155
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:15,920
Okay.

156
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,019
And for our last phrase, she said, hang on, I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

157
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,839
Hang on.

158
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:26,519
This means wait, wait a moment.

159
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:26,839
Yeah.

160
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:27,300
Yeah.

161
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,620
So this is a really common phrase we hear in English.

162
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:39,319
It's something that you'll hear all the time in a pretty relaxed environment, not maybe in school, but if someone says, you know, okay, I'm going to go see you later.

163
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,339
And the other person wants to say something to you, you say, hang on, hang on, wait a moment.

164
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,720
I have to tell you this thing.

165
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,439
So you wouldn't really use it with your boss or a customer.

166
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,779
You wouldn't say, hang on a second.

167
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,920
No, you would say that with a friend or family member, things like that.

168
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:55,139
Okay.

169
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,300
So it's a very informal way of saying, wait a moment, wait a minute.

170
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,980
That's right.

171
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,540
So the formal way is please wait, please wait.

172
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,560
And the informal way is hang on, hang on, or hang on a sec, which is hang on a second.

173
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,579
All right.

174
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,779
That's all the words we have for today.

175
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,560
Why don't we review our dialogue one last time?

176
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,160
This bathroom is a pigsty.

177
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:24,100
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

178
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,000
What's wrong?

179
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,540
I just can't stand it.

180
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:27,779
It's really gross in here.

181
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,199
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery.

182
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,360
So I cleaned it.

183
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,419
You did what?

184
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,879
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

185
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,580
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

186
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,259
Are you out of your mind?

187
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,679
I can't help myself.

188
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,340
It's just so disgusting in here.

189
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,960
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

190
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:49,500
Just leave it to the cleaners.

191
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:49,940
Okay.

192
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,639
Hang on.

193
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,820
I'm just going to quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.

194
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,679
You're such a neat freak.

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,740
I'm out of here.

196
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:09,120
All right, so talking about cleanliness and being neat, what type of person are you?

197
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,259
Are you a neat freak?

198
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,460
Do you keep everything very clean and ordered?

199
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,080
I'm not a neat freak, but I'm also not a pig, not a slob.

200
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,259
I like things to be very organized, but I'm not really concerned about cleaning so much.

201
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,080
I'm too lazy.

202
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,740
There's a difference for me.

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,440
In my house, I know where everything is, but maybe there's clothes on the floor and there's books in the bathroom.

204
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm in the middle.

205
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,100
What about you?

206
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:37,980
Are you a neat freak?

207
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,840
No, I'm not really a neat freak per se, but I do like everything to be very clean on the other hand.

208
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,379
I can't really stand it when things are ...

209
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:53,340
If things are out of order a little bit, that's okay, but if things are dirty, that really gets to me.

210
00:09:53,340 --> 00:10:02,759
But I'm not the type of person that has folders with all my bills in one folder or labels or even when I was in school, I didn't have my notebooks in order.

211
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:03,179
Really?

212
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,659
So we're the opposite.

213
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,100
Yeah, exactly, but I hate things that are dirty.

214
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:09,120
Interesting.

215
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,879
Well, let us know, are you a neat freak?

216
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,759
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

217
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,659
You can talk about yourself all over that lesson comments area.

218
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:22,759
That's right, and if you have any other suggestions or comments, we're always there as well, and we'll see you guys next time.

219
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,220
Bye.

220
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:23,519
Bye.
