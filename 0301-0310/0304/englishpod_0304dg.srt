00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
EnglishPod.com Ugh, this bathroom is a pigsty.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's wrong?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I just can't stand it.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's really gross in here.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery, so I cleaned it.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You did what?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't help myself.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's just so disgusting in here.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Just leave it to the cleaners, okay?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hang on, I'm just going to quickly wipe this sink and sweep the floor.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're such a neat freak.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm out of here.
