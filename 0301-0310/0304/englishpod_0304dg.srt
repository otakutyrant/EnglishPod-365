00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:06,940
EnglishPod.com Ugh, this bathroom is a pigsty.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,919
Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet?

3
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:10,800
What's wrong?

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,359
I just can't stand it.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,580
It's really gross in here.

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,000
There's a stain on the toilet seat and the floor was wet and slippery, so I cleaned it.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,219
You did what?

8
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,660
Helen, I know it's gross, but I've seen many public washrooms that are much worse.

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,399
Why are you cleaning the countertop?

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,079
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,480
I can't help myself.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,219
It's just so disgusting in here.

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,759
Helen, this is not like your own bathroom.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,740
Just leave it to the cleaners, okay?

15
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,640
Hang on, I'm just going to quickly wipe this sink and sweep the floor.

16
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:40,520
You're such a neat freak.

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,539
I'm out of here.
