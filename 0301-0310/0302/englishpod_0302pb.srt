00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine and today we're talking about fear.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right, today we're going to talk about phobias, different types of fears that you have.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Many people are scared of different things and that's what we're going to talk about today.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, so let's listen to today's dialogue and find out what the people in our dialogue are very, very afraid of.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Are you excited about your trip next month?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes and no.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can't wait to go to Europe but at the same time I'm terrified.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, I have aerophobia.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have a chronic fear of flying.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh really?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's not that bad though, I mean it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700 miles per hour.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I actually have arachnophobia.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're scared of spiders?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I actually have two more phobias, acrophobia and glossophobia.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying but public speaking is not that bad.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you kidding?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When I get on stage my palms start to sweat.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wow.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We are such weirdos, right?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright, we're back so let's take a look at those phobias on Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The first phobia that we have is called aerophobia.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right, aerophobia and that means that you are scared of flying.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, so we can tell because phobia means fear of something but it's not just a fear.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It means that if you go on an airplane you get very very upset.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You think that you're going to die.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay and so phobia is a very serious fear.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But aero like aeroplane is the prefix so aerophobia is a fear of going on airplanes.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right and another phobia that we have is arachnophobia.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So again as you see in the prefix arachnid is related to a spider.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right so this comes from the origins of English.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not sure if it's Greek or Latin but arachnophobia like arachnid has to do with spiders.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So I'm afraid of spiders if I have arachnophobia.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That is right and now taking a look at two more types of phobias here we have acrophobia and glossophobia.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So let's take a look at the first one, acrophobia.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So acrophobia, acro has to do with heights.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I don't like to be on tall buildings.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't like to maybe look down from heights.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That means I'm afraid of heights.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right you're afraid of being at a very high altitude.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Acrophobia.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now glossophobia is an interesting one because this one you are scared of public speaking or you get very nervous when you're in front of a group of people.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right so this is actually a very very common fear but if it's a serious fear it's a phobia.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So glossophobia means that when you go in front of people you get very very anxious, upset, your stomach hurts, you have wet hands.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So that's a very serious fear.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And for our last phobia we have claustrophobia I think is one of the most common ones.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you have claustrophobia you're afraid of smaller tight spaces.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's right so people who, so you heard the word claustrophobic, people who are claustrophobic or people who suffer from claustrophobia don't like to be in small tight places like elevators for example.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Tunnels.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So now you brought up an interesting point.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Our last phobia we said claustrophobic and now we must make the difference between for example claustrophobia and being claustrophobic.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So a phobia, you hear the word I, you hear the ending I A, claustrophobia is a noun okay that means I can talk about I have it, I have this fear but when you're talking about the adjective, something that describes you, you would have to use the ick ending.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm claustrophobic, he is acrophobic, they are aerophobic.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay so that is the adjective form.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So if I say I have arachnophobia it means I have this fear or I can say I am arachnophobic.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Great so this can be used for all other kinds of phobias so when you learn those words remember that there's two different kinds, there's the ia, there's the ia, phobia which is the noun and ick which is the adjective.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Alright let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you excited about your trip next month?

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes and no.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't wait to go to Europe but at the same time I'm terrified.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Why?

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well I have aerophobia, I have a chronic fear of flying.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh really?

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's not that bad though, I mean it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700 miles per hour.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I actually have arachnophobia.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're scared of spiders?

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I actually have two more phobias, acrophobia and glossophobia.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying but public speaking is not that bad.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you kidding?

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
When I get on stage my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We are such weirdos, right?

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All right, so we've picked out a couple of different phrases today.

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Fluency Builder.

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So in the beginning of today's dialogue the character said, I cannot wait to go to Europe but at the same time I'm terrified.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So at the same time.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So in this case we're saying that we are happy but also we are scared.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So two things at once at the same time.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Right, so this is a little bit different from when we talk about I can do two things at the same time.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can walk and chew gum.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When we're talking about feelings or emotions you say, you know, I'm happy but at the same time I'm also scared.

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That means that I have these two feelings and actually they're opposite feelings.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right, exactly.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Usually they are opposite feelings.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So like you say, you're happy but at the same time you're nervous.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's like saying on the other hand.

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right, now when we talked about all these fears, we're afraid of flying, we are afraid of spiders, we describe them as a chronic fear.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay, so this adjective chronic is very important because it has to do with time.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, so I have a chronic fear of heights.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That means this is a fear I've always had and I will always have.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can also say she has chronic back pain.

103
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That means it comes back again and again.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's not just one time.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's all, it's some person's whole life maybe.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Not every day but it comes back.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Right, okay, so that's if you say you have a chronic something you're explaining that you've had it for a while or you will always have it.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Something usually very serious also.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And going back to one of the phobias, we mentioned glossophobia and the other person said, well you know public speaking is not that bad.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not something to be so afraid of.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And the other person replied by saying, are you kidding?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you kidding?

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So this is actually a way of showing some sarcasm when you're talking because public speaking is not that bad.

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The person wants to say, no it is that bad, it is awful.

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, are you kidding is a way to say, no I totally disagree.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Right, so you're being a little bit sarcastic but at the same time you're also acting a bit surprised.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Like, I can't believe you said that.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Like if I said, I really like the Twilight movies, Marco.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Are you kidding?

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Those movies are terrible.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Alright, so Marco does not agree with my opinion.

122
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Alright, now when we're talking about public speaking we mentioned that you get on stage.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So this is very important because this is the action, to get on stage and speak.

124
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, so if you have a stage or maybe even, you don't have a stage, but you're talking about performing in front of other people, like a speech or a play, you say, you get on stage.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And it's important to remember this as a phrase, so whenever I get on stage I start to sweat.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now you may want to add the, there you want to say, to get on the stage.

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But it's not necessary.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's not incorrect but the usual, or let's say more correct form would just be, use the phrase to get on stage.

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When I get on stage I get very nervous.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You don't have to say, when I get on the stage.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Or she's normally very shy but when she gets on stage she opens up and becomes very, very talkative.

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's right.

133
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Alright, so that's all the phrases we've picked out for you.

134
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be right back.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Are you excited about your trip next month?

136
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes and no.

137
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't wait to go to Europe but at the same time I'm terrified.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why?

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, I have aerophobia.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I have a chronic fear of flying.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh really?

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not that bad though.

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I mean, it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700 miles per hour.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I actually have arachnophobia.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're scared of spiders?

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I actually have two more phobias, acrophobia and glossophobia.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying but public speaking is not that bad.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Are you kidding?

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When I get on stage my palms start to sweat.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We are such weirdos, right?

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Alright, so talking about all these phobias.

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Now one of these phobias was actually made into a movie, I think in 1990, arachnophobia.

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This very chronic fear of spiders.

158
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's right.

159
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I remember when I was younger and this movie came out everybody started talking about how they were arachnophobic.

160
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They had this horrible fear of spiders.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Did you ever see that movie?

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, of course.

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Of course.

164
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It was terrifying.

165
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was supposedly some South American spider that made its way into the United States in a box in a crate or something.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now many people handle phobias differently.

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you have any phobia?

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you claustrophobic?

169
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Are you arachnophobic?

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't have any phobias and I'm not really afraid of anything, so I'm pretty lucky that way.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know a number of people who are afraid of heights, arachnophobic, so that's pretty common.

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And actually if you look it up, you will find in the dictionary maybe hundreds of phobias.

173
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:09,000
People who are afraid of open spaces, people who are afraid of closed spaces, or people who are afraid of marriage, they even have a phobia determined for this type of person.

174
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So it's very interesting.

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now this is going to be a challenge.

176
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why don't you look up a couple of different phobias and share it with us?

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Maybe some of the craziest ones or the funniest ones or maybe the strangest ones you can find.

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So look them up.

180
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Share them with us.

181
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All right.

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We'll see you guys there.

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Bye.
