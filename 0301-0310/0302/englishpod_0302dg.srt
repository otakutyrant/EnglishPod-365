00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Are you excited about your trip next month?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, and no.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I can't wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I'm terrified.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Why?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, I have aerophobia.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have a chronic fear of flying.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh really?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not that bad though.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I mean, it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700 miles per hour.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I actually have arachnophobia.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're scared of spiders?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I actually have two more phobias.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Acrophobia and glossophobia.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Are you kidding?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When I get on stage my palms start to sweat.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We are such weirdos, right?
