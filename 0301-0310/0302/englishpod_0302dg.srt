EnglishPod.com Are you excited about your trip next month?

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,779
Yes, and no.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,199
I can't wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I'm terrified.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,359
Why?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,660
Well, I have aerophobia.

6
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,820
I have a chronic fear of flying.

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:22,399
Oh really?

8
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:26,440
I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,440
It's not that bad though.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,159
I mean, it is pretty scary to be up in this big machine flying through the air at 700 miles per hour.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,719
I actually have arachnophobia.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,979
You're scared of spiders?

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,219
I actually have two more phobias.

14
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,359
Acrophobia and glossophobia.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,039
I guess that explains why you're afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,280
Are you kidding?

17
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:55,340
When I get on stage my palms start to sweat.

18
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,159
I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,500
Well, I must confess that I am a bit claustrophobic.

20
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,000
I hate being in an elevator for more than five seconds.

21
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,680
We are such weirdos, right?
