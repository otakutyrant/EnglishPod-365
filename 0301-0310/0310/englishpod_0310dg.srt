00:00:03,119 --> 00:00:09,099
So, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,859
She's my colleague from Brazil.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,380
Maria, this is Michelle.

4
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:13,500
Hi, Michelle.

5
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:15,779
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,800
I mean, what work do you do?

7
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:20,140
I work in advertising right now.

8
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:21,179
How about you?

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
I'm actually in the wine business.

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,120
Oh, that sounds really great.

11
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,559
I love wine myself.

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

13
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:31,679
No, actually, I often visit.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,920
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,140
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai, so that's a good reason to come.

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,119
Me too.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,719
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,000
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,000
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

20
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,659
We should go there together sometime.

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:54,780
Wonderful idea.

22
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:55,859
I'd love that.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,740
Thank you.
