00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
She's my colleague from Brazil.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Maria, this is Michelle.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hi, Michelle.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I mean, what work do you do?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I work in advertising right now.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How about you?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm actually in the wine business.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, that sounds really great.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I love wine myself.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No, actually, I often visit.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai, so that's a good reason to come.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Me too.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We should go there together sometime.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wonderful idea.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'd love that.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you.
