00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have part two of our series about small talk in English.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So as we mentioned, small talk are very short, quick conversations about everyday things like the weather, and you usually have this with a colleague very quickly or a friend maybe.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, maybe not someone you know very well, too.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Exactly.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're going to take a look at part two.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue and see what's going on.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
She's my colleague from Brazil.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Maria, this is Michelle.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hi, Michelle.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I mean, what work do you do?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I work in advertising right now.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How about you?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm actually in the wine business.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, that sounds really great.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I love wine myself.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, actually, I often visit.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So that's a good reason to come.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Me too.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We should go there together sometime.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wonderful idea.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'd love that.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So now let's take a look at some of these very interesting phrases we find in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So the first phrase we have today is from the first sentence of this dialogue.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
James says, so, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So we have the phrase introduce someone to or introduce you to Maria.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, let me introduce you to this person.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So Marco, let me introduce you to my friend.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Right.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And this is something that you say when you want to tell the person, look, you're going to meet someone new.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let me introduce you to my friend, Sally.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And this is very important because it's polite and it's a way for you to say, okay, you two don't know each other.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here, this is, you know, this person's name, this is this person's name.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's very important when you are introducing people or when you're in a situation with two people who don't know each other.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Exactly.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So let me introduce you to someone.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, another key question here, I think probably one of the key questions when you meet someone new, you're talking small talk, short conversation, what do you do here or what do you do?

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you do?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So this might sound like a very strange question.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What do you do?

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you watch TV?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you like to eat food?

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, but this means what job do you do?

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Right.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What type of work do you do?

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So Marco, what do you do?

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I host an English podcast.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All right.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Me too.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So this is the question.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now don't get confused and remember that this is the typical way of asking someone what is their job.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you say, what is your job or what is your occupation?

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is your occupation?

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's too formal and it's kind of awkward.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't think anyone has ever asked me what is your occupation.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, I rarely say that.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I almost always say, what do you do?

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Or maybe what type of work do you do?

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Or what business are you in?

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So this is our next phrase actually.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If someone asks you what business are you in or what industry are you in, you would say like in this case, Maria, she is in the wine business.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm in the wine business.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That means that my job has to do with selling or buying wine.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So if we replace the noun wine with something else, for example, clothing.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm in the clothing business or I'm in the cheese business.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Exactly.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can basically change it with anything.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
With any product.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I guess if you sell computers, I'm in the computer business.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Or if you have anything to do with computers, you can say I'm in the computer business.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All right.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So that's great.

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm in the business.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Exactly.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So now we know what the person does.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We continue asking questions.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We're interested.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We want to keep the conversation going a little while longer.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We say, oh, wow, that's really great.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I love wine myself.

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Then we ask, is this your first time to Shanghai?

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So is this your first time to Shanghai or in Shanghai?

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This means is this your first time to visit Shanghai?

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now, the preposition here is always confusing for an ESL learner because sometimes do you say is this your first time in Shanghai?

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Is this your first time on Shanghai?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now we're saying to Shanghai.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So in this case or in this type of question, both are correct.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is this your first time in Shanghai?

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is this your first time to Shanghai?

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I could also say, you know, if we're in Chicago, hey, Marco, is this your first time in Chicago?

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But I have to ask if we are in that city.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't say, okay, I'm in Chicago today, but Marco, is this your first time in New York?

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Because we're not in New York right now.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That could be confusing.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So remember, when you ask this question, you're asking about where you are today right now.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Exactly.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Very good.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So on that note, let's take a break.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with some more phrases.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She's my colleague from Brazil.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Maria, this is Michelle.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hi, Michelle.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I mean, what work do you do?

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I work in advertising right now.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How about you?

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm actually in the wine business.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, that sounds really great.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I love wine myself.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, actually, I often visit.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So that's a good reason to come.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Me too.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We should go there together sometime.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wonderful idea.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'd love that.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All right, let's take a look at three more key phrases on Fluency Builder Part 2.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fluency Builder So one phrase that we heard from this when things started to get a little bit more personal, Michelle said, I often like to get together with friends.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So this phrase here is to get together with friends.

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So to get together means to be united or go with friends somewhere.

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's right.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So we could also use the phrase to hang out.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This means you're not doing anything in particular.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're not cooking or swimming or going shopping, but it just means you're together with your friends.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You could be doing anything.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right, exactly.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So even if you want to ask your friend or colleague, hey, do you want to get together after work and have a couple of drinks?

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
All right, that means would you like to hang out or would you like to go somewhere for a drink?

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's very informal and it's not romantic.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's just with friends.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Exactly.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So if you ask someone to get together sometime, it doesn't mean let's go out on a date.

161
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It just means, you know, let's hang out.

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's hang out.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's be friends.

164
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now, so they were talking about a Brazilian restaurant and James said, hey, you know, we should go there sometime.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Or we should go there together sometime is even like more personal.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is a really common phrase and one that you guys should remember as a phrase.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We should go there sometime.

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That means that I would like to make plans with you to go to this restaurant.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Right, exactly.

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, if you notice the word sometime is separated, you have some and then apart.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The other word is time.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So it's very different from sometimes.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't confuse it.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What we're saying here is when you have time, when I have time, we should go there.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's almost like saying one time or in the future.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Sometimes it's different.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's like I brush my teeth sometimes.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That means that.

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Not very often.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, that's not true.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But I would like to go there sometime means, you know, it's, it's a little bit vague.

185
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't say when, but I would like to in the future.

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Exactly.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And Michelle agrees.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
She says, well, it's a wonderful idea.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'd love that.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is another great phrase.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Remember this as a phrase.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Would you like to go see a movie?

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'd love that.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'd love that.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So I'd love that.

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'd love to.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
These are ways of saying I like the idea.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's do it.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Exactly.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So it's usually in response to an invitation or suggestion.

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Very good.

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right.

204
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So let's take a look at our dialogue again and review everything.

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And we'll be back in a bit.

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
She's my colleague from Brazil.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Maria, this is Michelle.

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hi, Michelle.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I mean, what work do you do?

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I work in advertising right now.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How about you?

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm actually in the wine business.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, that sounds really great.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I love wine myself.

217
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No.

219
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Actually, I often visit.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

222
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So that's a good reason to come.

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Me too.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

225
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We should go there together sometime.

228
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Wonderful idea.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'd love that.

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All right.

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So as we can see, it's very quick, small conversation, but very good phrases to talk to a stranger, to start up a small conversation.

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I think these are great too, Marco, because if you're learning English and you want to practice your speaking skills, you're not going to have many people to talk about deep things with.

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So it's great to use with strangers or with people in your office.

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And these are common, typical questions, and they're also appropriate to ask someone.

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So obviously, if you meet someone new, you're not going to ask them how much money they make because that's kind of inappropriate in Western culture.

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So what we've taught you here are very polite, very common phrases.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We hope, hope, hope that you'll go out and practice these.

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you have questions or comments, don't hesitate to leave them for us.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
All right.

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We'll see you guys there.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Bye.
