00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:03,940
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:04,679
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:11,019
My name is Katherine, and today we have part two of our series about small talk in English.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:11,699
That's right.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:21,260
So as we mentioned, small talk are very short, quick conversations about everyday things like the weather, and you usually have this with a colleague very quickly or a friend maybe.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,739
Yeah, maybe not someone you know very well, too.

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:24,820
Exactly.

8
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,800
So we're going to take a look at part two.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,539
Why don't we listen to the dialogue and see what's going on.

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,799
So, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,600
She's my colleague from Brazil.

12
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:41,079
Maria, this is Michelle.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,200
Hi, Michelle.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,479
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

15
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:46,520
I mean, what work do you do?

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,880
I work in advertising right now.

17
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:49,899
How about you?

18
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,880
I'm actually in the wine business.

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,840
Oh, that sounds really great.

20
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:55,259
I love wine myself.

21
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,659
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

22
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,380
No, actually, I often visit.

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,640
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,700
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

25
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,900
So that's a good reason to come.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:08,840
Me too.

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,439
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

28
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,700
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,700
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,359
We should go there together sometime.

31
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,519
Wonderful idea.

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,579
I'd love that.

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,859
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,200
So now let's take a look at some of these very interesting phrases we find in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,000
Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,780
So the first phrase we have today is from the first sentence of this dialogue.

37
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:48,599
James says, so, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,599
That's right.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,560
So we have the phrase introduce someone to or introduce you to Maria.

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,840
Okay, let me introduce you to this person.

41
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,920
So Marco, let me introduce you to my friend.

42
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:01,579
Right.

43
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:08,080
And this is something that you say when you want to tell the person, look, you're going to meet someone new.

44
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,719
Let me introduce you to my friend, Sally.

45
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,939
And this is very important because it's polite and it's a way for you to say, okay, you two don't know each other.

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,699
Here, this is, you know, this person's name, this is this person's name.

47
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,759
It's very important when you are introducing people or when you're in a situation with two people who don't know each other.

48
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,560
That's right.

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,240
Exactly.

50
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,900
So let me introduce you to someone.

51
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:42,860
Now, another key question here, I think probably one of the key questions when you meet someone new, you're talking small talk, short conversation, what do you do here or what do you do?

52
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,939
What do you do?

53
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,979
So this might sound like a very strange question.

54
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:46,979
What do you do?

55
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,020
Do you watch TV?

56
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,520
Do you like to eat food?

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,560
No, but this means what job do you do?

58
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:52,960
Right.

59
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,439
What type of work do you do?

60
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:55,939
Okay.

61
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,199
So Marco, what do you do?

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,219
I host an English podcast.

63
00:02:59,539 --> 00:02:59,939
All right.

64
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,479
Me too.

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,919
So this is the question.

66
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:08,020
Now don't get confused and remember that this is the typical way of asking someone what is their job.

67
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,080
If you say, what is your job or what is your occupation?

68
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:13,939
What is your occupation?

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,080
It's too formal and it's kind of awkward.

70
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,900
I don't think anyone has ever asked me what is your occupation.

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,439
No, I rarely say that.

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,900
I almost always say, what do you do?

73
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,800
Or maybe what type of work do you do?

74
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,360
Or what business are you in?

75
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,580
So this is our next phrase actually.

76
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,180
Right.

77
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:39,960
If someone asks you what business are you in or what industry are you in, you would say like in this case, Maria, she is in the wine business.

78
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:40,819
Okay.

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm in the wine business.

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,840
That means that my job has to do with selling or buying wine.

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,240
So if we replace the noun wine with something else, for example, clothing.

82
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm in the clothing business or I'm in the cheese business.

83
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,199
Exactly.

84
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,819
You can basically change it with anything.

85
00:03:58,979 --> 00:03:59,780
With any product.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,860
I guess if you sell computers, I'm in the computer business.

87
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,560
Or if you have anything to do with computers, you can say I'm in the computer business.

88
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,340
All right.

89
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,979
So that's great.

90
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,340
I'm in the business.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,479
Exactly.

92
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:12,599
All right.

93
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,360
So now we know what the person does.

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,259
We continue asking questions.

95
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,180
We're interested.

96
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,899
We want to keep the conversation going a little while longer.

97
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,259
We say, oh, wow, that's really great.

98
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,459
I love wine myself.

99
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,420
Then we ask, is this your first time to Shanghai?

100
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,160
Okay.

101
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,199
So is this your first time to Shanghai or in Shanghai?

102
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,660
This means is this your first time to visit Shanghai?

103
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:35,860
That's right.

104
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:44,060
Now, the preposition here is always confusing for an ESL learner because sometimes do you say is this your first time in Shanghai?

105
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,000
Is this your first time on Shanghai?

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,699
Now we're saying to Shanghai.

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,540
So in this case or in this type of question, both are correct.

108
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,680
Is this your first time in Shanghai?

109
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,920
Is this your first time to Shanghai?

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,420
All right.

111
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,079
So I could also say, you know, if we're in Chicago, hey, Marco, is this your first time in Chicago?

112
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,000
But I have to ask if we are in that city.

113
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,680
I can't say, okay, I'm in Chicago today, but Marco, is this your first time in New York?

114
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,939
Because we're not in New York right now.

115
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,339
That could be confusing.

116
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:18,699
So remember, when you ask this question, you're asking about where you are today right now.

117
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,459
Exactly.

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,240
Very good.

119
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,300
So on that note, let's take a break.

120
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,779
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with some more phrases.

121
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,240
So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

122
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,019
She's my colleague from Brazil.

123
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,500
Maria, this is Michelle.

124
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:38,660
Hi, Michelle.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,899
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

126
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,939
I mean, what work do you do?

127
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,339
I work in advertising right now.

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,300
How about you?

129
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,379
I'm actually in the wine business.

130
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,240
Oh, that sounds really great.

131
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,699
I love wine myself.

132
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,060
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

133
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
No, actually, I often visit.

134
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

135
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,120
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

136
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,279
So that's a good reason to come.

137
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,259
Me too.

138
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,860
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

139
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:13,100
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

140
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:17,120
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

141
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,759
We should go there together sometime.

142
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,920
Wonderful idea.

143
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,360
I'd love that.

144
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,240
All right, let's take a look at three more key phrases on Fluency Builder Part 2.

145
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:42,720
Fluency Builder So one phrase that we heard from this when things started to get a little bit more personal, Michelle said, I often like to get together with friends.

146
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,279
So this phrase here is to get together with friends.

147
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,639
So to get together means to be united or go with friends somewhere.

148
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,500
That's right.

149
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,040
So we could also use the phrase to hang out.

150
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,519
This means you're not doing anything in particular.

151
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,540
You're not cooking or swimming or going shopping, but it just means you're together with your friends.

152
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,759
You could be doing anything.

153
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,100
Right, exactly.

154
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,740
So even if you want to ask your friend or colleague, hey, do you want to get together after work and have a couple of drinks?

155
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,819
All right, that means would you like to hang out or would you like to go somewhere for a drink?

156
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,519
It's very informal and it's not romantic.

157
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,060
Right.

158
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,579
It's just with friends.

159
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,220
Exactly.

160
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,660
So if you ask someone to get together sometime, it doesn't mean let's go out on a date.

161
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,279
It just means, you know, let's hang out.

162
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:29,860
Let's hang out.

163
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,519
Let's be friends.

164
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,100
Okay.

165
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,480
Now, so they were talking about a Brazilian restaurant and James said, hey, you know, we should go there sometime.

166
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:38,800
Okay.

167
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:42,180
Or we should go there together sometime is even like more personal.

168
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,779
This is a really common phrase and one that you guys should remember as a phrase.

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,279
Okay.

170
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,660
We should go there sometime.

171
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,620
That means that I would like to make plans with you to go to this restaurant.

172
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,720
Right, exactly.

173
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,300
Now, if you notice the word sometime is separated, you have some and then apart.

174
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,600
The other word is time.

175
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,759
So it's very different from sometimes.

176
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,939
Don't confuse it.

177
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:09,259
What we're saying here is when you have time, when I have time, we should go there.

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,839
It's almost like saying one time or in the future.

179
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,139
Sometimes it's different.

180
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,699
It's like I brush my teeth sometimes.

181
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,040
That means that.

182
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,139
Not very often.

183
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,120
No, that's not true.

184
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,279
But I would like to go there sometime means, you know, it's, it's a little bit vague.

185
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,220
I don't say when, but I would like to in the future.

186
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,100
Exactly.

187
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,360
And Michelle agrees.

188
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,240
She says, well, it's a wonderful idea.

189
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,799
I'd love that.

190
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,399
Okay.

191
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,980
This is another great phrase.

192
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,659
Remember this as a phrase.

193
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,200
Would you like to go see a movie?

194
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,539
I'd love that.

195
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:42,320
I'd love that.

196
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,539
So I'd love that.

197
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,480
I'd love to.

198
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:46,779
These are ways of saying I like the idea.

199
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,860
Let's do it.

200
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,659
Exactly.

201
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,600
So it's usually in response to an invitation or suggestion.

202
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,259
Very good.

203
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:55,879
All right.

204
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,940
So let's take a look at our dialogue again and review everything.

205
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
And we'll be back in a bit.

206
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,460
So, Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.

207
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,220
She's my colleague from Brazil.

208
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,720
Maria, this is Michelle.

209
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:12,879
Hi, Michelle.

210
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:15,120
So what do you do here in Shanghai?

211
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,120
I mean, what work do you do?

212
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,580
I work in advertising right now.

213
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,519
How about you?

214
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,539
I'm actually in the wine business.

215
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
Oh, that sounds really great.

216
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,899
I love wine myself.

217
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,259
Is this your first time to Shanghai, Maria?

218
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,100
No.

219
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,019
Actually, I often visit.

220
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,259
I usually come to China for business at least once a year.

221
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,320
Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai.

222
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,480
So that's a good reason to come.

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,460
Me too.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,059
Actually, there's a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend.

225
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:47,320
I mean, the food is delicious, but the service isn't so good.

226
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:51,320
I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.

227
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,960
We should go there together sometime.

228
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,139
Wonderful idea.

229
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,460
I'd love that.

230
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,980
All right.

231
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:07,500
So as we can see, it's very quick, small conversation, but very good phrases to talk to a stranger, to start up a small conversation.

232
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:18,039
I think these are great too, Marco, because if you're learning English and you want to practice your speaking skills, you're not going to have many people to talk about deep things with.

233
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,159
So it's great to use with strangers or with people in your office.

234
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:22,960
That's right.

235
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,519
And these are common, typical questions, and they're also appropriate to ask someone.

236
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:34,139
So obviously, if you meet someone new, you're not going to ask them how much money they make because that's kind of inappropriate in Western culture.

237
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:34,980
That's right.

238
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,080
So what we've taught you here are very polite, very common phrases.

239
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,360
We hope, hope, hope that you'll go out and practice these.

240
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,879
If you have questions or comments, don't hesitate to leave them for us.

241
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,620
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

242
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:46,980
All right.

243
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:47,620
We'll see you guys there.

244
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:48,039
Bye.
