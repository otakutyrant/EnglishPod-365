1
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:10,439
So, where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,240
It's an Indian restaurant.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,420
I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try it.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,120
That sounds great!

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,079
I am craving some type of beef dish.

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:25,640
Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,979
You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,280
I see.

9
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,280
So, what are we having, chicken?

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,700
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,640
We can have some chicken tikka masala, which is an amazing curry.

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
It's a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,840
Sounds good!

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,479
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

15
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:53,060
Yeah.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,840
Also, we can have some naan bread, which is baked in a tandoori oven.

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:02,159
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice.

18
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,320
What about veggies?

19
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:10,079
Oh, they have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas, or dal.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,939
It all sounds so exquisite.

21
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,719
I can't wait.
