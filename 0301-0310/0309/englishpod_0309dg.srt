1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's an Indian restaurant.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try it.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That sounds great!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I am craving some type of beef dish.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I see.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, what are we having, chicken?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We can have some chicken tikka masala, which is an amazing curry.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Sounds good!

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Also, we can have some naan bread, which is baked in a tandoori oven.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What about veggies?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, they have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas, or dal.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It all sounds so exquisite.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't wait.
