00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,940
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,800
And if you've been listening to our recent lessons, you know that we've been talking a lot about food.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:11,660
That's right.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,640
And today we have another lesson all about food from a different country.

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:19,059
Last time we took a look at Mexican food, Chinese food.

8
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:21,679
Now, we are talking about Indian food.

9
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:22,260
Okay.

10
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,460
Indian food is very famous for being spicy, but not all of it is spicy.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,700
Okay, let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out just what kinds of food you will find at an Indian restaurant.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,640
So where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,460
It's an Indian restaurant.

14
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:49,579
I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try it.

15
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,320
That sounds great.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
I am craving some type of beef dish.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,820
Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:05,159
You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.

19
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:06,480
I see.

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,780
So what are we having?

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:08,480
Chicken?

22
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:11,900
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

23
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,840
We can have some chicken chikka masala, which is an amazing curry.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,099
It's a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.

25
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,060
Sounds good.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,700
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,019
Also, we can have some naan bread, which is baked in a tandoori oven.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:34,340
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice.

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,500
What about veggies?

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,280
Oh, they have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas, or dal.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
It all sounds so exquisite.

32
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,939
I can't wait.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,920
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,260
So now let's take a look at a couple of words and phrases here on language takeaway.

35
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,900
Language takeaway.

36
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,799
So in this first language takeaway today, we have words that are about the kinds of food we're eating today.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,439
So the first one, the character said, I am craving some type of beef.

38
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,259
So to crave something.

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,759
Okay, so that is a verb, to crave, and that means that you have a desire.

40
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,139
You really want to eat something, to have a particular thing.

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,560
That's right.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,319
But it's particular.

43
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,879
So it's something specific.

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,300
For example, pregnant women are famous for craving strange foods like pickles.

45
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,379
Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:39,300
So if you say I'm craving some ice cream, you specifically want ice cream or maybe vanilla ice cream.

47
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,020
Exactly.

48
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:46,479
And this person wants beef, but unfortunately there is no beef at Indian restaurants because cows are what?

49
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,080
Cows are a sacred animal.

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,979
So they are sacred in India.

51
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,819
Sacred means special or somehow important in a religious way.

52
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,039
For example, you could say this is a very sacred place.

53
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:05,479
So please don't use cameras or phones and take your shoes off.

54
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,439
That's right.

55
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,439
So the word sacred refers to something that is religious and very important for that religion.

56
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,599
And specifically in this occasion, we're talking about the Hindu religion.

57
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:30,419
Okay, so the Hindu religion or Hinduism is a religion that's widely practiced in the world and maybe most commonly found in India.

58
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:40,360
So you'll see a lot of Hindu temples in India and people don't eat beef like we said because cows are sacred in the Hindu religion.

59
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,199
That's right.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, so now in India or for Indian food, it's common to not use any type of utensil to eat.

61
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,240
Okay, so you might be wondering, what is a utensil?

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,020
I know forks, I know spoons.

63
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:01,620
Well, utensil is the word that describes all forks, spoons and knives, things that you eat with.

64
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,840
Okay, so utensils are tools for eating and it's a very general category.

65
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,020
Right, exactly.

66
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,020
So utensils are spoons, forks, knives, everything.

67
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,439
Chopsticks are utensils even.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
Okay, very good.

69
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:22,360
And now since we don't use any utensils, you usually eat with your hand and you scoop up the food, the rice or the curry.

70
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,620
Okay, to scoop up, this is a verb and usually you use your hands to scoop something.

71
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,019
So in this case, I can use a piece of bread to scoop up or to pick up some food.

72
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:34,779
That's right.

73
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:46,939
So the verb to scoop up, it usually means that you somehow make a little bowl or a little figure with your hand so that the liquid or the food will fit inside, kind of like a little scoop.

74
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,579
Or a little cup, that's right.

75
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:48,920
Exactly.

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,060
So to scoop up, scoop something up.

77
00:04:51,399 --> 00:05:00,000
Alright, so now let's go back, let's review this dialogue and when we come back, we're going to take a look at the specific Indian dishes found in this dialogue.

78
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:10,019
So, where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

79
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:11,800
It's an Indian restaurant.

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,019
I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try it.

81
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,699
That sounds great.

82
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:21,680
I am craving some type of beef dish.

83
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,220
Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

84
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,560
You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.

85
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,879
I see.

86
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,879
So what are we having, chicken?

87
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,319
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

88
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,220
We can have some chicken tikka masala, which is an amazing curry.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,519
It's a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.

90
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:48,439
Sounds good.

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,079
I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

92
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,639
Yeah.

93
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:56,459
Also, we can have some naan bread, which is baked in a tandoori oven.

94
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,720
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice.

95
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:02,959
What about veggies?

96
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,680
Oh, they have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas, or dal.

97
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,540
It all sounds so exquisite.

98
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,420
I can't wait.

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,300
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at those dishes on Language Takeaway Part 2.

100
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh, Marco, these lessons are making me so hungry.

101
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,379
We've been doing them for a couple of weeks now, and this one is no exception.

102
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:34,600
We talked a little bit today about chicken dishes and vegetable dishes, but a very general kind of dish in Indian food is a curry.

103
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,980
That's right, a curry.

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,980
Now, this is a naan, and it's a dish that has a variety of spices in it.

105
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,000
That's right, so there are many different flavors, not just one flavor.

106
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:57,920
You can have chicken curries and vegetable curries and mutton or lamb curries, but the thing that you need to remember in Indian food is that there's usually different colors of curry, red, yellow, or green curries.

107
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:58,519
That's right.

108
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,480
Exactly.

109
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:07,939
So the dishes are usually called curries, and an example of a curry, we have a chicken tikka masala curry.

110
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:18,800
Okay, so we know that there's chicken in it, and tikka means that it's grilled chicken, and masala is the name of the spice or the curry, the spice that's in that curry.

111
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,480
Exactly, exactly.

112
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:27,259
So a curry is kind of like a thick sauce with pieces of chicken in it, in this case for the chicken tikka masala.

113
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,759
It's a little bit spicy, and it's a color red.

114
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:45,040
Alright, so we've got the chicken tikka masala, or masala, and usually you eat this with rice or bread, but in India there's a special, there are many different kinds of bread, but the special bread we heard today was called naan bread.

115
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:46,300
Right, naan bread.

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:55,819
And it's just basically a type of bread, now it's not like the bread that you usually have at home, it's a flat bread, so it kind of looks like a pancake almost.

117
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:03,720
It does, it's not fluffy, it's flat, and the way they cook it is they use this special oven and they cook it inside the oven.

118
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,620
Now the question is, what is that oven called, Marco?

119
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,079
That's right, the oven that we heard is a tandoori oven.

120
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:27,579
Okay, so tandoori is just the name of this oven, it's also a style of cooking in India, and it's actually one of my favorite kinds of Indian food because you have these many different kinds of grilled meats, you can have tandoori chicken, tandoori mutton, things like that.

121
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:34,440
Exactly, so a tandoori oven is a type of oven usually made from clay, that's why it's called tandoori.

122
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:51,480
Now towards the end we also have some vegetarian options because as we heard in India they don't eat beef, and many people are also vegetarians, they don't eat any type of meat at all, so the first vegetable-based dish that we heard is a palak paneer.

123
00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:11,340
That's interesting actually because paneer is curd or like a cheese type of thing, so it's usually white and comes in rectangles, and paneer you can have many different flavors of it, but paneer generally is kind of a cheese, like a cottage cheese.

124
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:25,580
That's right, and palak is actually spinach, so it's a dish that it kind of looks like a thick sauce, green sauce, which is made out of spinach, and within it it has little pieces of this type of cheese.

125
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:26,940
I love this dish.

126
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:28,220
It's very, very delicious.

127
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:30,919
We also have vegetable samosas.

128
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,500
Now a samosa, what's that?

129
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,360
This is a great dish, this is often used as an appetizer or as a snack.

130
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,320
You see these on carts or on the street in India.

131
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:56,840
Now samosas are like pyramids or triangles, and inside they have vegetables, so you can have potatoes and peas or lentil, no not lentils, you can have potatoes and peas, and they're a little bit crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and they're very tasty.

132
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:05,080
I guess the equivalent would be to, it's something like an egg roll, or like a dumpling, because it is deep fried, it's deep fried.

133
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:12,179
And we also have dal, so this is actually a type of lentil as you mentioned.

134
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:22,919
That's right, so dal is a lentil dish, and it can be flavored in different ways, but basically lentils are these very, very, very, very small round things.

135
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,320
They're very good for your health.

136
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,799
And dal is kind of a soupy lentil dish.

137
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,179
That's right, so lentil is the category of this type of, I don't know if it's, it's not a grain, it's a legume.

138
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,639
It's a legume, exactly.

139
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:53,679
So it may sound a little bit weird, but we'll post some pictures of different types of lentils, because it's like saying potatoes, there are many different types of potatoes, sweet potato and all this, and the same thing goes with lentils, so we'll post some pictures so you can see what it looks like.

140
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,200
But now why don't we go back, let's listen to the dialogue again, let's review everything and we'll be right back.

141
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:09,159
So, where is this mystery restaurant that we're going to?

142
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,940
It's an Indian restaurant.

143
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,139
I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try it.

144
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:17,840
That sounds great!

145
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,799
I am craving some type of beef dish.

146
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,360
Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn't serve beef.

147
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,700
You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element in the Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.

148
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,000
I see, so what are we having, chicken?

149
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,440
There are many amazing dishes to choose from.

150
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:46,659
We can have some chicken chikka masala, which is an amazing curry, it's a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.

151
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,200
Sounds good, I've always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.

152
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,559
Yeah, also we can have some naan bread, which is baked in a tandoori oven.

153
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,899
Since you don't use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice.

154
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,019
What about veggies?

155
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,799
Oh, they have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas, or dal.

156
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,500
It all sounds so exquisite, I can't wait.

157
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,159
All right, we're back, so Indian food has a reputation of being spicy, but it's very, very delicious.

158
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:29,679
That's right, and you know, what people always tell me, at least my Indian friends always tell me, is that saying Indian food is like saying Chinese food.

159
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,639
We have some general idea, but every different part of India has its own special foods.

160
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:48,080
And so what we get in America at Indian restaurants might not be the same as what we get at the Indian restaurants in India, so I just want to say that, but generally you can find these dishes at any Indian restaurant in America.

161
00:12:48,279 --> 00:13:03,039
That's right, actually if next time you're in an Indian restaurant or if you ever go, ask them from what region or what area of India the food is from, because it may be Northern Indian cuisine, and obviously that is going to be a little bit different than maybe the Southern.

162
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,379
I think the Southern is supposed to be spicier.

163
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:15,340
Exactly, and it's just like in every country, even in our own home countries, maybe the food from the coast or from the North will be different from the South or the Inlands.

164
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,480
And I just want to make one more comment.

165
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,019
One of my favorite things to do that many Indian restaurants offer in America is the lunch buffet.

166
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,820
So a buffet is basically a self-serve of food.

167
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,840
So the restaurant will put out many different dishes, and you can take as much as you want of each, but you pay one price.

168
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,740
Alright, so it's $11.99 or something.

169
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:38,879
That's very, very good.

170
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:46,600
And yeah, so I often do this when I'm home in the States, and I just, you know, I get to pick my favorite dishes and I eat as much as I want.

171
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:54,740
And actually I think one other thing that's worth mentioning, we didn't mention in the dialogue, but the Indian sweets and the tea is very, very good.

172
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,259
The milk tea that they drink in India is delicious, and the sweets are very, very good.

173
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,059
That's right.

174
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,440
They're famous for being very good and not very healthy for you.

175
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,019
Yeah, exactly.

176
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,740
They're very sweet.

177
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,559
If you're in an Indian restaurant, take note, look for these different things.

178
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,940
And let us know, do you like to eat Indian food?

179
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,539
If so, what's your favorite dish?

180
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:20,799
