00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a very popular kind of movie.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right, today we're talking about Twilight and all the creatures that you can find in this new movie.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so the name of the movie is Twilight.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You wanna go to the movies tonight?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sure!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What's playing?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The new Twilight movie!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Twilight?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As in the vampire movies?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No way am I watching that.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It doesn't make sense.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Of course it does!

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they are so different.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy and there you have it.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't buy into that, I think it's just a fad.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alright we're back, so now let's just jump into some vocab, let's take a look at what we've chosen for you on Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Language Takeaway Okay so on Language Takeaway today, Marco, we have three different kinds of creature or monster.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right, so if anyone knows about the movie Twilight, it's mostly about vampires.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right, so vampires are a kind of imaginary creature that like to suck people's blood.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They have long teeth.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's right, so they look like people and they go out at night and they drink people's blood.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And they can't stand in the sunlight because they will die if they're in the sunlight.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's right.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Alright, so we have vampires and also another type of imaginary creature that we find here is werewolves.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We can find werewolves.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, so you know the word wolf, a wolf is an animal, but a werewolf is a man or a woman who turns into an animal when the moon is full.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right, so you're a man or a woman by day, but then at night when there is a full moon you transform into a wolf, so you are a werewolf.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And we have one other kind of monster here, this is a very disgusting kind of monster called a zombie.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright, also very popular in the movies you have zombies, so they're people who are dead but they're still alive.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right, so they can't think, all they want to do is eat other people.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And they're usually very very stupid and you have to cut their heads off to kill them.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right, so zombies are also a very popular type of creature in these movies, so we have three creatures, vampires, werewolves, and zombies.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But now let's move on to some of the other vocab that we found.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When the friend was explaining about the movie and how it's very cool, she said that the cast is hip.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, so something that is hip is also very cool.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So a hip person is someone who is really interesting or cool or maybe up to date current.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Right, very popular.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So for example you can also talk about a place, a restaurant, or a club as being very hip.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right, so you can say, these days, bell-bottom pants are not hip anymore.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They were hip in the 1970s.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's right, so they're not cool, they're not popular, they're not up to date.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now moving on to the end of that paragraph, we see that the explanation continued in saying that the movie makes it even more enticing having a hip cast and a sexy theme.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So something that is enticing makes you want it, okay?

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So an enticing movie attracts people.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So I find warm apple pie very enticing.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It makes me want to eat it.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, so something that is enticing basically makes you want to have it or it makes you desire it.

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Exactly.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, and our last word for language takeaway when the friend was kind of skeptical and said, you know what, I think it's just a fad.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, something is a fad if it is a passing trend.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So it's not always popular, it's only popular for a short time.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So the word is fad, f-a-d.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It sounds very similar to fat, but it's not, it's a fad.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Fad.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So we can say that Twilight is a fad, it's something that's popular now but that might not be popular in two years.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Exactly.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So it's something that's very popular now, but maybe later it won't be like, maybe for example Harry Potter was a fad.

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Exactly.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So that's language takeaway for today, but don't go anywhere, we still have some great phrases for you coming up in Fluency Builder.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You want to go to the movies tonight?

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sure!

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's playing?

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The new Twilight movie!

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Twilight?

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
As in the vampire movies?

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No way am I watching that.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It doesn't make sense.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Of course it does!

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they are so different.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy, and there you have it.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't buy into that.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think it's just a fad.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The first phrase that we have today is related to this idea of going to the movies, and so one of the characters today said, sure, I want to go to the movies.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's playing?

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right, now this question is a key question and you can use this whenever you want to know what movie is currently being shown at the theater, or at the cinema.

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, so what movie is playing?

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There are many movies playing, or there are no good movies playing tonight.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So a movie plays at a theater.

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Exactly.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you want to know what movie is playing?

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You say, what movie is playing tonight?

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Alright.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So now for our next phrase, this is actually going back to the qualities of vampires.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
One of the people in the dialogue described vampires as having superhuman strength.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay, so in this case, super means more than.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So superhuman strength is more than what's normal for a human being, so maybe a human can pick up a table, but superhuman strength means that if I have it, maybe I can pick up a car or something that's very unusual.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They're very heavy.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right, so superhuman strength, we're talking about how strong you are.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And then you can also mix it up with other qualities of a person.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So for example, you can have superhuman speed, you're very, very fast.

104
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Superman is someone who had both superhuman strength and superhuman speed.

105
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's right.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So it's a way to describe a person having a quality that's more than normal.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And for our next phrase, after superhuman strength and something that's really sexy, that person says, and there you have it.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And there you have it.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So why do you end that sentence where, and there you have it?

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And there you have it means, and that's the explanation why.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So let's think of the question.

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The question is, why do people like these vampire movies?

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And the other person said, well, vampires are sexy, and they're immortal, and they have superhuman strength, and there you have it.

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Right.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So that means, and that's why.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay, so it's usually this phrase, and there you have it, you have to explain something or give a couple of ideas before you say it, before you use it.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Exactly.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And the key here is that, and there you have it, comes at the end of that statement.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Always.

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, you know, why is Jim popular?

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You could say, well, he's funny, he's smart, he's good looking, and there you have it.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Right.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Perfect.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So you're basically saying, and that's the reason why.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
All right.

128
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And for our last phrase, when we were talking about a fad, the person said, pretty soon this will pass, and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So this might seem a little bit confusing.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What does it mean by everyone will be into werewolves and zombies?

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so let's take a look at this as a phrase.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
To be into.

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I am into something.

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You are into something.

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This means I am interested in.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So I could say, I am into books and movies.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Marco, what are you into?

138
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So if I say, I am into surfing and bungee jumping.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I would say, it sounds like you're interested in, or it sounds like you like sports.

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Extreme sports.

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So you can be not only into activities, but you can be into a specific type of movies.

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
For example, I'm really into horror movies.

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And I could say, I'm not into horror movies.

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I am into romantic comedies.

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So it's another way of saying that you enjoy it or you like it, or you realize some type of activity.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right.

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's it for Fluency Builder.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's take another listen to today's dialogue and we'll be right back.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You want to go to the movies tonight?

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's playing?

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The new Twilight movie.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Twilight?

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
As in the vampire movies?

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No way am I watching that.

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It doesn't make sense.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Of course it does.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You have a couple that is in love, but can't be together because they're so different.

161
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And there you have it.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Plus, the cast is hip.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Young people that make the movie even more enticing.

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't buy into that.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think it's just a fad.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
All right, we're back.

169
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So obviously the dialogue revolves around Twilight and vampires, but mostly it's all about, as we said, something that's hip, that's current, that's popular now, but many times is also a fad.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's right.

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So let's think.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What was a fad from the 1980s?

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think the 80s, the fad was, maybe we can talk about the hairstyles.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Men and women had those big kind of hairstyles, long in the back and very, very tall in the front.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's right.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So in the 80s, as far as fashion fads, things that were only popular for a short time, we had big hair and we had bright colors like electric pink and green and blue.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And also those t-shirts that would change color when it was hot or cold.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, those are really cool.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think those should come back.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Those were super hip.

181
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, and now it's hip to wear 80s clothes.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So it's another fad.

183
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right, exactly.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because then that's called that you're being, you like, what is it?

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Retro.

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Retro.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Retro means you like to use styles from a long time ago.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So yeah, 70s style, 80s style.

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And well, in the movies now, the fad before was magic and sorcerers.

191
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You had Harry Potter.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Now it's turned to vampires.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's right.

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I wonder what the fad will be in a couple of years.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't think, I don't agree with the person in today's dialogue.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't think zombies will be a fad.

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There was a short period a couple of years ago when there were many, many zombie movies.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
For example, Resident Evil or Shaun of the Dead.

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But I wonder in the future if we're going to be seeing movies about other things.

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, I imagine, maybe not in these creatures, I don't know, I guess vampires have always been kind of sexy because as you know, they're immortal and they're usually very good looking and charming and that's how they get their victims.

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But it's interesting to see, let us know, we're really curious if there are any local fads in your country because sometimes fads can be regional.

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's right.

203
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So let us know what you're into.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Say I'm into this.

205
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Alright, we'll see you guys there.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Bye.
