00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:09,160
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about a very popular kind of movie.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:16,739
That's right, today we're talking about Twilight and all the creatures that you can find in this new movie.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,399
Okay, so the name of the movie is Twilight.

5
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,160
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

6
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:31,100
You wanna go to the movies tonight?

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:31,760
Sure!

8
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:32,880
What's playing?

9
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,200
The new Twilight movie!

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,719
Twilight?

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,340
As in the vampire movies?

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,899
No way am I watching that.

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,600
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires.

14
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:47,460
It doesn't make sense.

15
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:48,920
Of course it does!

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,460
It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,100
You have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they are so different.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,700
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy and there you have it.

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,939
Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,340
I don't buy into that, I think it's just a fad.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,579
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

22
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:25,340
Alright we're back, so now let's just jump into some vocab, let's take a look at what we've chosen for you on Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:35,959
Language Takeaway Okay so on Language Takeaway today, Marco, we have three different kinds of creature or monster.

24
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,799
That's right, so if anyone knows about the movie Twilight, it's mostly about vampires.

25
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:49,239
That's right, so vampires are a kind of imaginary creature that like to suck people's blood.

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:49,900
Right.

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,980
They have long teeth.

28
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,640
That's right, so they look like people and they go out at night and they drink people's blood.

29
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,579
And they can't stand in the sunlight because they will die if they're in the sunlight.

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,260
That's right.

31
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:09,800
Alright, so we have vampires and also another type of imaginary creature that we find here is werewolves.

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,159
We can find werewolves.

33
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:20,379
Okay, so you know the word wolf, a wolf is an animal, but a werewolf is a man or a woman who turns into an animal when the moon is full.

34
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:30,680
Right, so you're a man or a woman by day, but then at night when there is a full moon you transform into a wolf, so you are a werewolf.

35
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,520
And we have one other kind of monster here, this is a very disgusting kind of monster called a zombie.

36
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright, also very popular in the movies you have zombies, so they're people who are dead but they're still alive.

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,060
That's right, so they can't think, all they want to do is eat other people.

38
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,340
And they're usually very very stupid and you have to cut their heads off to kill them.

39
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:02,939
That's right, so zombies are also a very popular type of creature in these movies, so we have three creatures, vampires, werewolves, and zombies.

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,340
But now let's move on to some of the other vocab that we found.

41
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:14,039
When the friend was explaining about the movie and how it's very cool, she said that the cast is hip.

42
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,599
Okay, so something that is hip is also very cool.

43
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:24,419
So a hip person is someone who is really interesting or cool or maybe up to date current.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,560
Right, very popular.

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,800
So for example you can also talk about a place, a restaurant, or a club as being very hip.

46
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:38,539
That's right, so you can say, these days, bell-bottom pants are not hip anymore.

47
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,000
They were hip in the 1970s.

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,900
That's right, so they're not cool, they're not popular, they're not up to date.

49
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:57,360
Now moving on to the end of that paragraph, we see that the explanation continued in saying that the movie makes it even more enticing having a hip cast and a sexy theme.

50
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:01,719
So something that is enticing makes you want it, okay?

51
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,280
So an enticing movie attracts people.

52
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,919
So I find warm apple pie very enticing.

53
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,659
It makes me want to eat it.

54
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:19,420
Okay, so something that is enticing basically makes you want to have it or it makes you desire it.

55
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,100
Exactly.

56
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, and our last word for language takeaway when the friend was kind of skeptical and said, you know what, I think it's just a fad.

57
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,660
Okay, something is a fad if it is a passing trend.

58
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,740
So it's not always popular, it's only popular for a short time.

59
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,500
So the word is fad, f-a-d.

60
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,220
It sounds very similar to fat, but it's not, it's a fad.

61
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:44,879
Fad.

62
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,240
So we can say that Twilight is a fad, it's something that's popular now but that might not be popular in two years.

63
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,980
Exactly.

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,339
So it's something that's very popular now, but maybe later it won't be like, maybe for example Harry Potter was a fad.

65
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,240
Exactly.

66
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:07,019
So that's language takeaway for today, but don't go anywhere, we still have some great phrases for you coming up in Fluency Builder.

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,360
You want to go to the movies tonight?

68
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:15,060
Sure!

69
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,180
What's playing?

70
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,480
The new Twilight movie!

71
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,019
Twilight?

72
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,519
As in the vampire movies?

73
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,199
No way am I watching that.

74
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,839
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,800
It doesn't make sense.

76
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,139
Of course it does!

77
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,740
It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

78
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,379
You have a couple that is in love but can't be together because they are so different.

79
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,899
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy, and there you have it.

80
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,199
Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,959
I don't buy into that.

82
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,639
I think it's just a fad.

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,879
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

84
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,579
Alright we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:20,199
The first phrase that we have today is related to this idea of going to the movies, and so one of the characters today said, sure, I want to go to the movies.

86
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,660
What's playing?

87
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:32,360
That's right, now this question is a key question and you can use this whenever you want to know what movie is currently being shown at the theater, or at the cinema.

88
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,120
Okay, so what movie is playing?

89
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,360
There are many movies playing, or there are no good movies playing tonight.

90
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,079
That's right.

91
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:42,939
So a movie plays at a theater.

92
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,560
Exactly.

93
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,300
So you want to know what movie is playing?

94
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,620
You say, what movie is playing tonight?

95
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,779
Alright.

96
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,779
So now for our next phrase, this is actually going back to the qualities of vampires.

97
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,300
One of the people in the dialogue described vampires as having superhuman strength.

98
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,019
Okay, so in this case, super means more than.

99
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:19,519
So superhuman strength is more than what's normal for a human being, so maybe a human can pick up a table, but superhuman strength means that if I have it, maybe I can pick up a car or something that's very unusual.

100
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,620
They're very heavy.

101
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:25,319
That's right, so superhuman strength, we're talking about how strong you are.

102
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,959
And then you can also mix it up with other qualities of a person.

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,379
So for example, you can have superhuman speed, you're very, very fast.

104
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:40,720
Superman is someone who had both superhuman strength and superhuman speed.

105
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:41,439
That's right.

106
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,040
So it's a way to describe a person having a quality that's more than normal.

107
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:53,819
And for our next phrase, after superhuman strength and something that's really sexy, that person says, and there you have it.

108
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,339
And there you have it.

109
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,079
So why do you end that sentence where, and there you have it?

110
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,180
And there you have it means, and that's the explanation why.

111
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:03,920
Okay.

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
So let's think of the question.

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,060
The question is, why do people like these vampire movies?

114
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:18,120
And the other person said, well, vampires are sexy, and they're immortal, and they have superhuman strength, and there you have it.

115
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,480
Right.

116
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,060
So that means, and that's why.

117
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:31,620
Okay, so it's usually this phrase, and there you have it, you have to explain something or give a couple of ideas before you say it, before you use it.

118
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:31,980
All right.

119
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,700
Exactly.

120
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,139
And the key here is that, and there you have it, comes at the end of that statement.

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:37,679
Always.

122
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,179
Well, you know, why is Jim popular?

123
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,399
You could say, well, he's funny, he's smart, he's good looking, and there you have it.

124
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:47,779
Right.

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,659
Perfect.

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,720
So you're basically saying, and that's the reason why.

127
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:52,919
All right.

128
00:08:52,919 --> 00:09:04,159
And for our last phrase, when we were talking about a fad, the person said, pretty soon this will pass, and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

129
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,139
So this might seem a little bit confusing.

130
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,200
What does it mean by everyone will be into werewolves and zombies?

131
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,460
Okay, so let's take a look at this as a phrase.

132
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
To be into.

133
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,820
I am into something.

134
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,200
You are into something.

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,960
This means I am interested in.

136
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,940
So I could say, I am into books and movies.

137
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,200
Marco, what are you into?

138
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,000
So if I say, I am into surfing and bungee jumping.

139
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,240
I would say, it sounds like you're interested in, or it sounds like you like sports.

140
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,759
Extreme sports.

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,720
So you can be not only into activities, but you can be into a specific type of movies.

142
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,059
For example, I'm really into horror movies.

143
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,980
And I could say, I'm not into horror movies.

144
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,179
I am into romantic comedies.

145
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,600
Okay.

146
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,220
So it's another way of saying that you enjoy it or you like it, or you realize some type of activity.

147
00:09:59,279 --> 00:09:59,679
All right.

148
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,440
That's it for Fluency Builder.

149
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,779
Let's take another listen to today's dialogue and we'll be right back.

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,820
You want to go to the movies tonight?

151
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,600
What's playing?

152
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,980
The new Twilight movie.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,460
Twilight?

154
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,080
As in the vampire movies?

155
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,580
No way am I watching that.

156
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,279
I don't understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires.

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,279
It doesn't make sense.

158
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,620
Of course it does.

159
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,179
It's like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet.

160
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,799
You have a couple that is in love, but can't be together because they're so different.

161
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,120
Add in the fact that immortality and superhuman strength is really sexy.

162
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
And there you have it.

163
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,960
Plus, the cast is hip.

164
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,620
Young people that make the movie even more enticing.

165
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:48,360
I don't buy into that.

166
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,000
I think it's just a fad.

167
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:55,320
Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies.

168
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,039
All right, we're back.

169
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:12,659
So obviously the dialogue revolves around Twilight and vampires, but mostly it's all about, as we said, something that's hip, that's current, that's popular now, but many times is also a fad.

170
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:13,600
That's right.

171
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,960
So let's think.

172
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
What was a fad from the 1980s?

173
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,379
I think the 80s, the fad was, maybe we can talk about the hairstyles.

174
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:31,039
Men and women had those big kind of hairstyles, long in the back and very, very tall in the front.

175
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,659
That's right.

176
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:44,019
So in the 80s, as far as fashion fads, things that were only popular for a short time, we had big hair and we had bright colors like electric pink and green and blue.

177
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,960
And also those t-shirts that would change color when it was hot or cold.

178
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,120
Oh, those are really cool.

179
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:51,639
I think those should come back.

180
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,600
Those were super hip.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,460
Well, and now it's hip to wear 80s clothes.

182
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,379
So it's another fad.

183
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,220
Right, exactly.

184
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:03,320
Because then that's called that you're being, you like, what is it?

185
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:03,759
Retro.

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,340
Retro.

187
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:04,919
Yeah.

188
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:10,919
Retro means you like to use styles from a long time ago.

189
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,539
So yeah, 70s style, 80s style.

190
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,659
And well, in the movies now, the fad before was magic and sorcerers.

191
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,659
You had Harry Potter.

192
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,679
Now it's turned to vampires.

193
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,539
That's right.

194
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,279
I wonder what the fad will be in a couple of years.

195
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,059
I don't think, I don't agree with the person in today's dialogue.

196
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,419
I don't think zombies will be a fad.

197
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,620
There was a short period a couple of years ago when there were many, many zombie movies.

198
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,980
For example, Resident Evil or Shaun of the Dead.

199
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,960
But I wonder in the future if we're going to be seeing movies about other things.

200
00:12:46,179 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah, I imagine, maybe not in these creatures, I don't know, I guess vampires have always been kind of sexy because as you know, they're immortal and they're usually very good looking and charming and that's how they get their victims.

201
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:11,220
But it's interesting to see, let us know, we're really curious if there are any local fads in your country because sometimes fads can be regional.

202
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:11,919
That's right.

203
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,980
So let us know what you're into.

204
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:15,500
Say I'm into this.

205
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,940
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

206
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,019
Alright, we'll see you guys there.

207
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:19,360
Bye.
