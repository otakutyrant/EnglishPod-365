00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,339
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,380
My name is Catherine, and Marco, I can tell you right now, I'm already hungry just thinking about our lesson today.

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,019
That's right.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,240
Today we have another food lesson.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,620
Our world cuisine lesson for today is all about Mexican food.

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:19,460
Okay.

8
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:26,679
Mexican food comes from the country Mexico, but also parts of the United States like Texas have something called Tex-Mex.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,500
So you're going to hear a lot about these kinds of foods there.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,219
Let's check out today's dialogue.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,679
Hello, sir.

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,219
Welcome to Pistolero restaurant.

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,340
May I take your order?

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,240
Yes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

15
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,619
Sorry, sir, but we ran out of chicken.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,240
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,219
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,380
Sure.

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,320
I'll have the burrito.

20
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,719
Do you have nachos?

21
00:00:59,299 --> 00:00:59,960
Of course, sir.

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,200
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,380
Sounds good.

24
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,060
Would you like anything to drink?

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,079
Sure.

26
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll have a corona.

27
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:10,599
All right.

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,019
We're back.

29
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,140
So a lot of great dishes from Mexico.

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,480
Let's take a closer look at some of those on Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,040
Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:24,840
So first up, Marco, we have the word enchilada.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,859
That's right.

34
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,920
We have some chicken cheese enchilada.

35
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,939
So this dish has chicken and cheese, but an enchilada.

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,540
What is that?

37
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:33,359
Okay.

38
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,099
So it's basically a wrap that is covered in cheese, right?

39
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,019
That's right.

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,659
So it has a base of a flour tortilla.

41
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,780
So a tortilla is like a wrap, as you said.

42
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,099
Let's consider it as flatbread.

43
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,200
Very thin.

44
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:47,900
Very thin.

45
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,060
And it rolls up and it's covered with cheese and inside it has chicken.

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:51,840
Very, very good.

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,579
That's right.

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,379
And just a warning.

49
00:01:53,379 --> 00:02:00,959
You're going to hear me say the American pronunciation, enchilada, and you're going to hear Marco say a more appropriate...

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,439
A little bit with a more Hispanic accent to it.

51
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,920
That's right.

52
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,640
So the second one we've got is guacamole.

53
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,599
Guacamole.

54
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,020
That's right.

55
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,879
We say guacamole, and this is from the avocado fruit.

56
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,800
That's right.

57
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,860
Avocados are green fruits.

58
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,800
They have a skin.

59
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,139
So you take the skin off and you usually mix guacamole with other ingredients.

60
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:22,599
Right.

61
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:22,639
That's right.

62
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,580
It has a little bit of lemon, onion, tomato.

63
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,539
Maybe a little spice.

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,599
Really good stuff.

65
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,979
So yeah, it comes from that fruit that you said, and it's kind of like a paste, right?

66
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,599
Yeah.

67
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:35,620
It's something that we often use as a dip.

68
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,159
So I can dip my potato chips or my tortilla chips in it, or I can use it as a sauce.

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:41,939
All right.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,539
Very good.

71
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:50,259
And our next and probably one of the most popular dishes in the Mexican cuisine world is a beef burrito.

72
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:51,180
Burrito.

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,180
So a burrito is another kind of wrap.

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,740
We have a tortilla, like you said earlier, and inside there are many different things.

75
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,860
So usually some rice and some beans and some meat, maybe beef or chicken.

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,780
That's right.

77
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,680
So consider it kind of like a sandwich, more or less.

78
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,780
But in a blanket instead of in bread.

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,520
Exactly.

80
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,300
In a blanket.

81
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,360
And then also we have cheese quesadillas.

82
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,060
Now also these are made from the same blanket of tortilla.

83
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,759
That's right.

84
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:35,340
So this thin tortilla, this flour tortilla, is put on top and on bottom, and inside you have some cheese, some melted cheese, or other times you can have cheese and chicken.

85
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,240
And usually you find it's a circle, but it's cut into four pieces, so it looks like pieces of a pie.

86
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:41,819
That's right.

87
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:50,620
And actually what you do is you heat it up in a pan so the cheese inside melts, and it's very, very delicious.

88
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:51,479
It is.

89
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,719
And sometimes you have this with a side of jalapeno.

90
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:55,659
Okay.

91
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,919
This is some type of vegetable, I would guess.

92
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,560
It's a pepper.

93
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,259
It's a pepper.

94
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:00,659
Right.

95
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,900
So this is a very, very spicy pepper that people often use to make things taste hot.

96
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,560
That's right.

97
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,680
So you can see them.

98
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,599
They're usually green, and they're very, very spicy.

99
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,580
So if you bite into one, it'll burn your mouth.

100
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,240
It will.

101
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,259
And sometimes people like to put these on our next dish.

102
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,399
What's the next dish, Marco?

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,939
We have some nachos.

104
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,420
Okay.

105
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,180
This is a classic Tex-Mex dish, like I was saying.

106
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,100
So a lot of Americans love to eat this.

107
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:33,639
And nachos are basically a plate of tortilla chips with what on top?

108
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:33,740
Yeah.

109
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,759
Usually it has melted cheese and maybe some chili, like we see in the dialogue.

110
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,600
So it will kind of just consider a plate full of these chips.

111
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,019
They look like potato chips, but they're made out of flour.

112
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:52,899
And on top, a lot of cheese and maybe some meat or some chili on top.

113
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,740
And Americans also like to put sour cream on top.

114
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,279
Oh, yes.

115
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,459
Sour cream is very popular on this dish.

116
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,759
So a lot of dishes.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,560
These are probably the most popular ones that you can find at most Mexican restaurants and also in Tex-Mex style cuisine.

118
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,759
So why don't we take another look at everything, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

119
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,319
Hello, sir.

120
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,860
Welcome to Pistolero Restaurant.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,939
May I take your order?

122
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,160
Yes.

123
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,879
I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

124
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,079
Sorry, sir.

125
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,339
But we ran out of chicken.

126
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,860
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

127
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,860
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

128
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,000
Sure.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,939
I'll have the burrito.

130
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,300
Do you have nachos?

131
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:40,600
Of course, sir.

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,839
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

133
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,019
Sounds good.

134
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,720
Would you like anything to drink?

135
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:46,740
Sure.

136
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,579
I'll have a Corona.

137
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:51,699
All right.

138
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,540
So Marco, today we have only three things to talk about, Influency Builder.

139
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,639
The first one is something that the waiter said to the customer.

140
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,519
It was to run out of.

141
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:01,139
That's right.

142
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,420
He wanted some chicken cheese enchiladas, but unfortunately, they ran out of chicken.

143
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,240
So the phrasal verb here is to run out of.

144
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:09,800
That's right.

145
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,139
And we heard the past tense.

146
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,560
So unfortunately, we ran out of chicken.

147
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:17,199
This means that we no longer have chicken.

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,819
We sold all of the chicken.

149
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,560
That's right.

150
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:26,519
So for example, if you're in your car and all of a sudden you run out of gasoline, it means your car will stop running.

151
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,339
That's a very bad situation.

152
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,819
So to run out of means to not have anymore.

153
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,579
That's right.

154
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,079
So you ran out of money.

155
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,360
Maybe you have no more money.

156
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,620
Ooh, another bad situation.

157
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,120
All right.

158
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,899
So instead, he ordered a burrito that included a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

159
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,379
Okay.

160
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:49,259
So the reason we included this is because it's important to remember this as a phrase, a side of.

161
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,759
That's right.

162
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,879
So this burrito comes with a side of guacamole or this burrito has a side of beans.

163
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,279
So a side of means a small portion, a little bit.

164
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:01,939
That's right.

165
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:09,600
The most important part of a side of is that it doesn't come in the dish or inside the burrito, let's say.

166
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,259
It just comes separately on a separate little plate.

167
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,459
Or it can come next to, yeah, next to the main dish.

168
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:23,240
So if the main dish is tacos, you can say, I want tacos with a side of black beans.

169
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,600
You would get the black beans in a little bowl next to you, but that's not the main thing.

170
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,459
Exactly.

171
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,120
Exactly.

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,839
So a side of.

173
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:37,019
Now for our last phrase, when we talked about the nachos, they came with melted cheese and chili.

174
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,939
So what do we mean by they come with melted cheese and chili?

175
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:41,399
Okay.

176
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:46,160
So this verb to come with means that they have as a part of the dish.

177
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:51,139
So this is not a side, not like before when we were talking about a side of.

178
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,220
This means that in the case of nachos, the nachos have on them on top cheese and chili.

179
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,079
That's right.

180
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:08,740
So sometimes if you go to McDonald's and you buy a meal, you get a burger and the burger comes with French fries and a Coke included in the meal.

181
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,759
Or you can say, unfortunately, this meal does not come with a drink, so you have to order the drink extra.

182
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,540
That's right.

183
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,600
Okay.

184
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,939
So a lot of great stuff.

185
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,319
Let's take another look and we'll be right back.

186
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,720
Hello, sir.

187
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:29,300
Welcome to pistol air restaurant.

188
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:30,379
May I take your order?

189
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,540
Yes.

190
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,259
I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

191
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,720
Sorry, sir, but we ran out of chicken.

192
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,259
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas, both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

193
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,399
Sure.

194
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,340
I'll have the burrito.

195
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:47,720
Do you have nachos?

196
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:48,980
Of course, sir.

197
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,259
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

198
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,419
Sounds good.

199
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,100
Would you like anything to drink?

200
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,139
Sure.

201
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:55,980
I'll have a Corona.

202
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,139
All right.

203
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,559
So Mexican food, very, very delicious.

204
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,539
And as we see, it has a lot of cheese in most dishes.

205
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,460
It does.

206
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,580
It has a lot of cheese and also a lot of tortillas.

207
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,360
So tortillas are these usually round, flat pancake like things.

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,419
They're not sweet.

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,360
They're savory.

210
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,879
And you usually put things in them like tacos or fajitas or burritos.

211
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:24,440
That's right.

212
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:25,799
And there's two kinds, right?

213
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,519
That's right.

214
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:35,100
So you have tortillas that are made from flour that are usually white, and then you have corn tortillas that are made from corn, and they're usually a little bit more yellow.

215
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,019
That's right.

216
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,919
So it's actually Mexican food is very, very good, but usually it's a little bit spicy.

217
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,559
So if you don't really like spicy food, you should tell the waiter or waitress to not make it spicy.

218
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,120
That's right.

219
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,980
If you don't eat spicy food, you certainly don't want to eat any jalapeno peppers.

220
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:53,659
That's right.

221
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm actually not really a fan of spicy food.

222
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,980
So for example, I really cannot eat jalapeno peppers.

223
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,240
See, I'm the opposite.

224
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,200
I love spicy food, so I often order green enchiladas, which have a spicy jalapeno green sauce.

225
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,860
Yeah, they're very, very spicy.

226
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:14,759
So this is part of our mini series that we have all about world foods.

227
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,720
We've already taken a look at Italian food.

228
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,860
We have Mexican food.

229
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,700
Next we'll be looking at Indian food, Korean food, a lot of great international foods coming up.

230
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,019
Yummy.

So let us know, do you like Mexican food?

232
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,000

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,799
And if we left off some kind of Mexican food like tacos, let us know.

234
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,440
That's right.
