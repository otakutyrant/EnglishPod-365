00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and Marco, I can tell you right now, I'm already hungry just thinking about our lesson today.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we have another food lesson.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Our world cuisine lesson for today is all about Mexican food.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Mexican food comes from the country Mexico, but also parts of the United States like Texas have something called Tex-Mex.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So you're going to hear a lot about these kinds of foods there.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's check out today's dialogue.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello, sir.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Welcome to Pistolero restaurant.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
May I take your order?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Sorry, sir, but we ran out of chicken.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sure.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll have the burrito.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Do you have nachos?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Of course, sir.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sounds good.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Would you like anything to drink?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sure.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll have a corona.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All right.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We're back.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So a lot of great dishes from Mexico.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's take a closer look at some of those on Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So first up, Marco, we have the word enchilada.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We have some chicken cheese enchilada.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So this dish has chicken and cheese, but an enchilada.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is that?

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So it's basically a wrap that is covered in cheese, right?

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's right.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So it has a base of a flour tortilla.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So a tortilla is like a wrap, as you said.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's consider it as flatbread.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Very thin.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Very thin.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And it rolls up and it's covered with cheese and inside it has chicken.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Very, very good.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And just a warning.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're going to hear me say the American pronunciation, enchilada, and you're going to hear Marco say a more appropriate...

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A little bit with a more Hispanic accent to it.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's right.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So the second one we've got is guacamole.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Guacamole.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We say guacamole, and this is from the avocado fruit.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Avocados are green fruits.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They have a skin.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So you take the skin off and you usually mix guacamole with other ingredients.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It has a little bit of lemon, onion, tomato.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Maybe a little spice.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Really good stuff.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So yeah, it comes from that fruit that you said, and it's kind of like a paste, right?

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's something that we often use as a dip.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So I can dip my potato chips or my tortilla chips in it, or I can use it as a sauce.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Very good.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And our next and probably one of the most popular dishes in the Mexican cuisine world is a beef burrito.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Burrito.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So a burrito is another kind of wrap.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We have a tortilla, like you said earlier, and inside there are many different things.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So usually some rice and some beans and some meat, maybe beef or chicken.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So consider it kind of like a sandwich, more or less.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But in a blanket instead of in bread.

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Exactly.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In a blanket.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And then also we have cheese quesadillas.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now also these are made from the same blanket of tortilla.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So this thin tortilla, this flour tortilla, is put on top and on bottom, and inside you have some cheese, some melted cheese, or other times you can have cheese and chicken.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And usually you find it's a circle, but it's cut into four pieces, so it looks like pieces of a pie.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And actually what you do is you heat it up in a pan so the cheese inside melts, and it's very, very delicious.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It is.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And sometimes you have this with a side of jalapeno.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is some type of vegetable, I would guess.

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's a pepper.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a pepper.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So this is a very, very spicy pepper that people often use to make things taste hot.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So you can see them.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They're usually green, and they're very, very spicy.

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So if you bite into one, it'll burn your mouth.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It will.

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And sometimes people like to put these on our next dish.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's the next dish, Marco?

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We have some nachos.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is a classic Tex-Mex dish, like I was saying.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So a lot of Americans love to eat this.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And nachos are basically a plate of tortilla chips with what on top?

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Usually it has melted cheese and maybe some chili, like we see in the dialogue.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So it will kind of just consider a plate full of these chips.

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
They look like potato chips, but they're made out of flour.

112
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And on top, a lot of cheese and maybe some meat or some chili on top.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And Americans also like to put sour cream on top.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, yes.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sour cream is very popular on this dish.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So a lot of dishes.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
These are probably the most popular ones that you can find at most Mexican restaurants and also in Tex-Mex style cuisine.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So why don't we take another look at everything, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hello, sir.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Welcome to Pistolero Restaurant.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
May I take your order?

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sorry, sir.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But we ran out of chicken.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas?

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sure.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll have the burrito.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you have nachos?

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Of course, sir.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Sounds good.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Would you like anything to drink?

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sure.

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll have a Corona.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
All right.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So Marco, today we have only three things to talk about, Influency Builder.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The first one is something that the waiter said to the customer.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It was to run out of.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's right.

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He wanted some chicken cheese enchiladas, but unfortunately, they ran out of chicken.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So the phrasal verb here is to run out of.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's right.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And we heard the past tense.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So unfortunately, we ran out of chicken.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This means that we no longer have chicken.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We sold all of the chicken.

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So for example, if you're in your car and all of a sudden you run out of gasoline, it means your car will stop running.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's a very bad situation.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So to run out of means to not have anymore.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So you ran out of money.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Maybe you have no more money.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ooh, another bad situation.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right.

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So instead, he ordered a burrito that included a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So the reason we included this is because it's important to remember this as a phrase, a side of.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's right.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So this burrito comes with a side of guacamole or this burrito has a side of beans.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So a side of means a small portion, a little bit.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's right.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The most important part of a side of is that it doesn't come in the dish or inside the burrito, let's say.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It just comes separately on a separate little plate.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Or it can come next to, yeah, next to the main dish.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So if the main dish is tacos, you can say, I want tacos with a side of black beans.

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You would get the black beans in a little bowl next to you, but that's not the main thing.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Exactly.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Exactly.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So a side of.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now for our last phrase, when we talked about the nachos, they came with melted cheese and chili.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So what do we mean by they come with melted cheese and chili?

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay.

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So this verb to come with means that they have as a part of the dish.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So this is not a side, not like before when we were talking about a side of.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This means that in the case of nachos, the nachos have on them on top cheese and chili.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So sometimes if you go to McDonald's and you buy a meal, you get a burger and the burger comes with French fries and a Coke included in the meal.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or you can say, unfortunately, this meal does not come with a drink, so you have to order the drink extra.

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's right.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay.

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So a lot of great stuff.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Let's take another look and we'll be right back.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hello, sir.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Welcome to pistol air restaurant.

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
May I take your order?

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes.

190
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Sorry, sir, but we ran out of chicken.

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas, both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sure.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll have the burrito.

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you have nachos?

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Of course, sir.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sounds good.

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Would you like anything to drink?

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sure.

201
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll have a Corona.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All right.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So Mexican food, very, very delicious.

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And as we see, it has a lot of cheese in most dishes.

205
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It does.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It has a lot of cheese and also a lot of tortillas.

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So tortillas are these usually round, flat pancake like things.

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They're not sweet.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They're savory.

210
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you usually put things in them like tacos or fajitas or burritos.

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And there's two kinds, right?

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's right.

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So you have tortillas that are made from flour that are usually white, and then you have corn tortillas that are made from corn, and they're usually a little bit more yellow.

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it's actually Mexican food is very, very good, but usually it's a little bit spicy.

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So if you don't really like spicy food, you should tell the waiter or waitress to not make it spicy.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If you don't eat spicy food, you certainly don't want to eat any jalapeno peppers.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's right.

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm actually not really a fan of spicy food.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So for example, I really cannot eat jalapeno peppers.

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
See, I'm the opposite.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I love spicy food, so I often order green enchiladas, which have a spicy jalapeno green sauce.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, they're very, very spicy.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So this is part of our mini series that we have all about world foods.

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We've already taken a look at Italian food.

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We have Mexican food.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Next we'll be looking at Indian food, Korean food, a lot of great international foods coming up.

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yummy.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So let us know, do you like Mexican food?

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And if we left off some kind of Mexican food like tacos, let us know.

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's right.
