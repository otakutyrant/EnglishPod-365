00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine, and what are we talking about today, Marco?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we are talking about a very interesting topic, most importantly among men, who are trying to get women's attention.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay, so these are some of the things that men might try to say if they are trying to find a girlfriend, or men, if you're out there, things that you might want to say, or not want to say in English.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right, that's right.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So why don't we just take a look at our dialogue, let's see what's going on, and we'll be back in a bit.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's go out tomorrow night.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines, you know, to break the ice.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Pick-up lines don't work.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Come on, you can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Come on, that's just lame.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No girl would fall for that.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Fine, then you can say, so there you are, I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's a good one.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think that's pretty funny.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit, and then you buy her a drink.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, how does this sound?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nice, let's go.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's explain what's going on a little bit more.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So the first word that we have here, Marco, is a verb, we say to approach, or to approach someone.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right, to approach someone, and that means to, you know, go up to someone and start a conversation, start talking to them.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right, so you physically walk towards someone, you go to them to start talking to them.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So you can say, I'm not good at approaching other people, or he approached her in the bar because he wanted to talk to her.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right, so to approach someone is to go up or get close to that person and start talking to them.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Alright, so now what the dialogue focuses on is pickup lines, as the title says, so what exactly are pickup lines?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Alright, well I'll take this as a phrase, you don't want to look at the individual words, but pickup lines are things that people say to show that they are interested romantically in other people.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So if I am talking to someone and maybe he says something that is a pickup line, he's trying to show that he's interested in me.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right, so usually I guess guys use pickup lines at bars or something to get a girl's attention and to, as you say, show that he is interested in her, right?

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right, and some are very creative and nice, and some are very stupid and silly.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So there are many different kinds of pickup lines, but the trick here is that they're usually lines that the person will create or will have heard before they use it.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right, exactly.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's like a fixed thing.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, it is usually very creative, as you say, or very funny to kind of get the girl's attention.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now, the first pickup line that we heard was, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All right, so what does he mean here?

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you were a booger, what is a booger?

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A booger is a piece of dirt in your nose.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, so sometimes you have some things in your nose and you want to blow your nose to clear it.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, those things inside your nose, those are called boogers.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is very informal English.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right, so I guess the technical term for it would be mucus.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mucus, that's right.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But obviously in English, there's also an informal way of calling it, and it's called a booger.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So the idea here is the pickup line means two things.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It means sometimes you have to take boogers out of your nose.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Some people use their finger, but the other meaning is, you know, if I'm interested in you, I pick you first.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Right, and the verb here, to pick, is not to choose, but is actually used as a verb when you're talking about your nose.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You pick your nose or you pick a booger.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That means to actually remove.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It means to put your finger in your nose to take out these pieces of dirt, these boogers.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right, so maybe a mom, a mother to their younger son or daughter would tell them, don't pick your nose in public.

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Moms often say this in English.

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't pick your nose.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's rude.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Exactly.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Alright, so it's a very interesting pickup line, obviously very funny and I guess creative, but at the same time, the verb there, to pick, we just figured out it means something completely different.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Alright, so it's a joke, but it's also kind of gross.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Exactly, and obviously his friend agrees and says that's lame.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lame, so something is lame if it's stupid or not funny.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We often say, that's a really lame joke, which means, I don't like that, I don't think it's funny.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, and actually people start using the word lame for many things that they don't like or they think is not interesting, right?

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah, like that band is so lame.

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Or that movie was lame.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It wasn't interesting, it wasn't fun.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, so that's basically what it means.

77
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Alright, so let's take a look at everything we've learned again, and we'll be back in a bit.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go out tomorrow night, we can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't think that's a good idea, I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Maybe you just need a few pickup lines, you know, to break the ice.

81
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Pickup lines don't work.

82
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Come on, you can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What?

84
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Come on, that's just lame.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No girl would fall for that.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Fine, then you can say, so there you are, I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's a good one.

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think that's pretty funny.

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit, and then you buy her a drink.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, how does this sound?

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

93
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Nice.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's go.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Alright, now let's take a look at some of these phrases on Fluency Builder.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay, so the first phrase we have here is something very, very common in business as well as in social situations.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We say, to break the ice.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And this is something that we heard when the two boys were talking about approaching a girl.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He said, I don't know how to break the ice.

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Right, so to break the ice is to make an awkward situation or something that's a little bit uncomfortable, a little bit more relaxed.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right, so oftentimes in a new company or at a party where you don't know anyone, you have to break the ice.

102
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You have to make things more comfortable so you can talk to people.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's right.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Alright, so you want to break the ice, you want to maybe be more comfortable around people.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Right, so sometimes people use games to break the ice.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Like at your company, maybe your first day of work, they'll have games to learn people's names.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
These are ways of breaking the ice.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Or at a party, you learn some pickup lines to break the ice with women.

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's right.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Alright, so we want to break the ice, we want to use some pickup lines.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And his friend argues that pickup lines are kind of lame.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And he even says no girl would fall for that line.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, to fall for something, this is a really important phrase and something that we say often in English.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now what exactly does it mean?

115
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're not falling on the ground.

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, no.

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It means you believe it or you consider it to be real.

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Alright, so when something is a lie or it's fake or it's not totally true, but someone believes it anyway, you say that that person, he fell for it.

119
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, so if I say, hey Marco, did you know tomorrow's a holiday?

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We don't have to work.

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, and I don't come to work?

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I say, ah, Marco fell for my trick.

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That means he believed it, but I was actually lying.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Exactly.

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Alright, so to fall for something means to believe it or to think it's true.

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, so no girl would fall for that means no girl would actually like you because you use these silly pickup lines.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Alright, so then he actually used another line.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He said, okay, so maybe you can use this other line.

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And his friend agreed, okay, that's a good one.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's a good one.

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You can also say, good one.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Good one.

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, this is very informal English and it's something that we say when we want to say that, you know, I like the idea or it's a good idea.

135
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Or maybe even a joke.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Someone tells a joke and you think it's really funny, you say, oh, that's a good one.

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's a good one.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So in this case, we heard one good pickup line and one bad one, but maybe you're at work and someone comes up with a really good idea for marketing.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You say, oh, that's a good one.

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's a good idea.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's a good one.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's right.

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright, and obviously his friend explains that the whole purpose of the pickup line is to make a fool of yourself a little bit and then, you know, buy the girl a drink or become her friend.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, to make a fool of yourself.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Now this is something that is probably not a good thing in most cases, right?

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A fool is someone who is silly, who no one takes seriously.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, someone who's not, yeah, not very serious.

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So to make a fool of yourself is to embarrass yourself a little bit.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, to look stupid in front of other people.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So I can say, oh, on my first day of work, I tripped and I fell on the ground and I made a fool of myself in front of my new colleagues.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So that's basically what it means to make a fool of yourself, to embarrass yourself, but you're doing it to yourself.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's not that someone else is embarrassing you.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You are embarrassing yourself.

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Alright, let's listen to this dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's go out tomorrow night.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines, you know, to break the ice.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Pick-up lines don't work.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Come on, you can just walk up to a girl and say, if you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Come on, that's just lame.

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No girl would fall for that.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Fine, then you can say, so there you are.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

170
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's a good one.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think that's pretty funny.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit, and then you buy her a drink.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, how does this sound?

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Nice.

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's go.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Alright, so looking at these pick-up lines, we took a look at the first one about the booger and everything.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What about the second one when you say, so there you are.

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So what is he saying here?

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What is implied?

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He's basically saying that he's met her before, and he's been looking for her.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So where did he meet her?

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He says he met her in his dreams, but now, oh, there she is.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was looking for you.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You, you're the woman of my dreams.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Right, so obviously the girl can feel a little bit confused at first because, oh, why were you looking for me?

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And then he says, oh, because you are the woman of my dreams.

190
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So it's obviously a little bit exaggerating, but it's funny.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He's joking, but he's basically saying, you know, I know you, I've been looking for you.

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And what about our last pick-up line where he was saying, I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

193
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So he's saying, you're so beautiful that I had this accident.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I walked into a wall.

196
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I hit my face.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Now that I have an injury, I need your information so that I can claim insurance, so I can get money from my insurance company.

198
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So this is a way to ask a woman for her phone number and name.

199
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And her name, exactly.

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So it's a very clever way of obviously breaking the ice.

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But at the same time, he's trying to be funny and trying to get her number, her telephone number and her name.

202
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's right.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So one of the most memorable ones that I've heard was, was your father a thief?

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because he stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes.

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Nice.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So this one is more of a compliment.

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, it's a compliment.

208
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But in a funny way, saying, oh, your dad stole all the stars from the sky.

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, no, I've heard a number of them.

210
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Most of them are pretty bad, pretty lame.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And they're always a way to almost always a way to ask for your phone number.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Now, as a girl, what do you think is better for a guy to use a clever, funny but tasteful pickup line or to just walk up to you and say, hi, my name is so-and-so, you know, what's your name?

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If you can be clever, if you can come up with something that's funny or interesting, then I think it's good.

214
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you say something that's rude or disgusting, I think that's probably bad.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Like the booger pickup line is a bad idea.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's an example of a bad pickup line.

217
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But, you know, if you can laugh about it, you don't say it seriously, but if you can laugh about it and say, hey, you know, is your daddy a thief?

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's something to start the conversation if you're laughing.

219
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Because sometimes it's very awkward if someone says, hey, I'm John, you know, what's your name?

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right.

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You don't really know how to react to that.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a little boring.

223
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And approaching someone like that way can be a little bit difficult.

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

225
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a very interesting thing.

226
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Let us know if you have any pickup lines, if you've heard any pickup lines or used any.

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We're really curious to know.

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah.

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We hope to see you guys there.

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
All right, guys.

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Bye.
