00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Let's go out tomorrow night.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't think that's a good idea.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines, you know, to break the ice.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Pick-up lines don't work.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Come on, you can just walk up to a girl and say, If you were a booger, I'd pick you first.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What?

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come on, that's just lame.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No girl would fall for that.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Fine, then you can say, So there you are.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've been looking all over for you, the woman of my dreams.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's a good one.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think that's pretty funny.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit, and then you buy her a drink.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, how does this sound?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So I'm going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Nice.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's go.
