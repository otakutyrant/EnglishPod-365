00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, guys.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about something that is a little bit private.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right, but very necessary to learn in English because it's very, very useful.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we're talking about clothing, more specifically underwear, so the clothes you wear under your clothes.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, so let's just jump into the dialogue.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's see what happens today, and we'll be back in a bit.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right, so a lot of great vocab there.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let's take a look at that now on Language Takeaway.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So the first thing we have here in Language Takeaway is actually very interesting, Marco, because we don't say one underwear or one boxers.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We say a pair of, just like pants, a pair of pants or a pair of underwear.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Pair of pants, a pair of shorts, of socks.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The same thing goes for underwear, so I really don't know why because it's one piece.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So are pants, but basically you have two holes, two places for your legs.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So anything with your legs, your socks, your shoes, your pants, your underwear, we say a pair because you've got the both sides, left and right.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right, so you've got a pair of men's boxers.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now before we describe the underwear part, let's take a look at this other machine, a laundry machine.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, so you know what a machine is.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's usually something that uses electricity to help us with a task or a job, but a laundry machine is special because it helps us clean our laundry.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What kind of things are laundry?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So anything that's your clothes.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So basically it's also called a washing machine, right?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So laundry machine or washing machine, same thing.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It uses water and soap to wash your clothes.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so now let's get into the type of underwear here, specifically for men usually.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We have boxers, boxer shorts.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So shorts means that they're not long, they're short, but boxers or boxer shorts as you say are usually pretty loose.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They're not very tight and they're longer than the other kinds of underwear we have.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay, so boxers are a type of underwear that men wear under their clothes and as you say they're pretty much shorts, but they're called boxers or you can call them boxer shorts.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now I guess the classic or the common form of men's underwear are called briefs.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Briefs.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now these are smaller than boxers and they're tighter, okay?

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And they are usually made out of some kind of material that stretches, you can pull them a little bit.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And this is again a smaller version, well a smaller kind of underwear.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So boxers are more like shorts.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Briefs are kind of, and briefs are not really shorts, they're more like a, I guess kind of like a swimming suit they look like.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, like a bathing suit bottom for men.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, that's it, right?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Undies.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, undies.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, so both these things we could actually describe as undies.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right, so undies is a common spoken language way of saying underwear, okay?

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So it's very casual and it's usually something that we say with our family or friends, especially moms like to say this with their kids.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Undies.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright honey, I'm going to buy you some new undies this week and of course as a child you feel very embarrassed, but undies is a way to say underwear.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, so that's all the vocab that we have for you on Language Takeaway, why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Lily, I found a pair of men's boxers in the laundry machine this morning.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's weird.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are they your boyfriends?

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nah, Kevin only wears briefs.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Plus, this pair is extra small.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do they look like?

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They're light blue with thin pink stripes.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, and there's a Snoopy on it, which is hilarious.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Those are my undies!

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some descriptive words in Fluency Builder.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Fluency Builder.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Alright, so as you said, Marco, we have a lot of great phrases today and some words for describing underwear, and you can describe other things with these words as well.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The first one we have is a phrase, extra small.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay, so when you buy underwear the size is, you sometimes get small, extra small, large, medium, but it's just a way of describing how big it is.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right, so you know the S, the M, and the L are small, medium, and large, but if you see the XS, that's extra small, it means it's very small.

73
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Alright, we also have XL, which is extra large.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, so now that we've described the size, now we're going to describe a little bit of how they look like, the colors, and maybe any characteristics.

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, the first thing that we see is the color is light blue.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, so we've got blue, which is normal blue, we have light blue, which is maybe the color of the sky on a beautiful summer day, there's also, we didn't hear it in today's dialogue, but there's another color, it's dark blue, which is almost more like purple or black.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's right.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So this is the way of describing a color, now it can be for any color except white, you don't really say light white or dark white.

80
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, you don't.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So you could say light green, dark green, light orange, dark orange.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, and now some characteristics.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They had some thin pink stripes, so we have the word here, thin.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So not fat, thin.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Uh-huh.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Pink, we have the color, but what are stripes?

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, stripes are a very common design for clothes, and you often see stripes, they're like lines, okay?

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And so that means that you have different lines that are pink.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You often see stripes on flags.

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So for example, the American flag has red and white stripes.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, very good.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So as you said, they're lines, and yeah, usually in clothing you can find maybe shirts.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They have vertical stripes, or sometimes even horizontal stripes.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, but these undies are quite unique, they're very special because they have pink stripes.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's right.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, so that's all the language we have for you, why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time, and we'll be back in a little bit.

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Lily, I found a pair of men's boxers in the laundry machine this morning.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's weird.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are they your boyfriends?

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nah, Kevin only wears briefs.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Plus, this pair is extra small.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What do they look like?

104
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They're light blue with thin pink stripes.

105
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, and there's a Snoopy on it, which is hilarious.

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Those are my undies!

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Alright, so in this case we're talking about men's boxer shorts because there was a confusion about the boyfriend, but women also wear boxer shorts, it's very popular now among women.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, it is, it's usually something that women wear over their underwear.

109
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Women don't really wear boxer shorts as underwear.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Women's underwear is smaller, it's like men's briefs, they're small.

111
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, so if a girl wears boxers, and it's usually for maybe if they're just around the house and you don't want to wear pants and you don't want to wear shorts, you can just wear a pair of comfortable boxer shorts.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Exactly, like they were pajamas.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Uh-huh, okay.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And actually I think a lot of girls also use boxer shorts as pajamas, right?

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They're comfortable and they're light and they're usually made from cotton, which is a nice material to sleep in.

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now when we're talking about briefs, there's also another way that I've heard that they're called sometimes, a more maybe funny way of calling them, some people say they're called tighty-whities.

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right, this is usually something we say to joke, because in America at least many men like to wear, young men like to wear boxers.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So they call briefs tighty-whities.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because usually their briefs are just white, they're plain, they don't have any design or any other color.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, they're plain and they're white usually, or gray, and they're tight, not like boxers.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So the casual name, this is not something you want to say to your English teacher, by the way.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The casual name or the funny name is tighty-whities.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Tighty-whities.

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And actually this is very interesting because with newer generations I think men are wearing boxers instead of briefs.

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Before I think the only option was briefs.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But now boxers have grown more and more popular and I think when you're a little kid your mom always buys you little briefs and everything, but then when you're a teenager I think you just switch over to boxers.

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's not as cool anymore to wear briefs.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yeah, I think it's the whole fact of how kids sometimes dress with saggy or baggy pants and so they like to show their boxers underneath for some reason.

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't really understand it, but if you do let us know.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We're going to have all the vocabulary and stuff on the website, so check it out.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright, we'll see you guys there.

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Bye.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Bye.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Bye.
