00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Catherine, and today we've got a great show for you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're talking all about music.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a great topic.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think everyone loves music, and well, there's so much type of music out there, so that's what we're going to be talking about today.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So there's a little bit for everyone here.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Even if you hate rock music, there might be something in it that you're going to be a fan of.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So before we get started on the dialogue, we have a couple of words that we want to preview, so let's take a look at them now in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alright, so this word sounds a little bit funny.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It looks like it should be pronounced differently.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We say genre.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Genre.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or genre.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It kind of sounds French.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Is it French?

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I think it comes from French.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a GE word, so genre.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's a soft, soft sound.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And what's a genre?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, a genre is like a category.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So you could say genre of book or genre of music.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Movies also have genres, right?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, they do.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's like horror movie is a genre.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, or action or suspense, etc.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So we're going to be looking at music genres on this occasion.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And some of these genre names actually have abbreviations.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They're long words that we say in short forms, and this kind of abbreviation is called an acronym.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright, so that's another word that we're looking at.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Acronym.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So an acronym is a short version of a long word.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, usually it's just letters.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Like USA is a very good acronym.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It means United States of America.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Alright, cool.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So there are some acronyms as well in music, so that's what we're going to be looking at.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And many other things.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I guess like DNA is an acronym.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, DNA is an acronym.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
UN is an acronym.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Alright, great.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Alright, so we're going to be looking at different genres of music.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're going to listen to a game show where people have to name the song and the genre.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Welcome back music lovers to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Team, let's get started.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Team A, guess this tune.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Uh, uh, Caring Your Love With Me by George Strait.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The genre is country music.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're right.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
100 points to Team A.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now for our next cut.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Song Song by Cisco.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I believe the genre is R&B.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
100 big points for Team B.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Superstar by the Carpenters.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And the genre?

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Um, um, Adult Contemporary?

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right, 100 points.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Uh-oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's hear our next song.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Too Easy.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are correct.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Very impressive, Team A.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it seems we have a tie.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Team A, are you ready?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ready.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's hear it.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hip-hop, classical, and gothic metal.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're right.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Team B, the pressure is on.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If you get all of them right, we will move on to Sudden Death.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you miss one, you lose.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
DJ, let's hear it.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Rap, disco, and...

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Fun show, Marco.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I kind of think I'd be good at this kind of game.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I might win big.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, there were a lot of different types of genres in there and a lot of different music.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't know, maybe not very popular, like for example, country music.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know if many people outside of the United States actually know about this.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, there might be different kinds of country music, but you know, in America, one of the most famous country music musicians is Garth Brooks, and even if I didn't like his music, I grew up hearing it everywhere.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But you don't like it?

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Um, you know, it's one of those things that I like some kinds of country music, but it's a huge genre.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That means there's lots of different kinds of music within country.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All right.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, let's take a look at more of these genres now in Language Takeaway.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Language Takeaway.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
All right, so we talked about country music.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, this is mostly in the United States, right?

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In the South, especially, because there's a long tradition of country music in the southern United States.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So it's very characteristic to have guitars and...

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A little bit of twang, maybe.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Twang?

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is twang?

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a way of saying a word.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So I could say, I'm from Texas, or I could say, I'm from Texas.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's twang.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's twang.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So kind of like an accent, a southern accent.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, so Garth Brooks has a famous twang, I got friends and love.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You know, that's a very famous song of his, where he's twangy.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Very southern.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All right, so we have country music, and then we saw another genre, which is R&B.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, this is a little bit more up my alley.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That means this is more of an interest of mine.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And R&B is an acronym for?

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Rhythm and blues.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right, so the R&B that we know now, what would be some examples of those artists?

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, a really famous artist is John Legend, who's been touring the world with his new album, and that kind of music is R&B.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So we're talking about a kind of music that mixes jazz traditions with rhythm.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So that means drums and bass.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's rhythm.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you have rhythm and blues, so like the name says, R&B, very popular nowadays.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And then we moved on to something heavier, something more like rock style, which is metal.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Metal, okay, I'm not really sure why they call it metal, but metal is a very, very popular kind of music.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So it divides into different categories, right?

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In this song, we saw that it was power metal, but you also have like heavy metal.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, because metal is such a broad category, it's a big category, it's hard to say what certain groups are unless you're really a fan and you follow, but there are many different kinds of metal out there.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And so if you're interested, I would check it out on Wikipedia.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, or let us know if you know what's the difference between power metal and gothic metal and electronic metal.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So there are so many different types now.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But moving on to our next genre, we also saw something that everyone probably knows nowadays, and that's hip hop.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, hip hop is a great, great and very interesting kind of music, grew out of a lot of people who are listening to jazz in the late 80s, especially in New York, I think, Brooklyn.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And it's kind of interesting in the sense that you take these old records, these old vinyls, and you slow everything down, right, right, so you change the speed.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So a normal song goes from dum, dum, dum, dum to dum, dum, dum, dum, and then you had like some bass in there.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, exactly.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And some lyrics, and you have yourself something like hip hop.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So a very famous hip hop artist nowadays would be 50 Cent, or for example, also Nelly, right, another famous hip hop artist.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So we have hip hop, and well, it's kind of similar, I don't know, very similar to rap almost.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, but it's different in that the way the process for making this kind of music is quite different.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, rap tends to be very lyric heavy, whereas hip hop is very beat heavy, I think.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So interesting.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, we've seen a lot of these different genres, but of course, there's so many more that we can't really look at all of them in one single podcast.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's what our website's for.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You can put your favorite music genres up on our website and practice your English.

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Exactly.

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So, well, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the second time?

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's get started.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Team A, guess this tune.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Uh, uh, Caring Your Love With Me by George Strait.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The genre is country music.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're right.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
100 points to Team A.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now for our next cut.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Song Song by Cisco.

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I believe the genre is R&B.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
100 big points for Team B.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Superstar by the Carpenters.

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And the genre?

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Um, um, Adult Contemporary?

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
100 points.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Uh oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's hear our next song.

173
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Too easy.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You are correct.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Very impressive, Team A.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And it seems we have a tie.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Team A, are you ready?

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Ready.

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's hear it.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hip-hop, classical and gothic metal.

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're right.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Team B, the pressure is on.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If you miss one, you lose.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
DJ, let's hear it.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Rap, disco, and, and...

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So it isn't a true EnglishPod lesson if we don't give you a couple of phrases and words to make you sound more fluent.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So that's the purpose of this next portion of our show.

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Fluency Builder.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, so the phrases that we're going to look at now on Fluency Builder are the ones that we saw in the dialogue, but we can use, of course, outside of music or outside of a game show.

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And there was an interesting one that he mentioned when he said double or nothing.

195
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Double or nothing.

196
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's double or nothing.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, this is an interesting phrase because it, I think, comes from gambling and betting.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yeah, so it's a way for us to say, well, you could double your money, but if you have a bad answer, if you lose this round, you don't get anything.

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So I guess, yeah, you do see a lot of people say maybe they're betting or they're playing a game.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That person loses and says, okay, let's go double or nothing.

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So give me one more shot to win back my money.

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if I say, okay, Marco, you need to tell me the capital of Brazil, you have $50.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you get the answer right, you get $100.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But if you get the answer wrong, you get zero.

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's double or nothing.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
All right.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Interesting phrase.

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What else do we have?

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We've got a great one here called tiebreaker.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So a tiebreaker.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, a tiebreaker.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's a thing.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And sometimes in games, some people have the same score.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They have the same amount of points.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So they're tied.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They're tied.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A tie means you have the same number.

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And if you want to win, you need one winner.

220
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have to have a tiebreaker to decide.

221
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So it could be a question or like we saw here, a tiebreaker round.

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

223
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So to decide on a winner.

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And this is all or nothing because if you get the answer right, you win.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you don't, you lose.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It doesn't matter if you were tied before.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
All right.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A tiebreaker.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And we have one more phrase and this one is really interesting.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The pressure is on.

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So if I say the pressure is on.

232
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It almost sounds painful.

233
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah, it does.

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Does it mean that I am being pressured or what is this?

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, it's a good question.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The important thing to look at here is the word on because pressure has this kind of companion word to put pressure on something or to put pressure on someone.

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And so it's the way we say it in English.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it means that you're going to really take things seriously from this point on.

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
OK.

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Right.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So for example, the Chicago Bulls were at the peak, the height of their fame, and they were just a wonderful team.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And oftentimes you'd hear the announcer say, there's five seconds left on the clock.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The pressure is on Michael Jordan to win the game.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
All right.

245
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So the opportunity for the team to win all depended on Michael Jordan.

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Right.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So the pressure, all of this stuff is on him, his shoulders.

248
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So he has to score the point to win the game.

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,000
OK.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This is a very interesting phrase.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use the pressure is on.

252
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Example one.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Carl is really stressed out lately.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The pressure of the entire project is on him since his promotion.

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Example two.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The pressure is on the president to guide his country out of the recession.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Example three.

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The pressure is on our entire team to successfully come up with a new product for the Asian market within a month.

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
All right.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Great examples.

261
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Great phrases.

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think it's pretty clear now.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It is.

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And to make sure that we understood the whole dialogue, I think we should take another listen to it at a normal speed.

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And when we come back, we're talking a little bit more about one of my favorite topics, music.

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's get started.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Team A, guess this tune.

269
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm carrying your love with me.

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Carrying your love with me by George Strait.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The genre is country music.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're right.

273
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
One hundred points to Team A.

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Now for our next cut.

275
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All night long, let me see that song.

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Song song by Cisco.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I believe the genre is R&B.

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
One hundred big points for Team B.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's just the radio.

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Superstar by the Carpenters.

283
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And the genre?

284
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Um, um, adult contemporary?

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's right.

286
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
One hundred points.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Uh oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

288
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let's hear our next song.

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Too easy.

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

292
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You are correct.

293
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Very impressive Team A.

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And it seems we have a tie.

295
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Team A, are you ready?

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Ready.

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let's hear it.

300
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hip hop, classical and gothic metal.

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're right.

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Team B, the pressure is on.

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you miss one, you lose.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
DJ, let's hear it.

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Rap, disco and, and.

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
All right, so we have music, different music genres.

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Which one are you mostly into?

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
As a hard question.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I have very different interests.

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I like classical music.

312
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I also like jazz, but I also like rock and I also like R&B.

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
So I guess it depends on your mood.

314
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Absolutely.

315
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Now they say that music does really influence people's moods.

316
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
They did a study.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Some, some doctors in America did a study to see if heart patients, people who have heart problems could be positively affected by music.

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And the results said that yes, it can be helpful.

319
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh really?

320
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Okay.

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
So maybe it helps them relax or.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah.

323
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It says if you're listening to the radio and you're a song that you like comes on the radio, you hear this song, your heart pumps more oxygen to your brain.

324
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So it means it actually makes you happier.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What about when they play music for unborn babies?

326
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Like they'll put little headphones on a mother's belly and they'll play like classical music because supposedly it'll make the baby smarter.

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Baby Mozart or something.

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, exactly.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What do you think about that?

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't know.

331
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I think talking to kids and giving them books when they're little probably helps a little bit more, but I'm not a doctor.

332
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So that I can't say.

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, many people do argue now that they don't make music like they used to.

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I guess they say that, you know, music that was made before the lyrics were more profound.

335
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
They were real musicians.

336
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They were composers and they wrote lyrics.

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
But now you just get a lot of temporary music that doesn't really transcend into the future.

338
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What do you think?

339
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I totally disagree.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I think the last 10 years have seen a really amazing growth in the music industry because more people are communicating, you know, the Internet allows us to hear all sorts of things from all over the world.

341
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And so we have great musicians who can listen to music from Mali and they can listen to music from India and they have all these different influences that were not there before.

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And so I think it's the opposite.

343
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I think a lot of new pathways in music have opened up because of the technology evolution.

344
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Wow, interesting.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000

Do you think maybe music has become better in the last decade or do you think maybe it's not so good?

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well, you do have bad artists, right?

349
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You always have bad artists.

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yeah, the bad ones, they fade into history.

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
