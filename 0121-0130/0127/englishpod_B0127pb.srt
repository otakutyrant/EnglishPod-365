00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,080
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,799
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,859
And my name is Catherine, and today we've got a great show for you.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,880
We're talking all about music.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,580
It's a great topic.

6
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:18,440
I think everyone loves music, and well, there's so much type of music out there, so that's what we're going to be talking about today.

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:19,199
Exactly.

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:21,620
So there's a little bit for everyone here.

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,120
Even if you hate rock music, there might be something in it that you're going to be a fan of.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:27,780
Right.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:36,119
So before we get started on the dialogue, we have a couple of words that we want to preview, so let's take a look at them now in Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,240
Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,600
Alright, so this word sounds a little bit funny.

14
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,820
It looks like it should be pronounced differently.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,100
We say genre.

16
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:45,060
Genre.

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:45,979
Or genre.

18
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,179
It kind of sounds French.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,740
Is it French?

20
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,640
I think it comes from French.

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,960
It's a GE word, so genre.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,500
It's a soft, soft sound.

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
And what's a genre?

24
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,859
Well, a genre is like a category.

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,560
So you could say genre of book or genre of music.

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,459
Movies also have genres, right?

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Yeah, they do.

28
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,159
It's like horror movie is a genre.

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,640
Okay, or action or suspense, etc.

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,019
So we're going to be looking at music genres on this occasion.

31
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,560
And some of these genre names actually have abbreviations.

32
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,620
They're long words that we say in short forms, and this kind of abbreviation is called an acronym.

33
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,640
Alright, so that's another word that we're looking at.

34
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,200
Acronym.

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,579
So an acronym is a short version of a long word.

36
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,599
Yeah, usually it's just letters.

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,480
Like USA is a very good acronym.

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,019
It means United States of America.

39
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,200
Alright, cool.

40
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,620
So there are some acronyms as well in music, so that's what we're going to be looking at.

41
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,540
And many other things.

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,099
I guess like DNA is an acronym.

43
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,500
Yeah, DNA is an acronym.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,459
UN is an acronym.

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,459
Alright, great.

46
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:54,739
Alright, so we're going to be looking at different genres of music.

47
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,519
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,260
We're going to listen to a game show where people have to name the song and the genre.

49
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,680
Welcome back music lovers to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

50
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,699
Team, let's get started.

51
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:23,680
Team A, guess this tune.

52
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,400
Uh, uh, Caring Your Love With Me by George Strait.

53
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,280
The genre is country music.

54
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,520
You're right.

55
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,419
100 points to Team A.

56
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,780
Now for our next cut.

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,620
Song Song by Cisco.

58
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,120
I believe the genre is R&B.

59
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,659
100 big points for Team B.

60
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,280
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

61
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,199
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

62
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,800
Superstar by the Carpenters.

63
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,340
And the genre?

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,580
Um, um, Adult Contemporary?

65
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,919
That's right, 100 points.

66
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,020
Uh-oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

67
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,900
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

68
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,800
Let's hear our next song.

69
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:32,879
Too Easy.

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,919
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,539
You are correct.

72
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,379
Very impressive, Team A.

73
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,379
And it seems we have a tie.

74
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,020
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

75
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,860
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

76
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,280
Team A, are you ready?

77
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,159
Ready.

78
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,039
Let's hear it.

79
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,840
Hip-hop, classical, and gothic metal.

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
You're right.

81
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,180
Team B, the pressure is on.

82
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,259
If you get all of them right, we will move on to Sudden Death.

83
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,160
If you miss one, you lose.

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,420
DJ, let's hear it.

85
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,480
Rap, disco, and...

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,680
Fun show, Marco.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,540
I kind of think I'd be good at this kind of game.

88
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,879
I might win big.

89
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,660
Well, there were a lot of different types of genres in there and a lot of different music.

90
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,800
I don't know, maybe not very popular, like for example, country music.

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,699
I don't know if many people outside of the United States actually know about this.

92
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, there might be different kinds of country music, but you know, in America, one of the most famous country music musicians is Garth Brooks, and even if I didn't like his music, I grew up hearing it everywhere.

93
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,000
But you don't like it?

94
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,480
Um, you know, it's one of those things that I like some kinds of country music, but it's a huge genre.

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,959
That means there's lots of different kinds of music within country.

96
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,639
All right.

97
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:36,399
Well, let's take a look at more of these genres now in Language Takeaway.

98
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,220
Language Takeaway.

99
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,660
All right, so we talked about country music.

100
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,480
Now, this is mostly in the United States, right?

101
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,639
In the South, especially, because there's a long tradition of country music in the southern United States.

102
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,880
So it's very characteristic to have guitars and...

103
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,740
A little bit of twang, maybe.

104
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,300
Twang?

105
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,540
What is twang?

106
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,079
It's a way of saying a word.

107
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,879
So I could say, I'm from Texas, or I could say, I'm from Texas.

108
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,079
That's twang.

109
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,079
That's twang.

110
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,839
So kind of like an accent, a southern accent.

111
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,639
Yeah, so Garth Brooks has a famous twang, I got friends and love.

112
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,899
You know, that's a very famous song of his, where he's twangy.

113
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,720
Very southern.

114
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,240
Yeah.

115
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,379
All right, so we have country music, and then we saw another genre, which is R&B.

116
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,839
Okay, this is a little bit more up my alley.

117
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,480
That means this is more of an interest of mine.

118
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,519
And R&B is an acronym for?

119
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,540
Rhythm and blues.

120
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,480
All right, so the R&B that we know now, what would be some examples of those artists?

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:48,639
Well, a really famous artist is John Legend, who's been touring the world with his new album, and that kind of music is R&B.

122
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,019
So we're talking about a kind of music that mixes jazz traditions with rhythm.

123
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:56,319
So that means drums and bass.

124
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,079
That's rhythm.

125
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:04,560
So you have rhythm and blues, so like the name says, R&B, very popular nowadays.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,759
And then we moved on to something heavier, something more like rock style, which is metal.

127
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,699
Metal, okay, I'm not really sure why they call it metal, but metal is a very, very popular kind of music.

128
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:19,360
So it divides into different categories, right?

129
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,779
In this song, we saw that it was power metal, but you also have like heavy metal.

130
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:35,720
Well, because metal is such a broad category, it's a big category, it's hard to say what certain groups are unless you're really a fan and you follow, but there are many different kinds of metal out there.

131
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,100
And so if you're interested, I would check it out on Wikipedia.

132
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, or let us know if you know what's the difference between power metal and gothic metal and electronic metal.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,439
So there are so many different types now.

134
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:54,319
But moving on to our next genre, we also saw something that everyone probably knows nowadays, and that's hip hop.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah, hip hop is a great, great and very interesting kind of music, grew out of a lot of people who are listening to jazz in the late 80s, especially in New York, I think, Brooklyn.

136
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:15,259
And it's kind of interesting in the sense that you take these old records, these old vinyls, and you slow everything down, right, right, so you change the speed.

137
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:22,720
So a normal song goes from dum, dum, dum, dum to dum, dum, dum, dum, and then you had like some bass in there.

138
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:23,620
Yeah, exactly.

139
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,720
And some lyrics, and you have yourself something like hip hop.

140
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:35,779
So a very famous hip hop artist nowadays would be 50 Cent, or for example, also Nelly, right, another famous hip hop artist.

141
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,879
So we have hip hop, and well, it's kind of similar, I don't know, very similar to rap almost.

142
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,740
Yeah, but it's different in that the way the process for making this kind of music is quite different.

143
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,320
Yeah, rap tends to be very lyric heavy, whereas hip hop is very beat heavy, I think.

144
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,059
Right.

145
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,220
So interesting.

146
00:08:53,399 --> 00:09:01,519
Now, we've seen a lot of these different genres, but of course, there's so many more that we can't really look at all of them in one single podcast.

147
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,759
That's what our website's for.

148
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,940
You can put your favorite music genres up on our website and practice your English.

149
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,200
Exactly.

150
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,779
So, well, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the second time?

151
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:16,200
Let's slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

152
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:27,500
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

153
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:28,559
Let's get started.

154
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,539
Team A, guess this tune.

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,220
Uh, uh, Caring Your Love With Me by George Strait.

156
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:37,080
The genre is country music.

157
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,360
You're right.

158
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,240
100 points to Team A.

159
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,559
Now for our next cut.

160
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,820
Song Song by Cisco.

161
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,320
I believe the genre is R&B.

162
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,879
100 big points for Team B.

163
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,500
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

164
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,360
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

165
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,679
Superstar by the Carpenters.

166
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,259
And the genre?

167
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,460
Um, um, Adult Contemporary?

168
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,700
That's right.

169
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,779
100 points.

170
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,080
Uh oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

171
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,940
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

172
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,940
Let's hear our next song.

173
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:18,519
Too easy.

174
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,580
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

175
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,200
You are correct.

176
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,039
Very impressive, Team A.

177
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,039
And it seems we have a tie.

178
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,700
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

179
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,600
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

180
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,039
Team A, are you ready?

181
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:38,919
Ready.

182
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,620
Let's hear it.

183
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,500
Hip-hop, classical and gothic metal.

184
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,639
You're right.

185
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,820
Team B, the pressure is on.

186
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,940
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

187
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,840
If you miss one, you lose.

188
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,000
DJ, let's hear it.

189
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,600
Rap, disco, and, and...

190
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,539
So it isn't a true EnglishPod lesson if we don't give you a couple of phrases and words to make you sound more fluent.

191
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,320
So that's the purpose of this next portion of our show.

192
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,220
Fluency Builder.

193
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:22,179
Okay, so the phrases that we're going to look at now on Fluency Builder are the ones that we saw in the dialogue, but we can use, of course, outside of music or outside of a game show.

194
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,000
And there was an interesting one that he mentioned when he said double or nothing.

195
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,539
Double or nothing.

196
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,580
It's double or nothing.

197
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,299
Well, this is an interesting phrase because it, I think, comes from gambling and betting.

198
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:44,820
Yeah, so it's a way for us to say, well, you could double your money, but if you have a bad answer, if you lose this round, you don't get anything.

199
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:50,279
So I guess, yeah, you do see a lot of people say maybe they're betting or they're playing a game.

200
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,440
That person loses and says, okay, let's go double or nothing.

201
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
So give me one more shot to win back my money.

202
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:56,419
Right.

203
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,940
So if I say, okay, Marco, you need to tell me the capital of Brazil, you have $50.

204
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,440
If you get the answer right, you get $100.

205
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,019
But if you get the answer wrong, you get zero.

206
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,899
That's double or nothing.

207
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:09,840
All right.

208
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,860
Interesting phrase.

209
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
What else do we have?

210
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,340
We've got a great one here called tiebreaker.

211
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,779
So a tiebreaker.

212
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,659
Yeah, a tiebreaker.

213
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,279
It's a thing.

214
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:22,899
And sometimes in games, some people have the same score.

215
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,539
They have the same amount of points.

216
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,240
So they're tied.

217
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,159
They're tied.

218
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,360
A tie means you have the same number.

219
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,179
And if you want to win, you need one winner.

220
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,480
You have to have a tiebreaker to decide.

221
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,960
So it could be a question or like we saw here, a tiebreaker round.

222
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:37,340
Yeah.

223
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,960
So to decide on a winner.

224
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,860
And this is all or nothing because if you get the answer right, you win.

225
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,179
If you don't, you lose.

226
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,279
It doesn't matter if you were tied before.

227
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,639
All right.

228
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,639
A tiebreaker.

229
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,759
And we have one more phrase and this one is really interesting.

230
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,720
The pressure is on.

231
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,559
So if I say the pressure is on.

232
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,519
It almost sounds painful.

233
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,360
Yeah, it does.

234
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,759
Does it mean that I am being pressured or what is this?

235
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,720
Well, it's a good question.

236
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:17,440
The important thing to look at here is the word on because pressure has this kind of companion word to put pressure on something or to put pressure on someone.

237
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,700
And so it's the way we say it in English.

238
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:25,960
And it means that you're going to really take things seriously from this point on.

239
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,360
OK.

240
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:26,720
Right.

241
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:34,580
So for example, the Chicago Bulls were at the peak, the height of their fame, and they were just a wonderful team.

242
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:40,000
And oftentimes you'd hear the announcer say, there's five seconds left on the clock.

243
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,200
The pressure is on Michael Jordan to win the game.

244
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:43,799
All right.

245
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,159
So the opportunity for the team to win all depended on Michael Jordan.

246
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:48,419
Right.

247
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,740
So the pressure, all of this stuff is on him, his shoulders.

248
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,860
So he has to score the point to win the game.

249
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,399
OK.

250
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,620
This is a very interesting phrase.

251
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,539
Why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use the pressure is on.

252
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,860
Example one.

253
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,240
Carl is really stressed out lately.

254
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,360
The pressure of the entire project is on him since his promotion.

255
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:15,059
Example two.

256
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,580
The pressure is on the president to guide his country out of the recession.

257
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:23,720
Example three.

258
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,820
The pressure is on our entire team to successfully come up with a new product for the Asian market within a month.

259
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,059
All right.

260
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:34,879
Great examples.

261
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,720
Great phrases.

262
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:37,220
I think it's pretty clear now.

263
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:38,179
It is.

264
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,500
And to make sure that we understood the whole dialogue, I think we should take another listen to it at a normal speed.

265
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,059
And when we come back, we're talking a little bit more about one of my favorite topics, music.

266
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,019
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

267
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,080
Let's get started.

268
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,039
Team A, guess this tune.

269
00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:14,139
I'm carrying your love with me.

270
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,759
Carrying your love with me by George Strait.

271
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,659
The genre is country music.

272
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,899
You're right.

273
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,779
One hundred points to Team A.

274
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,240
Now for our next cut.

275
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,399
All night long, let me see that song.

276
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,980
Song song by Cisco.

277
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,460
I believe the genre is R&B.

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,080
One hundred big points for Team B.

279
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,720
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

280
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,200
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

281
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,039
It's just the radio.

282
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,159
Superstar by the Carpenters.

283
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,700
And the genre?

284
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,980
Um, um, adult contemporary?

285
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,179
That's right.

286
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,279
One hundred points.

287
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,399
Uh oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

288
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,279
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

289
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,139
Let's hear our next song.

290
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Too easy.

291
00:16:17,539 --> 00:16:21,299
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

292
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,899
You are correct.

293
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,740
Very impressive Team A.

294
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,779
And it seems we have a tie.

295
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,399
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

296
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,200
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

297
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,620
Team A, are you ready?

298
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:37,519
Ready.

299
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,139
Let's hear it.

300
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,220
Hip hop, classical and gothic metal.

301
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,379
You're right.

302
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,539
Team B, the pressure is on.

303
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,679
If you get all of them right, we will move on to sudden death.

304
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,559
If you miss one, you lose.

305
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,440
DJ, let's hear it.

306
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,059
Rap, disco and, and.

307
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,140
All right, so we have music, different music genres.

308
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,400
Which one are you mostly into?

309
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,240
As a hard question.

310
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,500
I have very different interests.

311
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,000
I like classical music.

312
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,799
I also like jazz, but I also like rock and I also like R&B.

313
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,359
So I guess it depends on your mood.

314
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:53,119
Absolutely.

315
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,400
Now they say that music does really influence people's moods.

316
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,240
They did a study.

317
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:06,900
Some, some doctors in America did a study to see if heart patients, people who have heart problems could be positively affected by music.

318
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,220
And the results said that yes, it can be helpful.

319
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,019
Oh really?

320
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:11,059
Okay.

321
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,140
So maybe it helps them relax or.

322
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:13,460
Yeah.

323
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:24,819
It says if you're listening to the radio and you're a song that you like comes on the radio, you hear this song, your heart pumps more oxygen to your brain.

324
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,000
So it means it actually makes you happier.

325
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,180
What about when they play music for unborn babies?

326
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,920
Like they'll put little headphones on a mother's belly and they'll play like classical music because supposedly it'll make the baby smarter.

327
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,359
Baby Mozart or something.

328
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, exactly.

329
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,140
What do you think about that?

330
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,339
I don't know.

331
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:49,519
I think talking to kids and giving them books when they're little probably helps a little bit more, but I'm not a doctor.

332
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,359
So that I can't say.

333
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,420
Well, many people do argue now that they don't make music like they used to.

334
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,079
I guess they say that, you know, music that was made before the lyrics were more profound.

335
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,500
They were real musicians.

336
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,660
They were composers and they wrote lyrics.

337
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:11,180
But now you just get a lot of temporary music that doesn't really transcend into the future.

338
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:11,640
What do you think?

339
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,160
I totally disagree.

340
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:24,420
I think the last 10 years have seen a really amazing growth in the music industry because more people are communicating, you know, the Internet allows us to hear all sorts of things from all over the world.

341
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:34,359
And so we have great musicians who can listen to music from Mali and they can listen to music from India and they have all these different influences that were not there before.

342
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,279
And so I think it's the opposite.

343
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:40,900
I think a lot of new pathways in music have opened up because of the technology evolution.

344
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:41,720
Wow, interesting.

345
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,519

348
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,779
Well, you do have bad artists, right?

349
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,740
You always have bad artists.

350
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,119
Yeah, the bad ones, they fade into history.

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,319
