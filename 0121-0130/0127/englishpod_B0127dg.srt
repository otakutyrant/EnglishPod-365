00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:17,140
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,179
Let's get started.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,120
Team A, guess this tune.

5
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,960
Carrying Your Love With Me by George Strait.

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,859
The genre is country music.

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,039
You're right.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,880
100 points to Team A.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,399
Now for our next cut.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,100
Song Song by Cisco.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,560
I believe the genre is R&B.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,179
100 big points for Team B.

13
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,880
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

14
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,299
Superstar by the Carpenters.

16
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,859
And the genre?

17
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,040
Adult Contemporary.

18
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,299
That's right.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,439
100 points.

20
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,540
Uh oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

21
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,379
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

22
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,299
Let's hear our next song.

23
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:29,359
Too Easy.

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,420
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

25
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,000
You are correct.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,879
Very impressive, Team A.

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,879
And it seems we have a tie.

28
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,500
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,359
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

30
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,760
Team A, are you ready?

31
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:49,640
Ready.

32
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:51,500
Let's hear it.

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,340
Hip Hop, classical and gothic metal.

34
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:08,500
You're right.

35
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:10,680
Team B, the pressure is on.

36
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,759
If you get all of them right, we will move on to Sudden Death.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,639
If you miss one, you lose.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,879
DJ, let's hear it.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,240
Rap, disco and and...
