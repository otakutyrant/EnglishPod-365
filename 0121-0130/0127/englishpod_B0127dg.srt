00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Welcome back, music lovers, to I Love That Song, the game show where we test your musical knowledge to the extreme.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's get started.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Team A, guess this tune.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Carrying Your Love With Me by George Strait.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The genre is country music.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're right.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
100 points to Team A.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now for our next cut.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Song Song by Cisco.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I believe the genre is R&B.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
100 big points for Team B.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For all of our viewers, the acronym R&B stands for rhythm and blues.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On that note, DJ, play our next song.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Superstar by the Carpenters.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And the genre?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Adult Contemporary.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
100 points.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Uh oh, that sound means it's double or nothing.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The songs are more difficult and the points are doubled.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's hear our next song.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Too Easy.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That song is Kingslayer by the Finnish power metal group Nightwish.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are correct.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Very impressive, Team A.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And it seems we have a tie.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's time now for the tiebreaker round.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Each team will be played three songs and they must tell us the genre of each song in less than five seconds.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Team A, are you ready?

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ready.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's hear it.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hip Hop, classical and gothic metal.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're right.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Team B, the pressure is on.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you get all of them right, we will move on to Sudden Death.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you miss one, you lose.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
DJ, let's hear it.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Rap, disco and and...
