00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've been hired to build a deck on this here house and turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There is one catch though.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We've only got one day to finish this, so I'm going to need everyone to give 110% today.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here and I know that together we can tackle this project.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That being said, let's get to work.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, remember, we've been over the plans, but we really need to make sure that everything is up to code.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough, so please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb, measure twice, cut once.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay guys, let's get at it.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Bob, pass me that hammer.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The nails won't go in.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The wood is too hard.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That did it.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, do me a favor and help me cut this two by four, will ya?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Pass me that circle saw and grab hold of the end of the board.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now help me drill some holes in it so we can place the bolts.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I think you should sand the edges.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Look at all these splinters.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Someone could get hurt.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Geez, you gotta take pride in your work.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, you're right.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Julia, get over here with that level, measuring tape, and that box of screws.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh no!

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Look out below!
