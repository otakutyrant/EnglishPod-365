00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome back to another great lesson at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name's Erica.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be building something.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've got a lesson about construction.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Cool.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we're going to be working at a construction site today and we're going to learn a lot of cool vocabulary with different types of tools.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And we'll also learn some phrases that you can use to talk about work.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So even if you're not really interested in building and making stuff with your hands, you will learn some language to talk about work in general.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All right.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So before we get started with this construction dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, Marco, we're going to look at two words now.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And like you said, we're building something in this lesson, right?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're going to be building a deck.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
A deck?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A deck.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All right.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So a deck.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is that?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Basically it's an elevated wooden platform that houses will have like in their backyards maybe.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So it's a platform that's a little bit higher off the ground behind your house.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So it's very popular for houses to have decks and people will put out a table and chairs and maybe have lunch out there or a barbecue or something.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So a deck.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now they're building this deck and they need to follow some plans.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Plans.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Plans.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The plans that we're talking about are construction plans.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's kind of like the map for the deck, how you're going to build it.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Exactly.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we can have floor plans, for example.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So that shows you how the building looks like where the different rooms are.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Like a house, right?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So it's basically the map for a construction.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, great.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So two interesting words.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We're going to hear both of these in the dialogue.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now why don't we get started and find out what's going to happen as they're building this deck.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've been hired to build a deck on this here house and turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There is one catch though.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We've only got one day to finish this.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I'm going to need everyone to give 110% today.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here and I know that together we can tackle this project.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That being said, let's get to work.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now remember, we've been over the plans, but we really need to make sure that everything is up to code.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough, so please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb, measure twice, cut once.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay guys, let's get at it.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Bob, pass me that hammer.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The nails won't go in.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The wood is too hard.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That did it.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey, do me a favor and help me cut this two by four, will ya?

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Pass me that circle saw and grab hold of the end of the board.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now help me drill some holes in it so we can place the bolts.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think you should sand the edges.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Look at all these splinters.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Someone could get hurt.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Jeez, you've got to take pride in your work.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, you're right.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Julia, get over here with that level, measuring tape, and that box of screws.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh no, look out below!

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
All right, so there are a lot of people building the deck.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They have to build it fast.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
They've only got one day.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So it's a really big challenge, huh?

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, and I think this is a good lesson in maybe not rushing through important projects, right?

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Exactly.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So we saw some really interesting tools that they were using.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So why don't we look at that first in Language Takeaway?

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Language Takeaway.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right, so we've got some language all about tools.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So why don't we just get started?

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So they mentioned a nail gun.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Nail gun.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A nail gun.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So we all know about hammers and nails, right?

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Right, so the nails are what you put in the wood.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Exactly.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now this is an advanced tool so you don't have to use a hammer.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's kind of hard to explain, so why don't we listen to the sound this tool makes?

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, I guess like its name suggests, it's a gun for putting nails in wood.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, it actually uses compressed air to push nails really fast into the wood.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
All right.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All right, so they are nailing some pieces of wood together, but they also needed to cut the wood, and they said, help me cut the two by four.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, she said help me cut this two by four.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So a two by four.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is a very popular type of wood that you use in construction.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A two by four is basically two inches by four inches.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So two inches high and four inches wide.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So it's the most popular and common type of wood that you would use for construction, a two by four.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You'll hear it all the time.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So they're going to cut the two by four, and she said, pass me the circular saw.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A circular saw.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A circular saw.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So a saw, we understand, is something you use to cut wood, but you have many types of saws.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You have a band saw, you have a circular saw, and this one makes this sound.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I guess it's called a circular saw because the blade or the cutting part is shaped in a circle.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, a circular saw.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So after they cut the piece of wood, one of the guys said, I think you should sand the edges.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To sand something.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
To sand something.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Alright, so if you want to sand usually a piece of wood, you want to use paper covered in sand to make it very smooth.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, exactly.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so they also mentioned a sander, right?

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
A sander is basically a machine that has this sandpaper on it and will do the hard work for you.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Alright, so to sand something and a sander.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now our next word is very related to sanding something, because if you don't sand a piece of wood, it might have splinters.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Splinters.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Splinter.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Splinters.

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So like I said, if you cut a piece of wood, there are little pieces of wood that stick out and you can get hurt, they can get under your skin.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, so tiny, tiny parts of wood.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's called a splinter.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A splinter.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, so why don't we go on to our next tool, and we're talking about a level.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
A level.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The level.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Alright, so this is a tool that all carpenters have, and it's basically a tool that has a little bit of water in it, right?

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, and it helps you make sure that everything is straight and flat.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Exactly, so that's a level every carpenter has it, and also a measuring tape.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
A measuring tape.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Measuring tape.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now I'm sure if this was a video podcast, we could show you what a measuring tape was and you'd really understand it, but we'll do our best to describe it for you.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So a measuring tape is like a ruler that rolls up.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, it's a very convenient ruler because it can roll up and you can measure something that is maybe 6 feet or 3 meters long, and you can extend it, and when you're done measuring, you can put it back and just put it in your pocket.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, every carpenter has one.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A measuring tape.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Alright, so that's our last tool that we're going to talk about, so why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder where we've got some phrases that you can use to talk about work.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Fluency Builder.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So when the contractor started giving them instructions, he said, I need everyone to give 110% today.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
To give 110%.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So when you give 110%, you are basically trying very hard.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah, you give everything you have to your job.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So it's not only 100%, it's 110, more than what's needed.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So no lunch break.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Exactly.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So as they were talking about the instructions, one of the guys said, the carpenter's rule of thumb.

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A rule of thumb.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So this is an interesting phrase, rule of thumb.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What does that mean exactly?

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, well, you know what, I think we can understand the meaning pretty clearly if we listen to some examples.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Example one.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The rule of thumb in making a sale is confidence.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Without confidence, you don't make a sale.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Example two.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The tailor's rule of thumb is twice the circumference of the wrist is the circumference of the neck.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Example three.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You don't have to take everything I say about marketing as a rule of thumb.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
One of the guys noticed a few problems, you know, the splinters, and he said, you've got to take pride in your work.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, so to take pride in your work.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
To take pride in your work.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why did he say that to her?

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What is he trying to tell her?

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, because she made some mistakes, she didn't do such a good job, he's wanting her to work harder, work better, work more carefully.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, and so she can be proud of her work and say, this is a job well done.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So when you take pride in your work, you work so well and do such a good job that you feel really happy about it.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
All right, good.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk about construction.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've been hired to build a deck on this here house and turn this boring and drab lawn into a backyard oasis.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There is one catch though.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We've only got one day to finish this.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So I'm going to need everyone to give 110% today.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's going to be tough, but we've got a great team here and I know that together we can tackle this project.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That being said, let's get to work.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now remember, we've been over the plans, but we really need to make sure that everything is up to code.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The home inspectors here are pretty thorough, so please make sure you follow the plans exactly.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And remember the carpenter's rule of thumb, measure twice, cut once.

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay, guys, let's get at it.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Bob, pass me that hammer.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The nails won't go in.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The wood is too hard.

185
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I think I'm going to need the nail gun.

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That did it.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey, do me a favor and help me cut this two by four, will ya?

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Pass me that circle saw and grab hold of the end of the board.

189
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Now help me drill some holes in it so we can place the bolts.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I think you should sand the edges.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Look at all these splinters.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Someone could get hurt.

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Jeez, you've got to take pride in your work.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Pass me the sander and I'll take care of it.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Julia, get over here with that level, measuring tape, and that box of screws.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh no, look out below!

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So an interesting aspect of North American culture is projects like this, right?

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Building a deck or maybe adding a room to your house.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, that's right.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And we call this DIY.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Right, DIY.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do it yourself.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So it's a very popular summer project, right?

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So if you live in a neighborhood in North America, you might see the dad of a family outside building something and all his friends come over and they drink beer and build this big thing together.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So it could be a tree house, it could be a deck, it could even maybe be adding another room to the house.

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, and you know, it's actually so popular that there are tons of TV shows about how to build stuff for your house and there are a lot of really big stores where you can go and find all of this equipment for building stuff for your house.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Right.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So basically there are these big stores where you can get anything from paint to wood to tools, a huge amount of material so you can do it yourself.

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can DIY.

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today but let us know what you think and tell us if you are into doing handiwork like this, like maybe building a tree house or building a deck.

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's right, you can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
As well you can also leave your questions there.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Alright, so we'll see you guys there and until next time.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thanks for listening and goodbye!

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Bye!
