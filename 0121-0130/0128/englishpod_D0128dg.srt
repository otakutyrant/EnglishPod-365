00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:17,000
EnglishPod.com Steven good to see you brother.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How are you?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
How was your trip?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It was fine.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've missed you all.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How's mom?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
She's great.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're her pride and joy.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You know that right?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't wait to see her.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What's new with you?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You'll have another nephew or niece soon.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's great!

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wow!

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Congrats!

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You two are great together you know.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You have such a beautiful family.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I hope that one day I can have that.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Of course man!

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Come on!

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I mean everything was said here for you to marry Shalini.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You know she's still pining after you.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I hardly knew her.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How could she be in love with me?

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I couldn't go through with it even though she's a great woman.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, I left my heart in the United States.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I just hope Veronica is happy.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Get over it.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're home now.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can marry anyone you want.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't want to marry anyone.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to marry her.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't you understand?

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are incorrigible.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Steven!

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
My baby!

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How are you?

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I miss you so much.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hey mom.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Great to see you.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You look so thin!

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Didn't those Americans feed you?

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Come, come.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's have some time.

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hi Steven.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Veronica?

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How did you get here?

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How do you know where I live?

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I waited for you at the airport but you never showed.

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about but we can discuss that later.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I realized that I was just scared.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm here now.

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now there's something I want to ask you.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Steven, will you marry me?

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I now declare you husband and wife.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You may kiss the bride.
