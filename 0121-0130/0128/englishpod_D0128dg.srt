00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:17,480
EnglishPod.com Steven good to see you brother.

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:18,160
How are you?

3
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,160
How was your trip?

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,280
It was fine.

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,920
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

6
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:23,899
I've missed you all.

7
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:24,719
How's mom?

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:25,640
She's great.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,000
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,219
You're her pride and joy.

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:32,079
You know that right?

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,020
I can't wait to see her.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:34,820
You?

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:35,899
What's new with you?

15
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,539
Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,179
You'll have another nephew or niece soon.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,740
That's great!

18
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,380
Wow!

19
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:44,619
Congrats!

20
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,420
You two are great together you know.

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,000
You have such a beautiful family.

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,179
I hope that one day I can have that.

23
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,299
Of course man!

24
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:51,939
Come on!

25
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,840
I mean everything was said here for you to marry Shalini.

26
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,060
You know she's still pining after you.

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,820
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,299
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,359
I hardly knew her.

30
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,799
How could she be in love with me?

31
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,400
I couldn't go through with it even though she's a great woman.

32
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,939
No, I left my heart in the United States.

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,180
I just hope Veronica is happy.

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,620
Get over it.

35
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,760
You're home now.

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,079
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

37
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,340
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

38
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,879
You can marry anyone you want.

39
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,659
I don't want to marry anyone.

40
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:23,219
I want to marry her.

41
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,319
Don't you understand?

42
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:26,579
You are incorrigible.

43
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:35,079
Steven!

44
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:39,780
My baby!

45
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,780
How are you?

46
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,500
I miss you so much.

47
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,099
Hey mom.

48
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,140
Great to see you.

49
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,359
You look so thin!

50
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,319
Didn't those Americans feed you?

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,319
Come, come.

52
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,560
Let's have some time.

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,379
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

54
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,159
Hi Steven.

55
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,540
Veronica?

56
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,939
How did you get here?

57
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,819
How do you know where I live?

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,959
I waited for you at the airport but you never showed.

59
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,939
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about but we can discuss that later.

60
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,639
I realized that I was just scared.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,780
Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

62
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,199
I'm here now.

63
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,599
Now there's something I want to ask you.

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Steven, will you marry me?

65
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,080
I now declare you husband and wife.

66
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,360
You may kiss the bride.
