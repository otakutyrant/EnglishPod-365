00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today Marco and I get to share with you the thrilling conclusion to the, well, very popular, I must say, series.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Very popular.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I love you.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is the finale, the final episode, episode 10.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is where it all ends.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So what do you think is going to happen?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If I guess, you're just going to get angry at me because I actually know how it ends.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But let's just say I hope that it ends well for our protagonists.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There was a lot of controversy around it because, you know, I wanted to know if people wanted a happy ending, a sad ending, unexpected.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I guess everyone wants a happy ending, right?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Absolutely.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So we're going to, well, keep our fingers crossed for Steven and Veronica and check out this dialogue one time.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Steven, good to see you, brother.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How was your trip?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It was fine.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've missed you all.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How's mom?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
She's great.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're her pride and joy.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You know that, right?

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Can't wait to see her.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What's new with you?

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You'll have another nephew or niece soon.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's great.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Wow.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Congrats.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You two are great together, you know.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You have such a beautiful family.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I hope that one day I can have that.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Of course, man.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come on.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I mean, everything was said here for you to marry Shalini.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You know, she's still pining after you.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you talking about?

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I hardly knew her.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How could she be in love with me?

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I couldn't go through with it, even though she's a great woman.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I left my heart in the United States.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I just hope Veronica is happy.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Get over it.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're home now.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You can marry anyone you want.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't want to marry anyone.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want to marry her.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't you understand?

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You are incorrigible.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Steven!

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
My baby!

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How are you?

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I miss you so much.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hey, Mom.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Great to see you.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You look so thin.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Didn't those Americans feed you?

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Come, come.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's have some time.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hi, Steven.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Veronica.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How did you get here?

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How do you know where I live?

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I realized that I was just scared.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm here now.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now, there's something I want to ask you.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Steven, will you marry me?

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I now declare you husband and wife.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You may kiss the bride.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All right, so they got married.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You got married.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We got married.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I got married.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wow, I should have called my mom.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Not only did you get married, but you got married Bollywood style with music and everything nice.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Those weddings are like four days long.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I hope you enjoyed the finale of this story.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Absolutely.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was glad to see that it was a happy ending.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have to say, if it had been a sad ending, I would have been a little bit disappointed because, well, Veronica and I...

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You get along.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We get along.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Apart from this happy ending and this happy finale that we had, we did look at a lot of great words and phrases.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why don't we start now with language takeaway?

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Language takeaway.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The first couple of phrases I want to talk about here have to do with maybe catching up and talking about family or gossip because we're talking to Steven's Indian family who he hasn't seen for a long, long time.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The first thing, he's talking to his brother about his brother and his wife.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Gulam and Nisha are expecting, we find out.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right, they're expecting.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If Gulam and Nisha are expecting, what does that mean exactly?

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They're expecting a letter.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Expecting a baby, maybe?

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Aha, yeah.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Here we go.

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm expecting is a very common English way of saying, I'm going to have a baby.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm pregnant.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
All right.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't get this confused.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If somebody says, oh, well, I'm expecting, you don't have to say expecting what?

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Exactly.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When it's only expecting, when it's not a thing afterwards, I'm expecting means I'm pregnant or she's expecting.

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She's going to have a baby.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
They're expecting a baby or they're expecting.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They were talking about, Steven, he was supposed to get married in India.

121
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
His brother said a very interesting, where he said, well, these girls are still, this girl is still pining over you.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The Shalini, some girl that Steven used to know when he was living in India, she's pining after you.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, pine has many different meanings in English.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In this sense, we're talking about having a crush on or being in love with.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And also it's a way of saying that you are, that you desire, you yearn for this person very, very much, but that you don't have them.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Right.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You want them, you want them.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So you're pining over this person.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Now, can you pine over an object?

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, no.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Usually it's maybe related to love or to a person, right?

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So she, she stands by the door every day waiting, the letter that doesn't come, she's pining away for her dear love Thomas or whatever.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And you know what I read recently is that people can get addicted to pining.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Really?

136
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
After a breakup, maybe you can pine after a person, not because you miss them or you want to, but you kind of grow accustomed to it and you become addicted to this pain.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's kind of pleasurable.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is a way to describe this.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's called Petrarchan love.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, it's this kind of traditional idea in poetry where you have a love that's never consummated.

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's never filled.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You never get to be with the person that you love, that you desire.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And so it's a way, yeah, it's a way of distinguishing the two different kinds of love.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
One where you're with the person and the other, where you always want them, but you can never have them.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, hopefully none of our listeners are pining over anyone or get to experience that, huh?

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Exactly.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But if you do pine away or you pine after someone, you have to hope that one day you'll get over that person.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have to get over it.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And that's what his brother says.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hey, get over it.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So what does it mean when you're supposed to get over someone?

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is a good question because, you know, we're talking here not about actually getting up on top of a fence or a wall.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We're talking about emotions.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So getting over someone.

159
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So I have to get over him means that I have to stop feeling so sad about what happened.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because usually you say this when someone's sad or angry.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And also it kind of means that you have to forget or let that person go, you know, like get over it.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're going to move on here to the last word in today's language takeaway, which is incorrigible.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
An incorrigible person.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All right, incorrigible.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What could this mean?

168
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, let's look at the sentence where we find it.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You are incorrigible.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Gulam says this to Stephen.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So it's an adjective and basically it means that you have no correction of some sort.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
There's an argument between Stephen and Gulam.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So they're brothers and Stephen says, I don't want to get married.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't want to marry her.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He's complaining.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And his brother says, you are incorrigible.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You just won't stop.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Right.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So someone's feelings, their emotions, their ideas about something, they just can't be changed or altered.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They're fixed.

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You know, this guy, he's like, I'm not going to get married.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And his brother says, you're incorrigible.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I just can't change your mind.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's kind of like being stubborn.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And we hear this phrase a lot together.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So you're incorrigible.

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Right.

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So this is often just kind of a, it's not an insult, but it's a way for us to kind of be sarcastic or to make fun of someone.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're incorrigible, Marco.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Usually you say it when you're loud, you know, you're being nice.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
All right.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, cool.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So five great words in language takeaway today.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And well, before we move on and listen to the dialogue again, why don't we take a look at fluency builder.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Fluency builder.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All right.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This first phrase is something that parents often use and grandparents as well, because obviously parents and grandparents, they're very proud of their children, their grandchildren.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So they describe something as being their pride and joy.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
My pride and joy.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So it's usually a person that's your pride and joy.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It could be a thing too.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It could be a thing.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
His Porsche Boxster is his pride and joy.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He goes out every morning and he washes it.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He changes the oil.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He checks the gas.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He checks the tires.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it's his pride and joy.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
All right.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's his most valued possession.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So it always goes together, right?

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My pride and joy.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Pride and joy.

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Just think of it as a phrase, pride and joy.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
All right.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So I'm my mother's pride and joy.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think you are.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right.

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So somebody's pride and joy.

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So now another phrase that we took a look at, and it's a way of making conversation, especially with a person that you haven't seen in a while.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He said, hey, what's new with you?

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's new with you?

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's new with you?

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
All right.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So this might sound a little strange because normally we say, how have you been?

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's been a long time.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How are you?

231
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But this is like, you know, it's a fluency builder phrase.

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So it's very colloquial, very spoken language.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So this you hear often between friends or family members.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey, Marco, what's new with you?

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So how do you, I would answer this by saying, oh, well, not much.

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Or I just bought a new house.

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So basically you're asking for news from a person.

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I haven't seen you in a long time.

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You look, you look happy and healthy.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So what's new with you?

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, I got married.

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I got a new car.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
These things that you can say, these are changes in my life.

244
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
All right.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And usually after somebody asks you, what's new with you?

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You say something and then you usually would follow up and ask that person as well.

247
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Right.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What's new and what's new with you?

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Exactly.

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So, you know, I got a new house, got a new job.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's new with you?

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Or what about you?

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What about you?

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So it's a nice, very relaxed, informal way of asking someone for news in their life.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Perfect.

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All right.

258
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What's new with you?

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Uh, what else now?

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He was supposed to get married, right?

261
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Right.

262
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So this is news.

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He was supposed to get married.

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He didn't get married.

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What's going on?

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
His brother, his mother, they all want to know what's going on.

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And we find out that wedding, that girl, he just couldn't go through with it.

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I can't, I couldn't go through with it.

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This past tense.

271
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So he's saying before I came to India with this girl, I couldn't go through with it.

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So present would be, I can't go through with it.

273
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And going through with what here?

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We've got it.

275
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So this kind of magical, strange word, it what it, what could this be?

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So basically what he's saying is that he couldn't complete or maybe finish something that he started, right?

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So in this case, we're talking about a relationship or marriage, a relationship.

278
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So maybe we loved each other, but I couldn't go through with it.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I couldn't go to the finish line.

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Right.

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I couldn't get married.

282
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You see that a lot when maybe in movies, two people are supposed to get married.

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They're at the altar.

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And all of a sudden the bride says, I can't, or she goes away crying.

285
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can't go through with this.

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So because she loves somebody else.

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So can't go through with it.

288
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Great.

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So really good phrase.

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can't go through with it.

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He couldn't go through with it.

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And we find out that, well, not such a bad thing, Steven.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's very popular in India.

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The girls love him.

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We've got a great phrase for describing having lots of girls who love you.

296
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Right.

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He says there'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Literally like, wow.

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I can't imagine that.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Like just somebody throwing themselves.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No, it's not literal.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's basically saying girls are very interested in you.

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Girls are so interested in you that they'll be chasing you almost.

304
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All right.

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So many, many girls, they will, they will follow you.

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They'll want to be in a relationship with you.

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They like you.

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So he's saying, listen, there are other girls.

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't worry.

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Girls here, they love you.

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And it doesn't only work with girls, right?

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can say there'll be boys throwing themselves at you.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Right.

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So this is, uh, this is something we say about both genders, boys and girls.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You could say, Oh God, all the boys were throwing themselves at her.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm so jealous.

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right.

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So, but it's only basically in a loving way, right?

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It can't be anything else.

320
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like somebody's chasing you for other reasons.

321
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No, this is saying that they have crushes.

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They have feelings.

323
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
They want to be romantic.

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not like a, it's not a bad thing, but sometimes it's too much attention, so it can be kind of negative.

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah.

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All right.

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, interesting phrases on Fluency Builder today.

328
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time.

329
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Get up and dance.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Steven, good to see you, brother.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How are you?

332
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How was your trip?

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It was fine.

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I've missed you all.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,000
How's mom?

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She's great.

338
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

339
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're her pride and joy.

340
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know that, right?

341
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't wait to see you.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You?

343
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's new with you?

344
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, Nisha and I are expecting you'll have another nephew or niece soon.

345
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's great.

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Wow.

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Congrats.

348
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You two are great together.

349
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You know, you have such a beautiful family.

350
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I hope that one day I can have that.

351
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Of course, man.

352
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Come on.

353
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini.

354
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You know, she's still pining after you.

355
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What are you talking about?

357
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I hardly knew her.

358
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How could she be in love with me?

359
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I can go through it even though she's a great woman.

360
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No, I left my heart in the United States.

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I just hope Veronica is happy.

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Get over it.

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're home now.

364
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

365
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

366
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You can marry anyone you want.

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't want to marry anyone.

368
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I want to marry her.

369
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Don't you understand?

370
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You are incredible.

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Steven, my baby.

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How are you?

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I miss you so much.

374
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, Mom.

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Great to see you.

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You look so thin.

377
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Didn't those Americans feed you?

378
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Come, come.

379
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's have some time.

380
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

381
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hi, Steven.

382
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Veronica, how did you get here?

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How do you know where I live?

384
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

385
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

386
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I realized that I was just scared, scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

387
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm here now.

388
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Now, there's something I want to ask you.

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Steven, will you marry me?

390
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I now declare you husband and wife.

391
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You may kiss the bride.

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
All right, so it's over.

393
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ah, sad, sad but sweet.

394
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Sad but sweet, huh?

395
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, we went from them meeting casually by a bike accident.

396
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, we had nice music.

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Then it turned out that she was angry.

398
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
They kind of broke up.

399
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
They got back together.

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He was being strained with all of these secret trips to save people.

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It was interesting.

402
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We went a lot of different ways.

403
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
She was pregnant.

404
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
She wasn't really pregnant.

405
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The doctor was stalking her.

406
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He's in the secret service.

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It was an interesting ride.

408
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Very interesting.

409
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, now we need to think of a new drama, a new soap opera or novel.

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So we need your input.

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Maybe we should open it up.

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What did you like?

413
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What didn't you like and what kind of genre are you interested in?

414
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Because, you know, there's tons of different kinds of stories we could tell.

415
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Right, maybe we can do something scary like a thriller or horror.

416
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm a big fan of sci-fi.

417
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Or sci-fi.

418
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe we can do something sci-fi.

419
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Maybe we can do a comedy, something maybe like Friends.

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know.

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That'd be kind of cute.

422
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, it could be.

423
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
All right, so listeners, why don't you give us your input?

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We need your feedback.

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Tell us what series you would like next.

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What type of series?

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Maybe like we said drama, sci-fi, action.

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What would you like?

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
