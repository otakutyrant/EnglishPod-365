00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,040
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:05,580
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,799
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:14,980
And today Marco and I get to share with you the thrilling conclusion to the, well, very popular, I must say, series.

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,179
Very popular.

7
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:15,939
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,379
I love you.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,019
That's right.

10
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,820
Today is the finale, the final episode, episode 10.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,339
This is where it all ends.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,280
So what do you think is going to happen?

13
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,699
If I guess, you're just going to get angry at me because I actually know how it ends.

14
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,340
But let's just say I hope that it ends well for our protagonists.

15
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:39,359
There was a lot of controversy around it because, you know, I wanted to know if people wanted a happy ending, a sad ending, unexpected.

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,020
I guess everyone wants a happy ending, right?

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,820
Absolutely.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,960
So we're going to, well, keep our fingers crossed for Steven and Veronica and check out this dialogue one time.

19
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,980
Steven, good to see you, brother.

20
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:07,640
How are you?

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,659
How was your trip?

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,760
It was fine.

23
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,400
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,319
I've missed you all.

25
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:14,200
How's mom?

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,140
She's great.

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,519
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

28
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:20,700
You're her pride and joy.

29
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,540
You know that, right?

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,519
Can't wait to see her.

31
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,299
You?

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,400
What's new with you?

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,040
Well, Nisha and I are expecting.

34
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,719
You'll have another nephew or niece soon.

35
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,219
That's great.

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:32,879
Wow.

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,120
Congrats.

38
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:35,900
You two are great together, you know.

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,500
You have such a beautiful family.

40
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,680
I hope that one day I can have that.

41
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:40,799
Of course, man.

42
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,439
Come on.

43
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,319
I mean, everything was said here for you to marry Shalini.

44
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,540
You know, she's still pining after you.

45
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,299
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,799
What are you talking about?

47
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,859
I hardly knew her.

48
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,299
How could she be in love with me?

49
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,900
I couldn't go through with it, even though she's a great woman.

50
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,439
No, I left my heart in the United States.

51
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,700
I just hope Veronica is happy.

52
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,099
Get over it.

53
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,219
You're home now.

54
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,579
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

55
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,819
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,379
You can marry anyone you want.

57
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,180
I don't want to marry anyone.

58
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,680
I want to marry her.

59
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't you understand?

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,919
You are incorrigible.

61
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:28,259
Steven!

62
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,280
My baby!

63
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,280
How are you?

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,979
I miss you so much.

65
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,580
Hey, Mom.

66
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:33,639
Great to see you.

67
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,840
You look so thin.

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,780
Didn't those Americans feed you?

69
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,800
Come, come.

70
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,060
Let's have some time.

71
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,900
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

72
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,659
Hi, Steven.

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,020
Veronica.

74
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,419
How did you get here?

75
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,340
How do you know where I live?

76
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,460
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,400
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

78
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,120
I realized that I was just scared.

79
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,300
Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

80
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm here now.

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,039
Now, there's something I want to ask you.

82
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,120
Steven, will you marry me?

83
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:31,580
I now declare you husband and wife.

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,860
You may kiss the bride.

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,659
All right, so they got married.

86
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:42,860
You got married.

87
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,800
We got married.

88
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,000
I got married.

89
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:47,419
Wow, I should have called my mom.

90
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,319
Not only did you get married, but you got married Bollywood style with music and everything nice.

91
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,819
Those weddings are like four days long.

92
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,900
I hope you enjoyed the finale of this story.

93
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,500
Absolutely.

94
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,219
I was glad to see that it was a happy ending.

95
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,539
I have to say, if it had been a sad ending, I would have been a little bit disappointed because, well, Veronica and I...

96
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:11,139
You get along.

97
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:11,879
We get along.

98
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:12,419
All right.

99
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,199
Apart from this happy ending and this happy finale that we had, we did look at a lot of great words and phrases.

100
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,600
Why don't we start now with language takeaway?

101
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,540
Language takeaway.

102
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:39,399
The first couple of phrases I want to talk about here have to do with maybe catching up and talking about family or gossip because we're talking to Steven's Indian family who he hasn't seen for a long, long time.

103
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,819
The first thing, he's talking to his brother about his brother and his wife.

104
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,399
Gulam and Nisha are expecting, we find out.

105
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,879
Right, they're expecting.

106
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,160
If Gulam and Nisha are expecting, what does that mean exactly?

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,839
They're expecting a letter.

108
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,720
Expecting a baby, maybe?

109
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:57,560
Aha, yeah.

110
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,500
Here we go.

111
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,199
I'm expecting is a very common English way of saying, I'm going to have a baby.

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm pregnant.

113
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,019
All right.

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,620
Don't get this confused.

115
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,100
If somebody says, oh, well, I'm expecting, you don't have to say expecting what?

116
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,879
Exactly.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,060
When it's only expecting, when it's not a thing afterwards, I'm expecting means I'm pregnant or she's expecting.

118
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,439
She's going to have a baby.

119
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:22,120
They're expecting a baby or they're expecting.

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,379
They were talking about, Steven, he was supposed to get married in India.

121
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,680
His brother said a very interesting, where he said, well, these girls are still, this girl is still pining over you.

122
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:41,300
The Shalini, some girl that Steven used to know when he was living in India, she's pining after you.

123
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:44,740
Well, pine has many different meanings in English.

124
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,040
In this sense, we're talking about having a crush on or being in love with.

125
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,819
And also it's a way of saying that you are, that you desire, you yearn for this person very, very much, but that you don't have them.

126
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:57,220
Right.

127
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,000
You want them, you want them.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,160
So you're pining over this person.

129
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,819
Now, can you pine over an object?

130
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,639
No, no.

131
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,740
Usually it's maybe related to love or to a person, right?

132
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,199
Yeah.

133
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:17,819
So she, she stands by the door every day waiting, the letter that doesn't come, she's pining away for her dear love Thomas or whatever.

134
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,519
And you know what I read recently is that people can get addicted to pining.

135
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:23,319
Really?

136
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,699
Yeah.

137
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:32,720
After a breakup, maybe you can pine after a person, not because you miss them or you want to, but you kind of grow accustomed to it and you become addicted to this pain.

138
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:33,720
That's kind of pleasurable.

139
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
There is a way to describe this.

140
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,740
It's called Petrarchan love.

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,180
Well, it's this kind of traditional idea in poetry where you have a love that's never consummated.

142
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,959
That's never filled.

143
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,920
You never get to be with the person that you love, that you desire.

144
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,540
And so it's a way, yeah, it's a way of distinguishing the two different kinds of love.

145
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,579
One where you're with the person and the other, where you always want them, but you can never have them.

146
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,500
Well, hopefully none of our listeners are pining over anyone or get to experience that, huh?

147
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:04,579
Exactly.

148
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:13,279
But if you do pine away or you pine after someone, you have to hope that one day you'll get over that person.

149
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:13,740
Yeah.

150
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,259
You have to get over it.

151
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,500
And that's what his brother says.

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,660
Hey, get over it.

153
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,360
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

154
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,500
So what does it mean when you're supposed to get over someone?

155
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,439
Okay.

156
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:30,360
This is a good question because, you know, we're talking here not about actually getting up on top of a fence or a wall.

157
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,060
We're talking about emotions.

158
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,740
So getting over someone.

159
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:41,139
So I have to get over him means that I have to stop feeling so sad about what happened.

160
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:41,600
Right.

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,399
Because usually you say this when someone's sad or angry.

162
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:49,980
And also it kind of means that you have to forget or let that person go, you know, like get over it.

163
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,579
We're going to move on here to the last word in today's language takeaway, which is incorrigible.

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:55,620
Okay.

165
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,500
An incorrigible person.

166
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,720
All right, incorrigible.

167
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,860
What could this mean?

168
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,160
Well, let's look at the sentence where we find it.

169
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,259
You are incorrigible.

170
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,339
Gulam says this to Stephen.

171
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:07,819
Right.

172
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,899
So it's an adjective and basically it means that you have no correction of some sort.

173
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,379
There's an argument between Stephen and Gulam.

174
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,139
So they're brothers and Stephen says, I don't want to get married.

175
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,199
I don't want to marry her.

176
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,480
He's complaining.

177
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,300
And his brother says, you are incorrigible.

178
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,480
You just won't stop.

179
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:25,139
Right.

180
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,600
So someone's feelings, their emotions, their ideas about something, they just can't be changed or altered.

181
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,320
They're fixed.

182
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,080
You know, this guy, he's like, I'm not going to get married.

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,299
And his brother says, you're incorrigible.

184
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,740
I just can't change your mind.

185
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,860
It's kind of like being stubborn.

186
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,220
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

187
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,100
And we hear this phrase a lot together.

188
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,659
So you're incorrigible.

189
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,240
Right.

190
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,700
So this is often just kind of a, it's not an insult, but it's a way for us to kind of be sarcastic or to make fun of someone.

191
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
You're incorrigible, Marco.

192
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,419
Usually you say it when you're loud, you know, you're being nice.

193
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,019
All right.

194
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Okay, cool.

195
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,940
So five great words in language takeaway today.

196
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:09,080
And well, before we move on and listen to the dialogue again, why don't we take a look at fluency builder.

197
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,320
Fluency builder.

198
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,460
All right.

199
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:20,500
This first phrase is something that parents often use and grandparents as well, because obviously parents and grandparents, they're very proud of their children, their grandchildren.

200
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,700
So they describe something as being their pride and joy.

201
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:26,240
My pride and joy.

202
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,379
So it's usually a person that's your pride and joy.

203
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,299
It could be a thing too.

204
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:31,139
It could be a thing.

205
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,740
His Porsche Boxster is his pride and joy.

206
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,960
He goes out every morning and he washes it.

207
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,279
He changes the oil.

208
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
He checks the gas.

209
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,919
He checks the tires.

210
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,399
So it's his pride and joy.

211
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,059
All right.

212
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,080
It's his most valued possession.

213
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,759
So it always goes together, right?

214
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,779
My pride and joy.

215
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,539
Pride and joy.

216
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:47,919
Yeah.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,919
Just think of it as a phrase, pride and joy.

218
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:50,480
All right.

219
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,360
So I'm my mother's pride and joy.

220
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,639
I think you are.

221
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,779
All right.

222
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,120
So somebody's pride and joy.

223
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:09,200
So now another phrase that we took a look at, and it's a way of making conversation, especially with a person that you haven't seen in a while.

224
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,100
He said, hey, what's new with you?

225
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
What's new with you?

226
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,580
What's new with you?

227
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,080
All right.

228
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,279
So this might sound a little strange because normally we say, how have you been?

229
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,480
It's been a long time.

230
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,100
How are you?

231
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,759
But this is like, you know, it's a fluency builder phrase.

232
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,940
So it's very colloquial, very spoken language.

233
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,860
So this you hear often between friends or family members.

234
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:30,659
Hey, Marco, what's new with you?

235
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,100
So how do you, I would answer this by saying, oh, well, not much.

236
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,259
Or I just bought a new house.

237
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,220
So basically you're asking for news from a person.

238
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,600
I haven't seen you in a long time.

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,220
You look, you look happy and healthy.

240
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,460
So what's new with you?

241
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:44,720
Oh, I got married.

242
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,720
I got a new car.

243
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,340
These things that you can say, these are changes in my life.

244
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:49,759
All right.

245
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,240
And usually after somebody asks you, what's new with you?

246
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,600
You say something and then you usually would follow up and ask that person as well.

247
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Right.

248
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,320
What's new and what's new with you?

249
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:58,919
Exactly.

250
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,480
So, you know, I got a new house, got a new job.

251
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,639
What's new with you?

252
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,019
Yeah.

253
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:03,799
Or what about you?

254
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,440
What about you?

255
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,240
So it's a nice, very relaxed, informal way of asking someone for news in their life.

256
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:10,960
Perfect.

257
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:11,360
All right.

258
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,179
What's new with you?

259
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,220
Uh, what else now?

260
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,720
He was supposed to get married, right?

261
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:15,980
Right.

262
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:16,700
So this is news.

263
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,860
He was supposed to get married.

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,679
He didn't get married.

265
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,740
What's going on?

266
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,759
His brother, his mother, they all want to know what's going on.

267
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,820
And we find out that wedding, that girl, he just couldn't go through with it.

268
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:30,600
So I can't, I couldn't go through with it.

269
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,059
Okay.

270
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:31,720
This past tense.

271
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,539
So he's saying before I came to India with this girl, I couldn't go through with it.

272
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,279
So present would be, I can't go through with it.

273
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,120
And going through with what here?

274
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:41,720
We've got it.

275
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,720
So this kind of magical, strange word, it what it, what could this be?

276
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:52,399
So basically what he's saying is that he couldn't complete or maybe finish something that he started, right?

277
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,919
So in this case, we're talking about a relationship or marriage, a relationship.

278
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,559
So maybe we loved each other, but I couldn't go through with it.

279
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,500
I couldn't go to the finish line.

280
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:03,399
Right.

281
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,279
I couldn't get married.

282
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,299
You see that a lot when maybe in movies, two people are supposed to get married.

283
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,460
They're at the altar.

284
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,860
And all of a sudden the bride says, I can't, or she goes away crying.

285
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,039
I can't go through with this.

286
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,820
So because she loves somebody else.

287
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,799
So can't go through with it.

288
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:21,360
Great.

289
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,659
So really good phrase.

290
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:24,440
I can't go through with it.

291
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:26,340
He couldn't go through with it.

292
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,379
And we find out that, well, not such a bad thing, Steven.

293
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,799
He's very popular in India.

294
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,879
The girls love him.

295
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,519
We've got a great phrase for describing having lots of girls who love you.

296
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,379
Right.

297
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,620
He says there'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

298
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,379
Literally like, wow.

299
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,899
I can't imagine that.

300
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,679
Like just somebody throwing themselves.

301
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,860
No, it's not literal.

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,019
It's basically saying girls are very interested in you.

303
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,320
Girls are so interested in you that they'll be chasing you almost.

304
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:55,740
All right.

305
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,379
So many, many girls, they will, they will follow you.

306
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,700
They'll want to be in a relationship with you.

307
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,500
They like you.

308
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
So he's saying, listen, there are other girls.

309
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,039
Don't worry.

310
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,779
Girls here, they love you.

311
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,940
And it doesn't only work with girls, right?

312
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,720
I can say there'll be boys throwing themselves at you.

313
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Right.

314
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,159
So this is, uh, this is something we say about both genders, boys and girls.

315
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,500
You could say, Oh God, all the boys were throwing themselves at her.

316
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm so jealous.

317
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:21,940
Right.

318
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,200
So, but it's only basically in a loving way, right?

319
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:26,519
It can't be anything else.

320
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,379
Like somebody's chasing you for other reasons.

321
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,399
No, this is saying that they have crushes.

322
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,100
They have feelings.

323
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,080
They want to be romantic.

324
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:38,740
It's not like a, it's not a bad thing, but sometimes it's too much attention, so it can be kind of negative.

325
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:39,179
Yeah.

326
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:39,960
All right.

327
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,460
Well, interesting phrases on Fluency Builder today.

328
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,059
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time.

329
00:13:46,220 --> 00:14:02,399
Get up and dance.

330
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,620
Steven, good to see you, brother.

331
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,279
How are you?

332
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,279
How was your trip?

333
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:09,399
It was fine.

334
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,039
I've been better, but it's great to be home.

335
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,980
I've missed you all.

336
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:13,820
How's mom?

337
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:14,779
She's great.

338
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,159
All she ever does is talk about you, her little boy that went to the United States.

339
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,340
You're her pride and joy.

340
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,200
You know that, right?

341
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,100
I can't wait to see you.

342
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:23,940
You?

343
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,019
What's new with you?

344
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:30,360
Well, Nisha and I are expecting you'll have another nephew or niece soon.

345
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:31,860
That's great.

346
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,500
Wow.

347
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,759
Congrats.

348
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,159
You two are great together.

349
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,139
You know, you have such a beautiful family.

350
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:39,340
I hope that one day I can have that.

351
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,419
Of course, man.

352
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,080
Come on.

353
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,919
I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini.

354
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,179
You know, she's still pining after you.

355
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:47,960
I don't think she'll ever get over you.

356
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,419
What are you talking about?

357
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,500
I hardly knew her.

358
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,940
How could she be in love with me?

359
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,539
I can go through it even though she's a great woman.

360
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,080
No, I left my heart in the United States.

361
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:00,360
I just hope Veronica is happy.

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,860
Get over it.

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,879
You're home now.

364
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,220
Everyone here thinks so highly of you.

365
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:07,460
There'll be girls throwing themselves at you.

366
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:09,019
You can marry anyone you want.

367
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,799
I don't want to marry anyone.

368
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I want to marry her.

369
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,419
Don't you understand?

370
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,379
You are incredible.

371
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:28,919
Steven, my baby.

372
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,899
How are you?

373
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:31,639
I miss you so much.

374
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,299
Hey, Mom.

375
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,299
Great to see you.

376
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:34,480
You look so thin.

377
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,419
Didn't those Americans feed you?

378
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:37,500
Come, come.

379
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,700
Let's have some time.

380
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,600
By the way, there is a girl here waiting for you.

381
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,279
Hi, Steven.

382
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,059
Veronica, how did you get here?

383
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,980
How do you know where I live?

384
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,080
I waited for you at the airport, but you never showed.

385
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,039
I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later.

386
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I realized that I was just scared, scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires.

387
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,320
I'm here now.

388
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,779
Now, there's something I want to ask you.

389
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,600
Steven, will you marry me?

390
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,179
I now declare you husband and wife.

391
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,460
You may kiss the bride.

392
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:41,980
All right, so it's over.

393
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,259
Ah, sad, sad but sweet.

394
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,299
Sad but sweet, huh?

395
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,539
Well, we went from them meeting casually by a bike accident.

396
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,299
Yeah, we had nice music.

397
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,580
Then it turned out that she was angry.

398
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,659
They kind of broke up.

399
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,820
They got back together.

400
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,120
He was being strained with all of these secret trips to save people.

401
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,640
It was interesting.

402
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,000
We went a lot of different ways.

403
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,160
She was pregnant.

404
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,299
She wasn't really pregnant.

405
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,900
The doctor was stalking her.

406
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,660
He's in the secret service.

407
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,519
It was an interesting ride.

408
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:16,700
Very interesting.

409
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:22,480
Well, now we need to think of a new drama, a new soap opera or novel.

410
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,299
So we need your input.

411
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,759
Maybe we should open it up.

412
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,519
What did you like?

413
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,460
What didn't you like and what kind of genre are you interested in?

414
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,660
Because, you know, there's tons of different kinds of stories we could tell.

415
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,019
Right, maybe we can do something scary like a thriller or horror.

416
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,420
I'm a big fan of sci-fi.

417
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,339
Or sci-fi.

418
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,940
Maybe we can do something sci-fi.

419
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,519
Maybe we can do a comedy, something maybe like Friends.

420
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,140
I don't know.

421
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,980
That'd be kind of cute.

422
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,099
Yeah, it could be.

423
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,400
All right, so listeners, why don't you give us your input?

424
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,259
We need your feedback.

425
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Tell us what series you would like next.

426
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,359
What type of series?

427
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,099
Maybe like we said drama, sci-fi, action.

428
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:57,980
What would you like?

429
00:17:58,539 --> 00:17:59,740
