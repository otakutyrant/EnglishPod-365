00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we have an elementary lesson for you and we are at the supermarket.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're at the grocery store and we're going to learn some language you can use when you want to pay for your groceries.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this lesson was requested by one of our users that wanted vocabulary and different phrases that are used in the supermarket when the person is about to pay for all the things they need.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And we also have some great language that the person who is actually selling the groceries can use.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what happens.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Excuse me, sir.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is the express checkout lane for people who have 15 items or fewer.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, come on.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I have 16 items.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Cut me some slack, will ya?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Fine.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Plastic.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I also have a couple of coupons.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No problem.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll take those.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Darn.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh well.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I guess it's just not my day.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thanks anyway.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, I got a club card.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Here you go.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Will this be debit or credit?

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Debit, please.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Also, could I get cash back?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
$50 would be great.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, sure.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your total is $78.33.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Here's your receipt.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Have a nice day.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, we can see in this dialogue that the guy was able to buy his food and, you know, they were using some really interesting, helpful language.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And so why don't we look at this language now in Language Takeaway?

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We have six words for you today.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And the first one, the girl, the cashier says, this is the express checkout lane.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All right.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So checkout lane.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The checkout lane.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So the checkout lane is the place where you get in line to pay for all the goods you bought.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So the checkout lane.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now, why did she say express checkout lane?

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So in grocery stores or in supermarkets, sometimes you have a specific checkout lane that's faster because people have less things.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So express is the faster checkout lane.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Right.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The faster one.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All right.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So next she tells the guy to put your items on the belt.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The belt.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The belt.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A belt.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now we know belt as the thing you put around your waist.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To keep your pants up.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right.

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But in a supermarket, the belt is the moving table that you put your groceries on so the cashier starts to pass them through.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So the belt.

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The belt.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Put your groceries on the belt.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And then the guy said that he had a couple of coupons.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Coupons.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Coupons.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A coupon.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So what is a coupon?

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A coupon is a piece of paper you can use to get a discount.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All right.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So it has a discount on it.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A discount for one thing.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Like, so maybe you buy some apples and you get 10% off one kind of apple.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Very good.

87
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Coupons.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now he presented these coupons and she said they were expired.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The coupons expired yesterday.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Expired.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
To expire.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All right.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So to expire, that means?

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
To be older than the date when you can use them.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use expired so we can understand a little bit better.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Example one.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry, sir.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This credit card expired five years ago.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can't use it anymore.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Example two.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My driver's license expires in a month, so I have to get it renewed.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Example three.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't drink that.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The milk has expired.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So we can see his coupons expired.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So they were too old and he couldn't use them anymore.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Exactly.

110
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And now, finally, she asked him if he wants to pay with his club card or cash.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So club card.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Club card.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What's a club card?

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So in some supermarkets, you can receive a special type of credit card that you can only use for grocery shopping.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And only in that store.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Right.

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So that is a club card.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All right.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So a club card.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So he's going to pay with a card, but he also asks for some cash back.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Cash back.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Could I get cash back?

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Cash back.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now, what's he talking about?

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can you get cash back?

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He's paying with a card.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What does he want to do?

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, what happens is sometimes, suppose your groceries cost $20.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So instead of charging $20 to your credit card or your club card, you say, okay, put $70.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So then the cashier can give you $50 back.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So you can have cash in your pocket.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ah, so instead of going to the ATM, you can get your money in one spot.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Exactly.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All right.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So that's cash back.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Interesting.

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, why don't we hear this one more time in the dialogue, but let's slow it down a little so we can understand better.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Excuse me, sir.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is the express checkout lane for people that have 15 items or fewer.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, come on.

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have 16 items.

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Cut me some slack, will ya?

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Fine.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Plastic.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I also have a couple of coupons.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No problem.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll take those.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Darn.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, well, I guess it's just not my day.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thanks anyway.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, I got a club card.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Here you go.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Will this be debit or credit?

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Debit, please.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Also, can I get cash back?

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
$50 would be great.

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, sure.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Your total is $78.33.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here's your receipt.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Have a nice day.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right, so now that we've listened to the dialogue for the second time, it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Fluency Builder.

171
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay, we have three phrases for you now.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, the guy was not having a very good day, was he?

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So he couldn't go in the express checkout lane and he says, Cut me some slack.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Cut me some slack.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
To cut someone some slack.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All right, now this is an interesting and very informal phrase, so before we explain it, why don't we listen to a couple of other examples.

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Example one.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Cut me some slack.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm only two minutes late.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Example two.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
My wife just had a baby and I'm so tired.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Cut me some slack.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll send you the report tomorrow.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Example three.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Emily had a really bad week.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think you should cut her some slack.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, I think I can understand it means, um, relax the rules a little bit.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Right, so don't be so strict on me.

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, don't be so hard.

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Now, I know this this phrase actually comes from mountain climbing.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, really?

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, because of the rope.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, so it's just it's like saying the slack is loose rope.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's just saying give me a little bit more freedom.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Give me more freedom.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Interesting.

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, to cut somebody some slack.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, now the cashier asked him a question.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
She says, do you prefer paper or plastic?

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Paper or plastic.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now, this is the common cliche phrase that any grocery store cashier will use, right?

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, so paper or plastic what?

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Bags.

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Paper or plastic bags.

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right, so you'll hear this all the time in every grocery store.

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you want paper or plastic?

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right, so you can choose plastic bags or paper bags.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, remember this one because when you get it right, you'll sound really native like.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Very good.

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And our last phrase, since he wasn't really having a good day, he said, it's just not my day.

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's just not my day.

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not my day.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, so when it's not your day.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It means the day has been hard.

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You've not really lucky.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, it's not a good day for you.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Not a good day.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about grocery stores in America.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Excuse me, sir.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is the express checkout lane for people who have 15 items or fewer.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, come on.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have 16 items.

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Cut me some slack, will you?

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Fine.

227
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Plastic.

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I also have a couple of coupons.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No problem, I'll take those.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Darn.

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh well, I guess it's just not my day.

235
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thanks anyway.

236
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, I got a club card.

238
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Here you go.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Will this be debit or credit?

240
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Debit, please.

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Also, could I get cash back?

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
$50 would be great.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, sure.

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your total is $78.33.

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Here's your receipt.

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Have a nice day.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, one interesting thing I know about grocery stores in America is that the people who are the cashiers are very often students.

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's a very popular summer job or part-time job like college students.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, or even in my hometown it was the most common job for high school students.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
After school, if you went to the grocery store between 4 o'clock and 9 o'clock at night, every single cashier would be a high school student.

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And the interesting thing is that the cashiers are usually women, right?

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, always the high school girls who are the cashiers.

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And so the high school boys would be working in the back, maybe in the warehouse carrying boxes or stocking the shelves.

254
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So putting the cans on the shelves, right?

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a very popular part-time job for students in the United States.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But also, coupons are very popular in America.

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, what is it about coupons?

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, usually, for example, in the Sunday newspaper, you will receive a lot of coupons.

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You go to the grocery store and you have all these coupons for like cookies or a promotion on some type of soda or drink.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So it's very popular.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
People go grocery shopping and then present all these coupons and actually you can end up saving a good amount of money.

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I know the coupons are usually like, save two cents or save 25 cents.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But I guess if you put all of those together, you can save money.

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's interesting because people actually will buy that product just because they have a coupon.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Coupons and high school checkout girls.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, guys, thanks for listening to this show.
