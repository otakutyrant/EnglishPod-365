00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,159
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,020
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,839
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:04,960
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we have an elementary lesson for you and we are at the supermarket.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:10,900
That's right.

7
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:18,640
We're at the grocery store and we're going to learn some language you can use when you want to pay for your groceries.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:31,500
So this lesson was requested by one of our users that wanted vocabulary and different phrases that are used in the supermarket when the person is about to pay for all the things they need.

9
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:32,079
That's right.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:39,820
And we also have some great language that the person who is actually selling the groceries can use.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:40,859
All right.

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,520
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what happens.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,399
Excuse me, sir.

14
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,000
This is the express checkout lane for people who have 15 items or fewer.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,179
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

16
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,179
Oh, come on.

17
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,539
I have 16 items.

18
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,159
Cut me some slack, will ya?

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,040
Fine.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,359
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,159
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

22
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,099
Plastic.

23
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,819
I also have a couple of coupons.

24
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,400
No problem.

25
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,060
I'll take those.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,260
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

27
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,079
Darn.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Oh well.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,859
I guess it's just not my day.

30
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:37,799
Thanks anyway.

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,500
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

32
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,959
Yeah, I got a club card.

33
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:42,780
Here you go.

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,739
Will this be debit or credit?

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,000
Debit, please.

36
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,140
Also, could I get cash back?

37
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,519
$50 would be great.

38
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:50,540
Yeah, sure.

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,579
Your total is $78.33.

40
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:56,680
Here's your receipt.

41
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:57,500
Have a nice day.

42
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:12,620
Well, we can see in this dialogue that the guy was able to buy his food and, you know, they were using some really interesting, helpful language.

43
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,879
That's right.

44
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,039
And so why don't we look at this language now in Language Takeaway?

45
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,240
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay.

47
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:24,879
We have six words for you today.

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,259
And the first one, the girl, the cashier says, this is the express checkout lane.

49
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:33,780
All right.

50
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,139
So checkout lane.

51
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,699
The checkout lane.

52
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:43,180
So the checkout lane is the place where you get in line to pay for all the goods you bought.

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,659
Right.

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,180
So the checkout lane.

55
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:48,740
Now, why did she say express checkout lane?

56
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:58,060
So in grocery stores or in supermarkets, sometimes you have a specific checkout lane that's faster because people have less things.

57
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,819
So express is the faster checkout lane.

58
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:01,099
Right.

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,960
The faster one.

60
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:02,400
All right.

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,680
So next she tells the guy to put your items on the belt.

62
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Okay.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,800
The belt.

64
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:10,520
The belt.

65
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,500
A belt.

66
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,659
Now we know belt as the thing you put around your waist.

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,060
To keep your pants up.

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,460
Right.

69
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:25,199
But in a supermarket, the belt is the moving table that you put your groceries on so the cashier starts to pass them through.

70
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:25,759
Okay.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,759
So the belt.

72
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay.

73
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,139
The belt.

74
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,620
Put your groceries on the belt.

75
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,340
And then the guy said that he had a couple of coupons.

76
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,539
Coupons.

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,659
Coupons.

78
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,419
A coupon.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,120
Okay.

80
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,020
So what is a coupon?

81
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,740
A coupon is a piece of paper you can use to get a discount.

82
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,699
All right.

83
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,620
So it has a discount on it.

84
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,060
A discount for one thing.

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,819
Like, so maybe you buy some apples and you get 10% off one kind of apple.

86
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,659
Very good.

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,340
Coupons.

88
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,139
Now he presented these coupons and she said they were expired.

89
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
The coupons expired yesterday.

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Expired.

91
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,120
To expire.

92
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,099
All right.

93
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,099
So to expire, that means?

94
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,740
To be older than the date when you can use them.

95
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,419
Right.

96
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:21,439
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use expired so we can understand a little bit better.

97
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,259
Example one.

98
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,379
I'm sorry, sir.

99
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,000
This credit card expired five years ago.

100
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:30,279
You can't use it anymore.

101
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
Example two.

102
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,680
My driver's license expires in a month, so I have to get it renewed.

103
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:41,779
Example three.

104
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,639
Don't drink that.

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,779
The milk has expired.

106
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,579
Okay.

107
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,139
So we can see his coupons expired.

108
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,579
So they were too old and he couldn't use them anymore.

109
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,480
Exactly.

110
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,740
And now, finally, she asked him if he wants to pay with his club card or cash.

111
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,540
So club card.

112
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,860
Club card.

113
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,019
What's a club card?

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,339
So in some supermarkets, you can receive a special type of credit card that you can only use for grocery shopping.

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,540
And only in that store.

116
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,220
Right.

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,480
So that is a club card.

118
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,040
All right.

119
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,259
So a club card.

120
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:21,879
Okay.

121
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:27,420
So he's going to pay with a card, but he also asks for some cash back.

122
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,480
Cash back.

123
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,800
Could I get cash back?

124
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,019
Cash back.

125
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,240
Now, what's he talking about?

126
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,339
Can you get cash back?

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,399
He's paying with a card.

128
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,300
What does he want to do?

129
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,420
Well, what happens is sometimes, suppose your groceries cost $20.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,139
Okay.

131
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,420
So instead of charging $20 to your credit card or your club card, you say, okay, put $70.

132
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,759
So then the cashier can give you $50 back.

133
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,399
So you can have cash in your pocket.

134
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,399
Ah, so instead of going to the ATM, you can get your money in one spot.

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,980
Exactly.

136
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,540
All right.

137
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
So that's cash back.

138
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,319
Interesting.

139
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:08,600
Well, why don't we hear this one more time in the dialogue, but let's slow it down a little so we can understand better.

140
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,720
Excuse me, sir.

141
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:20,720
This is the express checkout lane for people that have 15 items or fewer.

142
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,220
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

143
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,439
Oh, come on.

144
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,360
I have 16 items.

145
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,079
Cut me some slack, will ya?

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,100
Fine.

147
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,120
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

148
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

149
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,040
Plastic.

150
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,319
I also have a couple of coupons.

151
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,060
No problem.

152
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,339
I'll take those.

153
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,480
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

154
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,139
Darn.

155
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,040
Oh, well, I guess it's just not my day.

156
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,459
Thanks anyway.

157
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,800
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

158
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, I got a club card.

159
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,279
Here you go.

160
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,860
Will this be debit or credit?

161
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,300
Debit, please.

162
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,879
Also, can I get cash back?

163
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,180
$50 would be great.

164
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,819
Yeah, sure.

165
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Your total is $78.33.

166
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
Here's your receipt.

167
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,180
Have a nice day.

168
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:26,319
Thank you.

169
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:37,120
All right, so now that we've listened to the dialogue for the second time, it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

170
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,319
Fluency Builder.

171
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,620
Okay, we have three phrases for you now.

172
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,600
Well, the guy was not having a very good day, was he?

173
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,500
So he couldn't go in the express checkout lane and he says, Cut me some slack.

174
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,339
Cut me some slack.

175
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,699
To cut someone some slack.

176
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:05,019
All right, now this is an interesting and very informal phrase, so before we explain it, why don't we listen to a couple of other examples.

177
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,379
Example one.

178
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,439
Cut me some slack.

179
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,220
I'm only two minutes late.

180
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,000
Example two.

181
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,740
My wife just had a baby and I'm so tired.

182
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,360
Cut me some slack.

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,300
I'll send you the report tomorrow.

184
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Example three.

185
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:30,120
Emily had a really bad week.

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,340
I think you should cut her some slack.

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,940
Okay, I think I can understand it means, um, relax the rules a little bit.

188
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:43,320
Right, so don't be so strict on me.

189
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,460
Yeah, don't be so hard.

190
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,799
Now, I know this this phrase actually comes from mountain climbing.

191
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:50,360
Oh, really?

192
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,539
Oh, because of the rope.

193
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,600
Yeah, so it's just it's like saying the slack is loose rope.

194
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,559
He's just saying give me a little bit more freedom.

195
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,399
Give me more freedom.

196
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,159
Interesting.

197
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,500
Yeah, to cut somebody some slack.

198
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:05,860
Well, now the cashier asked him a question.

199
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,840
She says, do you prefer paper or plastic?

200
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,919
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

201
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
Paper or plastic.

202
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,840
Now, this is the common cliche phrase that any grocery store cashier will use, right?

203
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,779
Yeah, so paper or plastic what?

204
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,519
Bags.

205
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,799
Paper or plastic bags.

206
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,419
All right, so you'll hear this all the time in every grocery store.

207
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,740
Do you want paper or plastic?

208
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:31,700
Right, so you can choose plastic bags or paper bags.

209
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,600
Okay, remember this one because when you get it right, you'll sound really native like.

210
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,759
Very good.

211
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,059
And our last phrase, since he wasn't really having a good day, he said, it's just not my day.

212
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,059
It's just not my day.

213
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,419
It's not my day.

214
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,580
Okay, so when it's not your day.

215
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,220
It means the day has been hard.

216
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,360
You've not really lucky.

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,799
Yeah, it's not a good day for you.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
Not a good day.

219
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:04,980
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about grocery stores in America.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,919
Excuse me, sir.

221
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:19,500
This is the express checkout lane for people who have 15 items or fewer.

222
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,659
It looks like you have more than 15 items there.

223
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,700
Oh, come on.

224
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,039
I have 16 items.

225
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,639
Cut me some slack, will you?

226
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:27,539
Fine.

227
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,039
Please place your items on the belt and push your shopping cart through.

228
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,659
Do you prefer paper or plastic?

229
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,580
Plastic.

230
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,240
I also have a couple of coupons.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
No problem, I'll take those.

232
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,740
Sir, these coupons expired yesterday.

233
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,539
Darn.

234
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Oh well, I guess it's just not my day.

235
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,279
Thanks anyway.

236
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,940
Do you have a club card or will it be cash?

237
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,419
Yeah, I got a club card.

238
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,240
Here you go.

239
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,240
Will this be debit or credit?

240
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,460
Debit, please.

241
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,600
Also, could I get cash back?

242
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,019
$50 would be great.

243
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,039
Yeah, sure.

244
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,080
Your total is $78.33.

245
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,179
Here's your receipt.

246
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,000
Have a nice day.

247
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,600
Well, one interesting thing I know about grocery stores in America is that the people who are the cashiers are very often students.

248
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,120
It's a very popular summer job or part-time job like college students.

249
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,639
Yeah, or even in my hometown it was the most common job for high school students.

250
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:53,500
After school, if you went to the grocery store between 4 o'clock and 9 o'clock at night, every single cashier would be a high school student.

251
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,480
And the interesting thing is that the cashiers are usually women, right?

252
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,340
Yeah, always the high school girls who are the cashiers.

253
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,080
And so the high school boys would be working in the back, maybe in the warehouse carrying boxes or stocking the shelves.

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,080
So putting the cans on the shelves, right?

255
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,059
It's a very popular part-time job for students in the United States.

256
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,759
But also, coupons are very popular in America.

257
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,440
Yeah, what is it about coupons?

258
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,360
Well, usually, for example, in the Sunday newspaper, you will receive a lot of coupons.

259
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:35,700
You go to the grocery store and you have all these coupons for like cookies or a promotion on some type of soda or drink.

260
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,759
So it's very popular.

261
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:44,259
People go grocery shopping and then present all these coupons and actually you can end up saving a good amount of money.

262
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:49,179
I know the coupons are usually like, save two cents or save 25 cents.

263
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
But I guess if you put all of those together, you can save money.

264
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,820
It's interesting because people actually will buy that product just because they have a coupon.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,940
Coupons and high school checkout girls.

266
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,899
Well, guys, thanks for listening to this show.
