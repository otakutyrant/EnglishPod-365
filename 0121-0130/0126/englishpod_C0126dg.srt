EnglishPod.com Hello everyone and welcome to Open Mic Night.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert Hicks.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you everyone.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, what a lovely crowd.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand-up comedy.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now and I've got some real zingers for you tonight.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's start out with some short jokes.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How about that?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Where do you find a one-legged dog?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Where you left it?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Get it?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A cloud.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Tough crowd.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Alright, now you're going to love this joke.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's hilarious.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What do cows do for entertainment?

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They rent movies.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Movies.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, we've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Damn!

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Get out of here!

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay, last one.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because they've got big fingers.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They've got big fingers.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thanks everyone, that was my time.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thanks for watching!
