EnglishPod.com Hello everyone and welcome to Open Mic Night.

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,480
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:20,820
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert Hicks.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,199
Thank you everyone.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
Well, what a lovely crowd.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,280
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand-up comedy.

7
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,320
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now and I've got some real zingers for you tonight.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,219
Let's start out with some short jokes.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:39,939
How about that?

10
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,780
Where do you find a one-legged dog?

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:46,840
Where you left it?

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,700
Get it?

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,119
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

14
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,640
A cloud.

15
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:01,619
Tough crowd.

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,859
Alright, now you're going to love this joke.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,780
It's hilarious.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,299
What do cows do for entertainment?

19
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,519
They rent movies.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,640
Movies.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,819
Okay, we've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good.

22
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,400
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,620
Damn!

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,159
Get out of here!

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,859
Okay, okay, okay, okay, last one.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,400
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,400
Because they've got big fingers.

28
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:48,540
They've got big fingers.

29
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,159
Thanks everyone, that was my time.

30
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,780
Thanks for watching!
