00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,859
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,500
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,160
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,720
And today we're going to have a fun, funny lesson.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,419
That's right.

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,220
So I think this lesson is going to be a little bit different than most of our lessons, right?

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:15,740
Right.

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,260
Today we're going to be looking at jokes, which is a very important part of English-speaking culture.

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:21,640
Yeah.

11
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:33,100
So we're actually going to teach you a few pretty hilarious jokes, but we're also going to teach you some language related to jokes, funny things, and that sort of stuff.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:33,880
All right.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:41,719
So in order for us to understand a little bit better the jokes that we're going to be looking at, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:43,979
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,560
Two of these words you'll hear in the dialogue, but one you won't, but you still need to know this word so you can understand the jokes.

16
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:51,060
All right.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,000
So the word that we're talking about is not really a word.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,700
It's a sound.

19
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,000
Moo.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,619
Moo.

21
00:00:57,279 --> 00:01:00,359
So moo is the sound that cows make.

22
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:00,799
That's right.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,500
M-O-O.

24
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:01,759
Right.

25
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:02,880
They go moo.

26
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,060
Very nice, Marco.

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,519
I could do a good cow.

28
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:05,840
Yep.

29
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,540
All right.

30
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,079
So we all know now that that's what cows say.

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,980
Exactly.

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:12,260
So it's going to be important for the joke.

33
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:12,959
You'll see why.

34
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,420
Okay.

35
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:17,260
Now another word that you need to understand is a dam.

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,719
So a dam.

37
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:19,819
A dam.

38
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,579
A dam is like a big wall, right?

39
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:27,319
Well, it's a wall in water that stops the river from flowing.

40
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:28,019
Okay.

41
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:33,319
So usually you build dams in rivers and then the water can pass or not.

42
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:33,840
Yeah.

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,159
It's something that you use to generate electricity, right?

44
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:36,859
Very good.

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,299
But there's another word that sounds exactly the same way, but it's just spelled a little differently.

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:41,879
That's right.

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,459
And we might hear someone say, oh, dam.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,359
And that's an interjection, which basically means.

49
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,459
Oh, no.

50
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,079
Right.

51
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,780
That's terrible.

52
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,739
Damn.

53
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,120
I can say, damn, I forgot my keys.

54
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,040
Damn.

55
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,079
We're late for the movie.

56
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:55,680
Okay.

57
00:01:55,959 --> 00:02:00,019
So it's an interesting interjection and we'll also see it in one of our jokes.

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,620
And now let's move on to our last word.

59
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:03,959
Nostrils.

60
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:04,980
Okay.

61
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:05,780
Nostrils.

62
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:06,560
Nostrils.

63
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,139
So a nostril or your nostrils.

64
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,840
The two holes in your nose.

65
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,259
Right.

66
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,139
You breathe through your nostrils.

67
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,400
All right.

68
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,960
So now that we've taken a look at these three words, why don't we listen to our comedian for the first time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

69
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,919
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Open Mic Night.

70
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,699
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

71
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,960
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert Hicks.

72
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,439
Thank you, everyone.

73
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,300
Well, what a lovely crowd.

74
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,479
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand up comedy.

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,539
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now, and I've got some real zingers for you tonight.

76
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,419
Let's start out with some short jokes.

77
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,060
How about that?

78
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,000
Where do you find a one legged dog?

79
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,039
Where you left it?

80
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:13,740
Get it?

81
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,300
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

82
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,840
A cloud.

83
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,840
Tough crowd.

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,479
All right.

85
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,080
Now, you're going to love this joke.

86
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,000
It's hilarious.

87
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,520
What do cows do for entertainment?

88
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,759
They rent movies.

89
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,580
Movies.

90
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,759
Okay.

91
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,370
Okay.

92
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,050
There are a lot of wrestlers in the audience, but this one is good.

93
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,629
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

94
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:50,750
Damn.

95
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:56,710
Okay.

96
00:03:58,669 --> 00:03:58,949
Okay.

97
00:03:59,009 --> 00:03:59,210
Okay.

98
00:03:59,210 --> 00:03:59,509
Okay.

99
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,990
Last one.

100
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,629
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

101
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,729
Because they got big fingers.

102
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,949
They got big fingers.

103
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:11,770
Stop.

104
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,949
Get off the stage.

105
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,629
Thanks, everyone.

106
00:04:13,729 --> 00:04:14,430
That was my time.

107
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,430
Okay.

108
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,569
So some pretty hilarious jokes, huh?

109
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,329
I don't think the crowd really enjoyed them all that much.

110
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:25,709
Okay.

111
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:28,670
Well, maybe I'm just a fan of really terrible jokes.

112
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,629
Well, they were pretty funny, but I guess the crowd just didn't appreciate his sense of humor.

113
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,290
But you know what?

114
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,269
They did use quite a lot of really interesting language, so why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

115
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,269
Language Takeaway.

116
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,889
On Language Takeaway, we're going to be looking at six words today, so let's get started.

117
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,069
The announcer welcomed everyone and said that it's open mic night.

118
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,310
Open mic night.

119
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,430
So an open mic night.

120
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:55,910
Okay.

121
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,410
Well, we know mic is short for microphone, right?

122
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,329
Now, an open mic night is a chance where anyone can come up and talk into the microphone.

123
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,069
So you can come up and sing, or you can tell jokes.

124
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,250
You can do anything, basically.

125
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:09,550
Yep.

126
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,269
All right.

127
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:10,949
Open mic.

128
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:14,689
So it's not for professionals, but for people who maybe want to be professionals.

129
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:15,370
Amateurs.

130
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,529
So it was open mic night, and he said they had a lot of great comics there.

131
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,970
So comics.

132
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:23,149
A comic.

133
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:23,930
A comic.

134
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,209
So basically, a comic is a person that makes a living by making people laugh.

135
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,129
Yeah, someone who stands up on stage and tells jokes.

136
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:32,689
All right.

137
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,069
Would you say a clown is kind of like a comic?

138
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,449
No, they're different.

139
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,389
They're different, right?

140
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,230
A comic doesn't wear a red nose and a crazy costume.

141
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,189
All right.

142
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,430
Yeah, because I hate clowns.

143
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,589
We do know that about you.

144
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,329
All right.

145
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,509
So a comic.

146
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,029
And well, what comics do is they perform stand-up comedy.

147
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:52,089
Stand-up comedy.

148
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,649
Stand-up comedy.

149
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:58,889
Okay, so stand-up comedy is really exactly what its name suggests, right?

150
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,649
Right.

151
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:04,569
You stand up in front of an audience, and you tell jokes, or you make them laugh.

152
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,649
Yeah, tell funny stories.

153
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,250
It's a very popular form of entertainment in the United States and the UK.

154
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:11,089
That's right.

155
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,110
And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the lesson.

156
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,689
But why don't we move on to our next word, which is routine.

157
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:19,949
A routine.

158
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,250
So the guy says, I've been working on my routine.

159
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:24,990
So what does he mean by his routine?

160
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:34,189
Well, I guess a routine is like a series or a collection of jokes or maybe movements that you use in a performance.

161
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,910
All right, a routine.

162
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,629
So you can talk about a dance routine.

163
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,230
Or in this case, a comedy routine.

164
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,509
So the series of jokes he's going to tell.

165
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:46,110
That's right, that he practices again and again and again.

166
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:46,930
All right.

167
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,709
And in his routine, he said he's got a lot of zingers, zingers, a zinger.

168
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:53,829
So what's a zinger?

169
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,629
Basically a zinger is like a strong, maybe a little bit rude joke.

170
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,149
Yeah, but like a kind of a one line joke, right?

171
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:01,790
Exactly.

172
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,410
Yeah.

173
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:09,290
And the people that were in the crowd and they were booing him, they're like, boo, those we call hecklers.

174
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:09,870
Exactly.

175
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:10,829
And that's our last word.

176
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:11,649
A heckler.

177
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:12,670
A heckler.

178
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,629
Hecklers.

179
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:17,589
So let's listen to some hecklers in action.

180
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,569
All right, well, I think that's pretty clear.

181
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,350
Those are definitely hecklers.

182
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,730
Right.

183
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,610
They're very annoying.

184
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:39,269
So now that we've finished looking at all the words that are related to comedy and performances, let's take a look at the jokes now in Fluency Builder.

185
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,589
Fluency Builder.

186
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:51,290
OK, well, we're not really focusing on new phrases for you here, but we thought it would be helpful to talk a little bit about the jokes to help you understand them.

187
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:51,449
Right.

188
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,209
Because they are, well, I think pretty funny.

189
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,930
Yeah, they're pretty funny, but maybe sometimes they're kind of hard to understand.

190
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,069
So why don't we start with the first joke?

191
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,149
So you said, where do you find a one legged dog?

192
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:05,129
So what's a one legged dog?

193
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:07,430
Basically it's a dog that has one leg.

194
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:07,949
OK.

195
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,910
And the pronunciation here is important, right?

196
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:10,670
One legged.

197
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,730
Not one legged.

198
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,269
No.

199
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:13,089
One legged.

200
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,129
So you can say one legged dog, a two legged dog or a three legged dog.

201
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:19,230
Six legged dog?

202
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:22,470
A six legged spider maybe lost two legs in a war.

203
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:23,329
Oh, dear.

204
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,550
OK, so the dog obviously didn't go anywhere, and so that's why you find it where you left it.

205
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,069
Exactly.

206
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,290
So that's why it's kind of funny.

207
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:31,889
OK.

208
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:32,529
All right.

209
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,070
So then he said, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

210
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,649
I don't know.

211
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,190
A cloud, basically because, you know, sheep are fluffy and they're white.

212
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,570
So if you take away their legs, they look like a little cloud.

213
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:47,610
All right.

214
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,149
Let's look at the next one.

215
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,590
He asked, what do cows do for entertainment?

216
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,269
And then the answer was they rent movies.

217
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,190
Exactly.

218
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:05,309
So it's kind of funny because he's relating this word movies with what the with the sound that cows make, which is moo.

219
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:05,669
Right.

220
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:10,789
And actually, there are a million jokes in English following the same pattern.

221
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,789
Yeah, exactly.

222
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,169
So I'm sure you can find a lot more of them and you can share them with us.

223
00:09:15,309 --> 00:09:21,210
Now, my personal favorite joke is the guy says, what does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

224
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,570
So to run into a wall basically is to crash against the wall.

225
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:24,850
Yeah.

226
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,370
So what does the fish say?

227
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:26,990
Damn.

228
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:28,750
So why is this funny?

229
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,590
Why does it say damn?

230
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:36,190
Well, because I mean, if you if you if you're a person and you run into a wall, damn, like, you know, just like, oh, no.

231
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:39,809
But a fish is swimming under the water.

232
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:42,929
Like we saw a dam is actually like a wall in the water.

233
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,250
So he's saying like, oh, a wall.

234
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:45,710
Yeah.

235
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:46,070
Yeah.

236
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:47,789
So it's that I like that one.

237
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:48,950
All right.

238
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,450
The last one was pretty good.

239
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,950
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

240
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,149
OK, so the big holes in their nose.

241
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:55,529
Right.

242
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:00,850
And basically, it's because they have big fingers so they can put their fingers in the nose.

243
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:01,429
Yeah, exactly.

244
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,129
Oh dear.

245
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:05,629
If the gorilla didn't have big nostrils, he wouldn't be able to pick his nose.

246
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,210
Maybe he'd have to use a stick.

247
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,950
Yeah, but that wouldn't be convenient.

248
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,269
See.

249
00:10:09,669 --> 00:10:09,789
All right.

250
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,870
So that's why those jokes are funny.

251
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:13,210
They're very short jokes.

252
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:20,409
Of course, some of them are not actually really funny, but it's just a little bit of a taste of short American jokes.

253
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:28,490
OK, well, I think we need to hear them one more time in context so you can all know how funny or maybe not so funny they are.

254
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:38,009
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Open Mic Night.

255
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,789
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

256
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:49,129
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert Hicks.

257
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,549
Thank you, everyone.

258
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:54,409
Well, what a lovely crowd.

259
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,570
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand up comedy.

260
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:04,649
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now and I've got some real zingers for you tonight.

261
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,529
Let's start out with some short jokes.

262
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:08,250
How about that?

263
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,110
Where do you find a one legged dog?

264
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,169
Where you left it.

265
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:20,009
Get it?

266
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,389
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

267
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:26,889
A cloud.

268
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:29,929
Tough crowd.

269
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:30,610
All right.

270
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,169
Now, you're going to love this joke.

271
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,110
It's hilarious.

272
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,610
What do cows do for entertainment?

273
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:40,690
They rent movies, movies.

274
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,070
OK, OK, OK, we've got a OK, we've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good.

275
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,750
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

276
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,809
Damn.

277
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,110
OK, OK, OK, OK, last one.

278
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,710
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

279
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,710
Because they got big fingers.

280
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,710
Thanks, everyone.

281
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,490
That was my time.

282
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:32,730

Don't come with me.

287
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:40,090
Yeah, no swears.

288
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,850
No swearing in the jokes.

289
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:42,230
Yep.

Bye.
