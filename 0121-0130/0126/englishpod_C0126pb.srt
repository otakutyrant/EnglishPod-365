00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're going to have a fun, funny lesson.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So I think this lesson is going to be a little bit different than most of our lessons, right?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we're going to be looking at jokes, which is a very important part of English-speaking culture.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we're actually going to teach you a few pretty hilarious jokes, but we're also going to teach you some language related to jokes, funny things, and that sort of stuff.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
All right.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So in order for us to understand a little bit better the jokes that we're going to be looking at, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Two of these words you'll hear in the dialogue, but one you won't, but you still need to know this word so you can understand the jokes.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All right.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So the word that we're talking about is not really a word.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's a sound.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Moo.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Moo.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So moo is the sound that cows make.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
M-O-O.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They go moo.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Very nice, Marco.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I could do a good cow.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yep.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So we all know now that that's what cows say.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Exactly.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So it's going to be important for the joke.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You'll see why.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now another word that you need to understand is a dam.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So a dam.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A dam.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A dam is like a big wall, right?

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, it's a wall in water that stops the river from flowing.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So usually you build dams in rivers and then the water can pass or not.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's something that you use to generate electricity, right?

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Very good.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But there's another word that sounds exactly the same way, but it's just spelled a little differently.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right.

47
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And we might hear someone say, oh, dam.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And that's an interjection, which basically means.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, no.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Right.

51
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's terrible.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Damn.

53
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I can say, damn, I forgot my keys.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Damn.

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're late for the movie.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So it's an interesting interjection and we'll also see it in one of our jokes.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And now let's move on to our last word.

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Nostrils.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay.

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Nostrils.

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Nostrils.

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So a nostril or your nostrils.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The two holes in your nose.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right.

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You breathe through your nostrils.

67
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right.

68
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So now that we've taken a look at these three words, why don't we listen to our comedian for the first time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Open Mic Night.

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert Hicks.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you, everyone.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, what a lovely crowd.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand up comedy.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now, and I've got some real zingers for you tonight.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's start out with some short jokes.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How about that?

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Where do you find a one legged dog?

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Where you left it?

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Get it?

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A cloud.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Tough crowd.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All right.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now, you're going to love this joke.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's hilarious.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What do cows do for entertainment?

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They rent movies.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Movies.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There are a lot of wrestlers in the audience, but this one is good.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Damn.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Last one.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Because they got big fingers.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They got big fingers.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Stop.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Get off the stage.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thanks, everyone.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That was my time.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So some pretty hilarious jokes, huh?

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't think the crowd really enjoyed them all that much.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, maybe I'm just a fan of really terrible jokes.

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, they were pretty funny, but I guess the crowd just didn't appreciate his sense of humor.

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But you know what?

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They did use quite a lot of really interesting language, so why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Language Takeaway.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
On Language Takeaway, we're going to be looking at six words today, so let's get started.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The announcer welcomed everyone and said that it's open mic night.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Open mic night.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So an open mic night.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, we know mic is short for microphone, right?

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now, an open mic night is a chance where anyone can come up and talk into the microphone.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you can come up and sing, or you can tell jokes.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You can do anything, basically.

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yep.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Open mic.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's not for professionals, but for people who maybe want to be professionals.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Amateurs.

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So it was open mic night, and he said they had a lot of great comics there.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So comics.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A comic.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A comic.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So basically, a comic is a person that makes a living by making people laugh.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, someone who stands up on stage and tells jokes.

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Would you say a clown is kind of like a comic?

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, they're different.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They're different, right?

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A comic doesn't wear a red nose and a crazy costume.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
All right.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, because I hate clowns.

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We do know that about you.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All right.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So a comic.

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And well, what comics do is they perform stand-up comedy.

147
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Stand-up comedy.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stand-up comedy.

149
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, so stand-up comedy is really exactly what its name suggests, right?

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right.

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You stand up in front of an audience, and you tell jokes, or you make them laugh.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, tell funny stories.

153
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a very popular form of entertainment in the United States and the UK.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's right.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that at the end of the lesson.

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But why don't we move on to our next word, which is routine.

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
A routine.

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So the guy says, I've been working on my routine.

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So what does he mean by his routine?

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, I guess a routine is like a series or a collection of jokes or maybe movements that you use in a performance.

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
All right, a routine.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So you can talk about a dance routine.

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Or in this case, a comedy routine.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So the series of jokes he's going to tell.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's right, that he practices again and again and again.

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All right.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And in his routine, he said he's got a lot of zingers, zingers, a zinger.

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So what's a zinger?

169
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Basically a zinger is like a strong, maybe a little bit rude joke.

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, but like a kind of a one line joke, right?

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Exactly.

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And the people that were in the crowd and they were booing him, they're like, boo, those we call hecklers.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Exactly.

175
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And that's our last word.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A heckler.

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
A heckler.

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hecklers.

179
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So let's listen to some hecklers in action.

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right, well, I think that's pretty clear.

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Those are definitely hecklers.

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Right.

183
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They're very annoying.

184
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So now that we've finished looking at all the words that are related to comedy and performances, let's take a look at the jokes now in Fluency Builder.

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Fluency Builder.

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
OK, well, we're not really focusing on new phrases for you here, but we thought it would be helpful to talk a little bit about the jokes to help you understand them.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right.

188
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Because they are, well, I think pretty funny.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah, they're pretty funny, but maybe sometimes they're kind of hard to understand.

190
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So why don't we start with the first joke?

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So you said, where do you find a one legged dog?

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So what's a one legged dog?

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Basically it's a dog that has one leg.

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
OK.

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the pronunciation here is important, right?

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
One legged.

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Not one legged.

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No.

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
One legged.

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So you can say one legged dog, a two legged dog or a three legged dog.

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Six legged dog?

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A six legged spider maybe lost two legs in a war.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, dear.

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
OK, so the dog obviously didn't go anywhere, and so that's why you find it where you left it.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Exactly.

206
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So that's why it's kind of funny.

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
OK.

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
All right.

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So then he said, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know.

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
A cloud, basically because, you know, sheep are fluffy and they're white.

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So if you take away their legs, they look like a little cloud.

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All right.

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's look at the next one.

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He asked, what do cows do for entertainment?

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And then the answer was they rent movies.

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Exactly.

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So it's kind of funny because he's relating this word movies with what the with the sound that cows make, which is moo.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And actually, there are a million jokes in English following the same pattern.

221
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

222
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So I'm sure you can find a lot more of them and you can share them with us.

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Now, my personal favorite joke is the guy says, what does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

224
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So to run into a wall basically is to crash against the wall.

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah.

226
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So what does the fish say?

227
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Damn.

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So why is this funny?

229
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why does it say damn?

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, because I mean, if you if you if you're a person and you run into a wall, damn, like, you know, just like, oh, no.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But a fish is swimming under the water.

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Like we saw a dam is actually like a wall in the water.

233
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So he's saying like, oh, a wall.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So it's that I like that one.

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
All right.

238
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The last one was pretty good.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

240
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
OK, so the big holes in their nose.

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right.

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And basically, it's because they have big fingers so they can put their fingers in the nose.

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, exactly.

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh dear.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If the gorilla didn't have big nostrils, he wouldn't be able to pick his nose.

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Maybe he'd have to use a stick.

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, but that wouldn't be convenient.

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
See.

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

250
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So that's why those jokes are funny.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They're very short jokes.

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Of course, some of them are not actually really funny, but it's just a little bit of a taste of short American jokes.

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
OK, well, I think we need to hear them one more time in context so you can all know how funny or maybe not so funny they are.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Open Mic Night.

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're in for a real treat as we've got a lot of great comics here with us tonight.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
First up, we have a very funny man coming straight from the state of Montana, Robert Hicks.

257
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Thank you, everyone.

258
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, what a lovely crowd.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You know, there's nothing I love better than stand up comedy.

260
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You know, I've been working on my routine for months now and I've got some real zingers for you tonight.

261
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's start out with some short jokes.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How about that?

263
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Where do you find a one legged dog?

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Where you left it.

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Get it?

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Anyways, what do you call a sheep with no legs?

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A cloud.

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Tough crowd.

269
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
All right.

270
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Now, you're going to love this joke.

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's hilarious.

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What do cows do for entertainment?

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They rent movies, movies.

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
OK, OK, OK, we've got a OK, we've got a few hecklers in the audience, but this one is good.

275
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What does a fish say when it runs into a wall?

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Damn.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
OK, OK, OK, OK, last one.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why do gorillas have big nostrils?

279
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Because they got big fingers.

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Thanks, everyone.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That was my time.

282
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000

Don't come with me.

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, no swears.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No swearing in the jokes.

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yep.

Bye.
