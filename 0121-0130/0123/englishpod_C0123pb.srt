00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And today we're looking at another one of our lessons for English of the past decades, and this time it's the 1990s.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, you know, the 1990s is a little easier for most of us to remember.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, I guess it's a little bit more recent.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to be looking at a lot of language that is still used today.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Most of these words and phrases are still used today, so they're going to be very useful and you're going to sound a lot more native.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A lot cooler as well, huh?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Right, so before we get started with this lesson, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now the first one is a mall.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A mall.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
M-A-L-L, mall.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alright, so a mall is basically short for shopping mall.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And a shopping mall is a big building with many stores inside.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right, so it's like a shopping center.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And our last word for vocabulary preview is gang.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The gang.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The gang.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, so a gang is a group of people, right?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah, it's a group of people you can call your friends, the gang.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're going to go out with the gang tonight.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yep.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now we sometimes hear this word and it has a negative meaning, right?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right, like street gangs.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, so people who fight and deal drugs and all that sort of stuff.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Right, so it can have a negative and a positive meaning, but it just depends on how you use it.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But in the dialogue we'll hear it with a positive meaning.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Right.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So that's all the words we have for vocabulary preview.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's listen to this cool and hip dialogue from the 1990s and we'll come back later and explain some words.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Better be getting mad props from the gang, man.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dude, don't even go there.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're such a player, man.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Dude, there's Mad Max.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's go say hi.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hey, Max, what's up?

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you okay?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You look like you just saw a ghost.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I got an F in English class.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My life is over.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Dude, you're over it.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Come on, let's bounce.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Where are we going?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, crap.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to open the can of whoop-ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, okay.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Gee.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, it sounds like this guy's got some problems at school, huh?

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, he got an F on his paper, but you always can count on your friends to try and cheer you up by doing something.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But they use some really great phrases and vocabulary words, so why don't we look at those now in Language Takeaway?

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
All right, on Language Takeaway, we're going to be looking at five words, and well, let's start with the first one.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So the guy was talking about his really cool new shoes, his new Adidas, right?

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And his friend said, those are dope.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dope.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Dope.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, so it's pretty easy to understand when something is dope.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's really awesome.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's cool.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, it's great.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Right, it's great.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, that's dope.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And it's an adjective, right?

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So his friend said those are dope, and he said, you're going to be getting mad props from the gang.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, so mad props.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mad props.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We can divide this word in two, so let's take a look at the first part.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mad.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mad.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So we understand that mad is angry, right?

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, but it can also mean a lot, right?

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Or really.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So if I say you have mad skills.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're really good at something.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Or you can say, she has a mad amount of shoes.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
All right, so he's going to get mad props.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now props is like respect or compliments.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, so his shoes are so cool that he's going to get a lot of respect or a lot of compliments from his friends.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Exactly.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mad props.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mad props.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So they started talking about girls, and he mentioned that this girl started trippin'.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Trippin'.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Trippin'.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, to trip.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Right, as you notice, it's trippin'.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It doesn't have the G at the end, which isn't really grammatically correct, but that's kind of the way it's pronounced.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, we would never say the G.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So if somebody is trippin'.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They're, um, they're getting really upset.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They're getting really angry.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They're causing trouble.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use trippin' for different situations.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Example one.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Leanne was trippin' because I got dirt on her car.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Example two.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Even though I apologize for calling her fat, Jeannie was trippin' all night.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Example three.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He sent me 43 text messages and called me about 20 times.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That guy is trippin' over me.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, so that's pretty clear.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Trippin'.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Alright.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now, moving on to our next word.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They wanted to go somewhere, and he said, come on, let's bounce.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's bounce.

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's bounce.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm gonna bounce.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, uh, bounce basically means let's leave.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's get out of here.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But we might be more familiar with this word as in, like, a ball, right?

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A ball bounces off the floor.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So I guess it's kind of the same.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You kind of bounce off the floor and leave that place.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's bounce.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, so for our final word, now this guy who got a bad mark on his paper, he was nervous about what his dad would say, right?

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Because his dad was going to go postal.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He said my dad is gonna go postal.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
To go postal.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now, if you go postal, it means you go crazy.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, you really freak out.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You get very angry.

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, like really angry.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This word comes from the 90s because during a time it was very common in the United States that postal workers, mailmen, were going a little bit crazy and, you know, they started shooting people and delivering some strange packages.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, I guess so people who work in the post office maybe don't have the most exciting jobs and that drives them a little crazy.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But now they have a term named after them.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hey, four eyes.

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's up, man?

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How have you been?

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Not bad.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Check out my new Adidas.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Those are dope.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dude, don't even go there.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's right.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You are such a player, man.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Dude, there's Mad Max.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go say hi.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Max, what's up?

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you okay?

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You look like you just saw a ghost.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I got an F in English class.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My life is over.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Dude, you're over it.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come on, let's bounce.

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Where are we going?

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, crap.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm going to open the can of whoop-ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, okay.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Jeez.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay, so I think that was a little easier to understand.

175
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You know, we've got a lot of pretty strange words and phrases, some interesting slang.

176
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, and I want to take a look at this slang now, so let's get started with Fluency Builder.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Fluency Builder.

178
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay, so the guy with the new shoes, he asked his friends, have you seen Betty lately, right?

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Right.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And his friend replied, don't even go there.

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Right, he was like, dude, don't even go there.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't even go there.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So what does he mean when he says don't even go there?

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He means don't talk about it.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't want to talk about it.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right, don't even touch that subject.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't even mention it.

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right, so if somebody wants to talk about a topic that you think is sensitive or you don't want to talk about it, just say, hey, don't even go there.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So Marco, what do you think about the new tax law?

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't even go there.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't even want to talk about politics.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, so I think that's a really actually quite helpful phrase to avoid talking about an uncomfortable subject.

193
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Right, so he said don't even go there and he started talking about the girl and she was tripping and then he said something interesting.

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He said, I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, I really like this phrase.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Now I want to focus on the first part.

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was like, I was like, I was like.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Now you might hear a lot of native English speakers use these three words before they start telling you what they said.

199
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So it's like saying I said or I told him.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yep.

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So this actually is really common, especially with people under the age of 30.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So why don't we hear a few more examples of how it's used now.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Example one.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This guy caused a car accident.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was like, you idiot, you can kill people by driving like that.

206
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Example two.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then I was like, I hate you.

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And she was all like, I hate you more.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Example three.

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I told the teacher that I didn't finish my homework and he was like, I'll see you after school.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So if you're telling a story or you're maybe talking to somebody and you want to explain what you said, you can say, I was like, hey, what are you doing?

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And she was like, what?

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So you can have an entire dialogue based with, I was like, she was like, we were like, okay, so I was like, it's super, super useful.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So now our next word.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Now they saw their friend who got the bad mark in school and the guy said, dude, get over it.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Get over it.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Get over it.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So if somebody tells you to get over it.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Stop worrying about it.

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Or stop thinking about it.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
All right.

223
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So if somebody is sad because maybe his girlfriend broke up with him, you would say, get over it.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Stop thinking about it.

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Let it go.

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's in the past.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And you, you commonly use this for when somebody is upset about a small thing, something they shouldn't worry about.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Get over it.

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yep.

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Now, why don't we go on to our final word?

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
At the end of the dialogue, they said, I'm going to open a can of whoop ass.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So to open a can of whoop ass on somebody.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
To open a can of whoop ass.

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So again, let's break this down before we explain it.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think we have to take one step back here.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
To whoop someone's ass is to beat them up, right?

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
To punch them and hurt them.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Right.

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So to whoop somebody's ass.

243
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So if I open a can of whoop ass, what does that mean?

244
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It means you're going to beat them up.

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So it's just a funny, very informal way of saying like in this can, I'm going to open it and I'm going to start hitting you or something like that.

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Some sort of small man is going to jump out of the can and start hitting you.

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Exactly.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But it's never literal.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's not like you're actually going to beat somebody up.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's just kind of like...

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's kind of a joke.

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's an empty threat.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yeah.

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All right.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So some really interesting words and phrases in this dialogue.

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I think we should listen to it for the last time.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this great decade.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hey, Four Eyes, what's up, man?

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
How have you been?

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Not bad.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Check out my new Adidas.

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Those are dope.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

266
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Dude, don't even go there.

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's right.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You are such a player, man.

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Dude, there's Mad Max.

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's go say hi.

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Max, what's up?

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you OK?

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You look like you just saw a ghost.

276
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I got an F in English class.

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
My life is over.

278
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Dude, you're over it.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Come on, let's bounce.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Where are we going?

282
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, crap.

283
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

284
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm going to open the can of whoop ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
OK, OK.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Geez.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, Marco, in the dialog, I heard one of the guys say, what's up?

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But he said it in a really strange way, didn't he?

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, exactly.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He said, what's up?

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
OK, so what's up with that?

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So in the 90s, it was popular instead of saying what's up, you would just kind of double the S and just say what's up.

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then it became very famous with a TV commercial for a certain beer.

294
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And actually, I remember this commercial during the Super Bowl.

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
They had this big commercial where everyone was saying what's up in this really strange way.

296
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right.

297
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's still used today informally between friends.

298
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You'll go, hey, what's up, what's up?

299
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah.

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You'll use it.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah.

302
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So that commercial made it actually quite cool and famous to talk like that.

303
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Actually, in SpanishPod, they have a show called Que Pasa, which is like the translation of what's up.

304
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
All right.

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They start each show with like saying Que Pasa, but it's exactly the same.

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So maybe it will become popular in Spanish.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Maybe.

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But I guess only time will tell.

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, that's right.

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
All right.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So really cool stuff.

312
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And as we heard typical music from the 90s and another interesting thing was the nicknames for eyes, Mad Max, very popular among young kids.

313
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,000

Bye.
