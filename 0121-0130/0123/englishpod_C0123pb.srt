00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,059
Hello everyone, welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:07,820
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:08,919
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:17,699
And today we're looking at another one of our lessons for English of the past decades, and this time it's the 1990s.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,660
Well, you know, the 1990s is a little easier for most of us to remember.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,839
Yeah, I guess it's a little bit more recent.

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,320
We're going to be looking at a lot of language that is still used today.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Most of these words and phrases are still used today, so they're going to be very useful and you're going to sound a lot more native.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,460
A lot cooler as well, huh?

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,060
Right, so before we get started with this lesson, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,420
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,219
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

13
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,899
Now the first one is a mall.

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,539
A mall.

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,079
M-A-L-L, mall.

16
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,399
Alright, so a mall is basically short for shopping mall.

17
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,519
And a shopping mall is a big building with many stores inside.

18
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,540
Right, so it's like a shopping center.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,680
And our last word for vocabulary preview is gang.

20
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,060
The gang.

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,120
The gang.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,859
Okay, so a gang is a group of people, right?

23
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,739
Yeah, it's a group of people you can call your friends, the gang.

24
00:01:21,859 --> 00:01:23,500
We're going to go out with the gang tonight.

25
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:23,799
Yep.

26
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,640
Now we sometimes hear this word and it has a negative meaning, right?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,739
Right, like street gangs.

28
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,079
Yeah, so people who fight and deal drugs and all that sort of stuff.

29
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:40,540
Right, so it can have a negative and a positive meaning, but it just depends on how you use it.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,939
But in the dialogue we'll hear it with a positive meaning.

31
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:43,379
Right.

32
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,120
So that's all the words we have for vocabulary preview.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:54,480
Let's listen to this cool and hip dialogue from the 1990s and we'll come back later and explain some words.

34
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,680
Better be getting mad props from the gang, man.

35
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,699
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,340
Dude, don't even go there.

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,139
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

38
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,099
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

39
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:43,300
That's right.

40
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,620
You're such a player, man.

41
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,879
Dude, there's Mad Max.

42
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,500
Let's go say hi.

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,080
Hey, Max, what's up?

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,060
Are you okay?

45
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,080
You look like you just saw a ghost.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,379
I got an F in English class.

47
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,919
My life is over.

48
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,219
Dude, you're over it.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,259
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,620
Come on, let's bounce.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,860
Where are we going?

52
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,060
Oh, crap.

53
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,500
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

54
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,340
I'm going to open the can of whoop-ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,620
Okay, okay.

56
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:23,639
Gee.

57
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:34,219
Well, it sounds like this guy's got some problems at school, huh?

58
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:41,139
Yeah, he got an F on his paper, but you always can count on your friends to try and cheer you up by doing something.

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,580
Yeah.

60
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,460
But they use some really great phrases and vocabulary words, so why don't we look at those now in Language Takeaway?

61
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:51,479
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:58,819
All right, on Language Takeaway, we're going to be looking at five words, and well, let's start with the first one.

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,400
So the guy was talking about his really cool new shoes, his new Adidas, right?

64
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,460
And his friend said, those are dope.

65
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,460
Dope.

66
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,139
Dope.

67
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,080
Okay, so it's pretty easy to understand when something is dope.

68
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,560
It's really awesome.

69
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,120
It's cool.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,199
Yeah, it's great.

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,220
Right, it's great.

72
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,639
So, that's dope.

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,339
And it's an adjective, right?

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,199
So his friend said those are dope, and he said, you're going to be getting mad props from the gang.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,879
Okay, so mad props.

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,800
Mad props.

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,519
We can divide this word in two, so let's take a look at the first part.

78
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:34,160
Mad.

79
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:34,879
Mad.

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,120
So we understand that mad is angry, right?

81
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
Yeah, but it can also mean a lot, right?

82
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:41,399
Or really.

83
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,120
So if I say you have mad skills.

84
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,660
You're really good at something.

85
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,139
Or you can say, she has a mad amount of shoes.

86
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,079
All right, so he's going to get mad props.

87
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,180
Now props is like respect or compliments.

88
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,879
Yeah, so his shoes are so cool that he's going to get a lot of respect or a lot of compliments from his friends.

89
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,620
Exactly.

90
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:03,800
Mad props.

91
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,019
Mad props.

92
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:12,079
So they started talking about girls, and he mentioned that this girl started trippin'.

93
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:13,500
Trippin'.

94
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,779
Trippin'.

95
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,500
So, to trip.

96
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,759
Right, as you notice, it's trippin'.

97
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,639
It doesn't have the G at the end, which isn't really grammatically correct, but that's kind of the way it's pronounced.

98
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah, we would never say the G.

99
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:26,899
Right.

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,579
So if somebody is trippin'.

101
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,000
They're, um, they're getting really upset.

102
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,399
They're getting really angry.

103
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,079
They're causing trouble.

105
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,300
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use trippin' for different situations.

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,519
Example one.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,740
Leanne was trippin' because I got dirt on her car.

108
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,959
Example two.

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,879
Even though I apologize for calling her fat, Jeannie was trippin' all night.

110
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:00,980
Example three.

111
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,160
He sent me 43 text messages and called me about 20 times.

112
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,360
That guy is trippin' over me.

113
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,740
Okay, so that's pretty clear.

114
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,480
Trippin'.

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Alright.

116
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,560
Now, moving on to our next word.

117
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,180
They wanted to go somewhere, and he said, come on, let's bounce.

118
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,060
Let's bounce.

119
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,040
Let's bounce.

120
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm gonna bounce.

121
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,519
Now, uh, bounce basically means let's leave.

122
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,100
Yeah.

123
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,939
Let's get out of here.

124
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,399
But we might be more familiar with this word as in, like, a ball, right?

125
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,259
A ball bounces off the floor.

126
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,920
So I guess it's kind of the same.

127
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,420
You kind of bounce off the floor and leave that place.

128
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:41,839
Yeah.

129
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's bounce.

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,439
Okay, so for our final word, now this guy who got a bad mark on his paper, he was nervous about what his dad would say, right?

131
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,180
Right.

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,199
Because his dad was going to go postal.

133
00:06:55,899 --> 00:06:58,660
He said my dad is gonna go postal.

134
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,779
To go postal.

135
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,560
Now, if you go postal, it means you go crazy.

136
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,279
Yeah, you really freak out.

137
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,199
You get very angry.

138
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,779
Yeah, like really angry.

139
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:22,560
This word comes from the 90s because during a time it was very common in the United States that postal workers, mailmen, were going a little bit crazy and, you know, they started shooting people and delivering some strange packages.

140
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,740
Well, I guess so people who work in the post office maybe don't have the most exciting jobs and that drives them a little crazy.

141
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,139
But now they have a term named after them.

142
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,120
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time.

143
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,959
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back.

144
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,459
Hey, four eyes.

145
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
What's up, man?

146
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,519
How have you been?

147
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,139
Not bad.

148
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,180
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

149
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,199
Check out my new Adidas.

150
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Those are dope.

151
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,639
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

152
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,720
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

153
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,420
Dude, don't even go there.

154
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,199
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

155
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,180
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

156
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,339
That's right.

157
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,620
You are such a player, man.

158
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,959
Dude, there's Mad Max.

159
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,540
Let's go say hi.

160
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,160
Max, what's up?

161
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,680
Are you okay?

162
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,139
You look like you just saw a ghost.

163
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,440
I got an F in English class.

164
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,940
My life is over.

165
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,779
Dude, you're over it.

166
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,779
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

167
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Come on, let's bounce.

168
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,419
Where are we going?

169
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,600
Oh, crap.

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,059
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

171
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,840
I'm going to open the can of whoop-ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

172
00:08:59,340 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay, okay.

173
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:01,000
Jeez.

174
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,120
Okay, so I think that was a little easier to understand.

175
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,799
You know, we've got a lot of pretty strange words and phrases, some interesting slang.

176
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,820
Yeah, and I want to take a look at this slang now, so let's get started with Fluency Builder.

177
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,960
Fluency Builder.

178
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:25,399
Okay, so the guy with the new shoes, he asked his friends, have you seen Betty lately, right?

179
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,039
Right.

180
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,539
And his friend replied, don't even go there.

181
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,419
Right, he was like, dude, don't even go there.

182
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,559
Don't even go there.

183
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,320
So what does he mean when he says don't even go there?

184
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,019
He means don't talk about it.

185
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:39,559
I don't want to talk about it.

186
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,639
Right, don't even touch that subject.

187
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,539
Don't even mention it.

188
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:49,960
Right, so if somebody wants to talk about a topic that you think is sensitive or you don't want to talk about it, just say, hey, don't even go there.

189
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,899
So Marco, what do you think about the new tax law?

190
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,279
Don't even go there.

191
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't even want to talk about politics.

192
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:03,779
Okay, so I think that's a really actually quite helpful phrase to avoid talking about an uncomfortable subject.

193
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:11,360
Right, so he said don't even go there and he started talking about the girl and she was tripping and then he said something interesting.

194
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:16,840
He said, I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

195
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,659
Yeah, I really like this phrase.

196
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,419
Now I want to focus on the first part.

197
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,120
I was like, I was like, I was like.

198
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,240
Now you might hear a lot of native English speakers use these three words before they start telling you what they said.

199
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,879
So it's like saying I said or I told him.

200
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,299
Yep.

201
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:44,399
So this actually is really common, especially with people under the age of 30.

202
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,179
So why don't we hear a few more examples of how it's used now.

203
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:49,980
Example one.

204
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,440
This guy caused a car accident.

205
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:57,440
I was like, you idiot, you can kill people by driving like that.

206
00:10:59,019 --> 00:10:59,899
Example two.

207
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,799
And then I was like, I hate you.

208
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,019
And she was all like, I hate you more.

209
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,440
Example three.

210
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,179
I told the teacher that I didn't finish my homework and he was like, I'll see you after school.

211
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,299
So if you're telling a story or you're maybe talking to somebody and you want to explain what you said, you can say, I was like, hey, what are you doing?

212
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,320
And she was like, what?

213
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:35,340
So you can have an entire dialogue based with, I was like, she was like, we were like, okay, so I was like, it's super, super useful.

214
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,539
So now our next word.

215
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:43,600
Now they saw their friend who got the bad mark in school and the guy said, dude, get over it.

216
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,039
Get over it.

217
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:45,860
Get over it.

218
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,799
So if somebody tells you to get over it.

219
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,700
Stop worrying about it.

220
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,220
Okay.

221
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,200
Or stop thinking about it.

222
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:53,659
All right.

223
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,919
So if somebody is sad because maybe his girlfriend broke up with him, you would say, get over it.

224
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,179
Stop thinking about it.

225
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:01,740
Let it go.

226
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,639
It's in the past.

227
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,139
Yeah.

228
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,980
And you, you commonly use this for when somebody is upset about a small thing, something they shouldn't worry about.

229
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,399
Get over it.

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,600
Yep.

231
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,440
Now, why don't we go on to our final word?

232
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,940
At the end of the dialogue, they said, I'm going to open a can of whoop ass.

233
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:18,659
Okay.

234
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:21,940
So to open a can of whoop ass on somebody.

235
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,679
To open a can of whoop ass.

236
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,580
So again, let's break this down before we explain it.

237
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:27,019
Okay.

238
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,120
I think we have to take one step back here.

239
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,379
To whoop someone's ass is to beat them up, right?

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,580
To punch them and hurt them.

241
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,059
Right.

242
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,840
So to whoop somebody's ass.

243
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,620
So if I open a can of whoop ass, what does that mean?

244
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,240
It means you're going to beat them up.

245
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,320
So it's just a funny, very informal way of saying like in this can, I'm going to open it and I'm going to start hitting you or something like that.

246
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,000
Some sort of small man is going to jump out of the can and start hitting you.

247
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,539
Exactly.

248
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,659
But it's never literal.

249
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:59,320
It's not like you're actually going to beat somebody up.

250
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,840
It's just kind of like...

251
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,200
It's kind of a joke.

252
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,500
It's an empty threat.

253
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:02,840
Yeah.

254
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,799
All right.

255
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,980
So some really interesting words and phrases in this dialogue.

256
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,740
I think we should listen to it for the last time.

257
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,580
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this great decade.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,120
Hey, Four Eyes, what's up, man?

259
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,639
How have you been?

260
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,080
Not bad.

261
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,039
Just went to the mall and picked up some junk.

262
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,759
Check out my new Adidas.

263
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,580
Those are dope.

264
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,220
You are going to be getting mad props from the gang, man.

265
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,259
Anyways, have you seen Betty lately?

266
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,980
Dude, don't even go there.

267
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,759
That girl started tripping because I went to the movies with Veronica the other day.

268
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,820
I was like, look, you knew how I was before you got with me.

269
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:02,919
That's right.

270
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,200
You are such a player, man.

271
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,480
Dude, there's Mad Max.

272
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,139
Let's go say hi.

273
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,679
Max, what's up?

274
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,659
Are you OK?

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
You look like you just saw a ghost.

276
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:18,019
I got an F in English class.

277
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,519
My life is over.

278
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,840
Dude, you're over it.

279
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,879
You need to lay off the books for a while and have some fun.

280
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,259
Come on, let's bounce.

281
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,480
Where are we going?

282
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:30,659
Oh, crap.

283
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,080
My dad is going to go postal when he finds out about this.

284
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,879
I'm going to open the can of whoop ass on you if you don't come with me right now.

285
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,159
OK, OK.

286
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,279
Geez.

287
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,279
Well, Marco, in the dialog, I heard one of the guys say, what's up?

288
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,580
But he said it in a really strange way, didn't he?

289
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,700
Yeah, exactly.

290
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,159
He said, what's up?

291
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,100
OK, so what's up with that?

292
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,820
So in the 90s, it was popular instead of saying what's up, you would just kind of double the S and just say what's up.

293
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,340
And then it became very famous with a TV commercial for a certain beer.

294
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,980
And actually, I remember this commercial during the Super Bowl.

295
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,820
They had this big commercial where everyone was saying what's up in this really strange way.

296
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,100
Right.

297
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,799
It's still used today informally between friends.

298
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,659
You'll go, hey, what's up, what's up?

299
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:31,980
Yeah.

300
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,080
You'll use it.

301
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,279
Yeah.

302
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,679
So that commercial made it actually quite cool and famous to talk like that.

303
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:42,360
Actually, in SpanishPod, they have a show called Que Pasa, which is like the translation of what's up.

304
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:42,840
All right.

305
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:47,460
They start each show with like saying Que Pasa, but it's exactly the same.

306
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,059
So maybe it will become popular in Spanish.

307
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:50,539
Maybe.

308
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,080
But I guess only time will tell.

309
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:53,820
Yeah, that's right.

310
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:54,500
All right.

311
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,059
So really cool stuff.

312
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:04,559
And as we heard typical music from the 90s and another interesting thing was the nicknames for eyes, Mad Max, very popular among young kids.

313
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:12,759
So remember, if you have any questions about this language or anything else about this lesson, come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

314
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,259
Right.

So thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.

317

Bye.
