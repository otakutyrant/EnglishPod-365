00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we're bringing you part two of the presidential farewell speech of President Eisenhower.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we saw in a previous lesson the beginning of this speech.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now we're going to look towards the end of the speech.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now we must tell you as well that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We changed it a little bit to make it a little bit more comprehensible, and also we did shorten it.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The speech isn't this short.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We did take out a lot of stuff.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All right.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So again, Marco, why are we looking at this speech?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What are we learning from it?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, in this last part of the presidential farewell speech, there are a lot of great words that are more difficult and very poetic, so you can use them in different formal circumstances or just to sound a little bit more well-spoken.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And we also, again, are going to look at some really quite difficult and challenging structures that we hope you can use maybe when you're giving a formal talk or, yeah, or even in your writing if you want to sound quite professional.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Very good.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's listen how President Eisenhower says goodbye, and then we'll come back and look at the words.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Three of these involved our own country.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and the most productive nation in the world.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied, that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full, that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings, that those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities, that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity, that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I am proud to do so.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I look forward to it.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thank you, and good night.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, that certainly was a very moving speech, hey?

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Very moving, and to a certain point, a little bit religious, huh?

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, I think we'll talk a little bit about that a little bit later, but let's concentrate on the language now, so we'll go to Language Takeaway.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Language Takeaway.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we'll start with our first word, and it's preeminence.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right, we are understandably proud of this preeminence.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A preeminence.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, preeminence, what is this?

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Basically, it's the state of being the leader of something.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, so in this case, America was the preeminent nation.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right, so they were coming up, they were very prosperous, so they had a preeminence in the world.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right, so I think we can see here, you can use this as an adjective, a preeminent nation, or as a noun, an uncountable noun, the preeminence of our state.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Very good.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Since we can use this word as a noun and an adjective, why don't we listen to some more examples, so we can get a better understanding of it.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Example one.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now please welcome Dr.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Frank Hicks, the world's most preeminent expert on nuclear biology.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Example two.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's been a leader in his field for 25 years, and his preeminence has never been questioned.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Example three.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Carol Dixon is one of the most preeminent experts in green technology.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right, well, Eisenhower was talking about all of the things that the American people had done since they became a free nation, and one of these things was to foster progress in human achievement.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Foster progress in human achievement.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, I like this verb a lot, to foster something.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So if I say to foster progress or to foster something, what am I saying?

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
To help something grow and develop.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
To take care of it, to nurse it.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We very commonly hear this word associated with children, right?

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A foster child.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, so what's that?

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If you have a foster child, you are basically taking care of a child because the parents can't look after them.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not like adopting because it's not actually legal.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's just that you're helping somebody out by raising this child.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right, so we can see the connection there, a foster child, to foster something.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But you know, this is really a great word, and I think it would help to give a couple of examples of how we could use it.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
For example, I can say, our company is looking to foster better creativity in the workplace.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Or we could say, here at Praxis Language, we foster the development of your English.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Very good.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So the word foster.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now, moving on, in his speech, he was talking about nations and faiths and different types of groups, and he said, all who yearn for freedom.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All right, this is a great phrase.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All who yearn for freedom.

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To yearn.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So to yearn for something.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, if I yearn for freedom, or I yearn for something, it's basically that I really want it in my heart.

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, you really wish for it in a way that's almost painful, you know?

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You want it so badly.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now, you wouldn't say like, I'm yearning for ice cream, would you?

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, unless you were locked up in prison and hadn't had ice cream for 55 years.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So it's usually related to something that's very difficult to get or something like freedom or yearning for.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's really important.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Exactly.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Something very important.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And now for our last word, President Eisenhower was talking about charity.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He was talking about freedom, and he mentioned the scourges of poverty.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, so scourges.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The scourges of poverty.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Scourges is a really difficult but interesting word.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So why don't we hear a few more examples to help us understand it?

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Example one.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Malaria is a disease that continues to be a scourge to the developing world.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Example two.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
One day we hope to eliminate the scourge of cancer.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Example three.

97
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
NATO promises to wipe out the scourge of terrorism.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So as we can see, the scourges of something basically is the cause of pain or suffering.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So now relating it back to the text, we see scourges of poverty.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, scourges of poverty, scourges of disease, and scourges of ignorance.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right, so we can see that poverty, ignorance, and disease cause a lot of really terrible things, right?

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Exactly.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So that's why we say they are scourges.

104
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, so scourges.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now, that brings us to the end of our words for takeaway today.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But, you know, as we talked about earlier, we've got some really difficult and interesting structures to look at now in Fluency Builder.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Fluency Builder.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, so in Fluency Builder, we'll start off with the very first sentence of the paragraph when he said, we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so I love this phrase.

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of the century.

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now, it's interesting because he is making reference to the future in the present.

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And he's using a great phrase to do that.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We now stand.

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now, we can change it a little bit and use the first part, we now stand, in different circumstances.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples?

116
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Example one.

117
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We now stand before you to declare our love and be united in marriage.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Example two.

119
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I stand before this court and declare my innocence.

120
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Example three.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Together, we now stand before this great challenge and we will fight arm in arm to defeat poverty.

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
All right, so you can see that this is a wonderful phrase to use maybe in a formal speech, right?

123
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right, or a wedding again, or a formal ceremony.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So, and it gives you this idea, this sort of very poetic image of people sort of almost standing at the cliff, standing before the, you know, some big change that's about to take place.

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So 10 years past the midpoint of a century, the United States has witnessed four major wars, right?

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And well, he said, despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and most productive nation in the world.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, so a great, great, great structure here.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America today is the strongest, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Right.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Now, let's look at that first word, despite the carnage of these conflicts.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, so carnage, what's that?

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Carnage is like a massacre, right?

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where many people got hurt or killed.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, so a pretty violent situation when a lot of people died.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And now why does he use this word despite?

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay, so he's basically saying, even though we had all of this death and violence in this century, we're still the greatest nation, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Exactly, that's exactly it.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can say, for example, despite the economic crisis the world is going through, our company has an enormous opportunity to grow and be more profitable.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay, or if we want to take it and imagine we're at a wedding, we might say something like this.

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You could say, despite the many difficulties this couple has faced, they have a very bright and happy future together.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Very good.

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And now if we take a look at the last paragraph, it's very interesting because it's one sentence.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a really long sentence.

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a very long sentence.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So even though it's not a phrase, let's take a look at the punctuation of this paragraph.

148
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay, so Eisenhower starts out by saying, we pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations may have their great human needs satisfied.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And then we have a semicolon there, right?

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So why do we have a semicolon?

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, here's what he's doing.

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He's saying, we pray for something.

154
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then he's listing the many different things that he's praying for.

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, so it's basically a list.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yep.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay, so we know that when you're writing a list, we commonly use commas between all the things that are in this list.

158
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But here, because they are long and complex ideas, a comma is not enough, right?

159
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You need a semicolon.

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, so we can see here from the text that the semicolon is a great way to separate ideas, big ideas, complex ideas in a list.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Exactly.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So you can use it and not necessarily have to end your sentence or that each idea become one sentence.

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can all just make it in one big sentence.

164
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yep.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, and actually, I remember back to high school, Marco, my teacher told me, hey, if you throw in a few semicolons into your writing and do it properly, you'll really impress people.

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All right, so this is good advice that you can take and throw in a couple of semicolons, a little bit of commas here and there, and it'll look like you really know how to write.

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yep.

168
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay, so with that in mind, why don't we listen to what Eisenhower wrote one last time?

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.

170
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Three of these involved our own country.

171
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and the most productive nation in the world.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

173
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations.

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied.

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings.

177
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities.

178
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity.

179
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

181
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

182
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I am proud to do so.

183
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I look forward to it.

184
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Thank you, and good night.

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
All right, we're back and we're here again with Pete, our voice actor for the second part of the dialogue.

186
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And Pete, we have a couple more questions for you today.

187
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I hear in Eisenhower's speech that he keeps referencing God.

188
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like he keeps saying, I pray, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He said, Godspeed, blah, blah, blah, blah.

190
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So what's up with that?

191
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Why is he talking about God?

192
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, this is a very interesting question.

193
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Traditionally, America has had a really clear boundary between church and state.

194
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And you'll hear a lot of rhetoric these days that says, you know, we're a Christian nation and we were founded as a Christian nation.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, that's baloney.

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Baloney.

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's not true.

198
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
At the time when the country was founded 200 years ago, it was overwhelmingly Christian.

199
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If the founding fathers, as we call them, like George Washington and them, if they had wanted a Christian nation, they could have had it.

200
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They explicitly did not.

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And a lot of people since then have gotten that confused.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And now when we have a very large Muslim population, we have Buddhists, we have, you know, people in all various different kinds of, you know, Mormonism and everything, it's even less possible now.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So I'm kind of baffled when I hear people say that America is a Christian nation.

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But you even have it now in the coins, like, or on the money, right?

205
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It says in God we trust.

206
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Right.

207
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That that started in the early 20th century.

208
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I think that was Teddy Roosevelt era.

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He opposed that.

210
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Roosevelt was really opposed to that.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And then what happened?

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
They approved it.

213
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah.

214
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And, you know, people said later, like Eisenhower talking about this stuff, you know, in America, we have something called the Pledge of Allegiance, which I don't think you guys probably have.

215
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Not in Canadian.

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Obviously, you wouldn't do it to America, but to your own.

217
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's kind of like a salute to the flag, right?

218
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yeah, it's a little bit nationalist.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I did it growing up.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You put your hand over your heart and you face the flag and you say, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

222
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That part about one nation under God that was added in the 50s as a kind of a way of showing that America is not, quote unquote, a godless communist country.

223
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wow.

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, because communism teaches, you know, no religion.

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And so they said, make sure we're not communist.

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
OK, but we don't think that, right?

227
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah.

228
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I mean, I'm I'm all about tolerance, so I think that's kind of absurd.

229
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:30,000
OK, so what I think is really interesting, though, is that every political speech, every time a political leader has to say something publicly, he'll always quote God.

230
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Right.

231
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Right.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And they'll often end a speech with, you know, thank you and God bless America or something.

233
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, exactly.

234
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Which, you know, for me as a Canadian is really strange.

235
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like if if a Canadian president said God bless Canada, no one would know what to do.

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yeah, I don't I don't know.

237
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Anyway, I had an ex-girlfriend who was British and she like Tony Blair started with that a couple times.

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
He said, you know, and God bless us all or something.

239
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And she was just put off by it.

240
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
And she was like, the Brits will never take this.

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And they didn't.

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No one was impressed.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,000
All right.

244
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Well, an interesting feature of American history, politics and society.

245
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So thanks for that insight, Pete.

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Cool.

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
My pleasure.

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yeah.

249
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And if you guys have any comments or any suggestions about this lesson or any upcoming lessons, just let us know.

I'll try to stop in on the forum and see if I can answer a question or two.

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,000
