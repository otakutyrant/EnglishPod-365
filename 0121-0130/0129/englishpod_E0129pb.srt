00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,179
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:06,879
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,879
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,300
And today we're bringing you part two of the presidential farewell speech of President Eisenhower.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,259
That's right.

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,199
So we saw in a previous lesson the beginning of this speech.

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,760
Now we're going to look towards the end of the speech.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,399
Now we must tell you as well that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,480
We changed it a little bit to make it a little bit more comprehensible, and also we did shorten it.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,260
The speech isn't this short.

12
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,240
We did take out a lot of stuff.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:32,780
All right.

14
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,840
So again, Marco, why are we looking at this speech?

15
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:36,979
What are we learning from it?

16
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, in this last part of the presidential farewell speech, there are a lot of great words that are more difficult and very poetic, so you can use them in different formal circumstances or just to sound a little bit more well-spoken.

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:50,280
Yeah.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:01:04,019
And we also, again, are going to look at some really quite difficult and challenging structures that we hope you can use maybe when you're giving a formal talk or, yeah, or even in your writing if you want to sound quite professional.

19
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:04,579
Okay.

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,099
Very good.

21
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,900
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time?

22
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:13,859
Let's listen how President Eisenhower says goodbye, and then we'll come back and look at the words.

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:25,719
We now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,599
Three of these involved our own country.

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,319
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and the most productive nation in the world.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:54,500
We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

27
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:07,819
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:47,759
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied, that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full, that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings, that those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities, that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity, that the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,400
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

30
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,360
I am proud to do so.

31
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,800
I look forward to it.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,539
Thank you, and good night.

33
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,020
Well, that certainly was a very moving speech, hey?

34
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:06,180
Very moving, and to a certain point, a little bit religious, huh?

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,539
Yeah, I think we'll talk a little bit about that a little bit later, but let's concentrate on the language now, so we'll go to Language Takeaway.

36
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,300
Language Takeaway.

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,879
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we'll start with our first word, and it's preeminence.

38
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,159
All right, we are understandably proud of this preeminence.

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,960
A preeminence.

40
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,659
So, preeminence, what is this?

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,060
Basically, it's the state of being the leader of something.

42
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,319
Okay, so in this case, America was the preeminent nation.

43
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:46,039
Right, so they were coming up, they were very prosperous, so they had a preeminence in the world.

44
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:56,580
All right, so I think we can see here, you can use this as an adjective, a preeminent nation, or as a noun, an uncountable noun, the preeminence of our state.

45
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,620
Very good.

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:05,780
Since we can use this word as a noun and an adjective, why don't we listen to some more examples, so we can get a better understanding of it.

47
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,419
Example one.

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,060
Now please welcome Dr.

49
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,639
Frank Hicks, the world's most preeminent expert on nuclear biology.

50
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,279
Example two.

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,600
He's been a leader in his field for 25 years, and his preeminence has never been questioned.

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,199
Example three.

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,579
Carol Dixon is one of the most preeminent experts in green technology.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:45,379
All right, well, Eisenhower was talking about all of the things that the American people had done since they became a free nation, and one of these things was to foster progress in human achievement.

55
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,579
Foster progress in human achievement.

56
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:51,579
Well, I like this verb a lot, to foster something.

57
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,060
So if I say to foster progress or to foster something, what am I saying?

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,879
To help something grow and develop.

59
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,019
To take care of it, to nurse it.

60
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:05,519
We very commonly hear this word associated with children, right?

61
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,639
A foster child.

62
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,779
Yeah, so what's that?

63
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:15,000
If you have a foster child, you are basically taking care of a child because the parents can't look after them.

64
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,680
It's not like adopting because it's not actually legal.

65
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,480
It's just that you're helping somebody out by raising this child.

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,660
Right, so we can see the connection there, a foster child, to foster something.

67
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,680
But you know, this is really a great word, and I think it would help to give a couple of examples of how we could use it.

68
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,040
For example, I can say, our company is looking to foster better creativity in the workplace.

69
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,300
Or we could say, here at Praxis Language, we foster the development of your English.

70
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,379
Very good.

71
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,459
So the word foster.

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Now, moving on, in his speech, he was talking about nations and faiths and different types of groups, and he said, all who yearn for freedom.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800
All right, this is a great phrase.

74
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,060
All who yearn for freedom.

75
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,879
To yearn.

76
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,500
So to yearn for something.

77
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, if I yearn for freedom, or I yearn for something, it's basically that I really want it in my heart.

78
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,339
Yeah, you really wish for it in a way that's almost painful, you know?

79
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,100
You want it so badly.

80
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,139
Now, you wouldn't say like, I'm yearning for ice cream, would you?

81
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,160
No, unless you were locked up in prison and hadn't had ice cream for 55 years.

82
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,500
So it's usually related to something that's very difficult to get or something like freedom or yearning for.

83
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,740
That's really important.

84
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,459
Exactly.

85
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,620
Something very important.

86
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:42,980
And now for our last word, President Eisenhower was talking about charity.

87
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,680
He was talking about freedom, and he mentioned the scourges of poverty.

88
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:49,759
Okay, so scourges.

89
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,220
The scourges of poverty.

90
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,560
Scourges is a really difficult but interesting word.

91
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,740
So why don't we hear a few more examples to help us understand it?

92
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,600
Example one.

93
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,279
Malaria is a disease that continues to be a scourge to the developing world.

94
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,319
Example two.

95
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,199
One day we hope to eliminate the scourge of cancer.

96
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,759
Example three.

97
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,500
NATO promises to wipe out the scourge of terrorism.

98
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:27,579
So as we can see, the scourges of something basically is the cause of pain or suffering.

99
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,319
So now relating it back to the text, we see scourges of poverty.

100
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,240
Yeah, scourges of poverty, scourges of disease, and scourges of ignorance.

101
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,000
All right, so we can see that poverty, ignorance, and disease cause a lot of really terrible things, right?

102
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,600
Exactly.

103
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,779
So that's why we say they are scourges.

104
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,319
Okay, so scourges.

105
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,540
Now, that brings us to the end of our words for takeaway today.

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,680
But, you know, as we talked about earlier, we've got some really difficult and interesting structures to look at now in Fluency Builder.

107
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,819
Fluency Builder.

108
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:11,759
Okay, so in Fluency Builder, we'll start off with the very first sentence of the paragraph when he said, we now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century.

109
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,459
Okay, so I love this phrase.

110
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,600
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of the century.

111
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,660
Now, it's interesting because he is making reference to the future in the present.

112
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,959
And he's using a great phrase to do that.

113
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,519
We now stand.

114
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:34,659
Now, we can change it a little bit and use the first part, we now stand, in different circumstances.

115
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,299
So why don't we listen to a couple of examples?

116
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,039
Example one.

117
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,720
We now stand before you to declare our love and be united in marriage.

118
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:47,139
Example two.

119
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,659
I stand before this court and declare my innocence.

120
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,980
Example three.

121
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,460
Together, we now stand before this great challenge and we will fight arm in arm to defeat poverty.

122
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,519
All right, so you can see that this is a wonderful phrase to use maybe in a formal speech, right?

123
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,179
Right, or a wedding again, or a formal ceremony.

124
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:10,620
Yeah.

125
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:21,080
So, and it gives you this idea, this sort of very poetic image of people sort of almost standing at the cliff, standing before the, you know, some big change that's about to take place.

126
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,980
So 10 years past the midpoint of a century, the United States has witnessed four major wars, right?

127
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,519
Okay.

128
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:38,200
And well, he said, despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and most productive nation in the world.

129
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,039
Okay, so a great, great, great structure here.

130
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,559
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America today is the strongest, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

131
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:45,840
Right.

132
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,159
Now, let's look at that first word, despite the carnage of these conflicts.

133
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,639
Okay, so carnage, what's that?

134
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Carnage is like a massacre, right?

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,299
Where many people got hurt or killed.

136
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,980
Okay, so a pretty violent situation when a lot of people died.

137
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,879
And now why does he use this word despite?

138
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:14,220
Okay, so he's basically saying, even though we had all of this death and violence in this century, we're still the greatest nation, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

139
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,639
Exactly, that's exactly it.

140
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:24,220
I can say, for example, despite the economic crisis the world is going through, our company has an enormous opportunity to grow and be more profitable.

141
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Okay, or if we want to take it and imagine we're at a wedding, we might say something like this.

142
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,620
You could say, despite the many difficulties this couple has faced, they have a very bright and happy future together.

143
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:36,340
Very good.

144
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,580
And now if we take a look at the last paragraph, it's very interesting because it's one sentence.

145
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
It's a really long sentence.

146
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,659
It's a very long sentence.

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,139
So even though it's not a phrase, let's take a look at the punctuation of this paragraph.

148
00:10:51,759 --> 00:11:01,399
Okay, so Eisenhower starts out by saying, we pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations may have their great human needs satisfied.

149
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,919
And then we have a semicolon there, right?

150
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,279
Right.

151
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,000
So why do we have a semicolon?

152
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:07,820
Well, here's what he's doing.

153
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:10,100
He's saying, we pray for something.

154
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,860
And then he's listing the many different things that he's praying for.

155
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,639
Okay, so it's basically a list.

156
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:18,159
Yep.

157
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,700
Okay, so we know that when you're writing a list, we commonly use commas between all the things that are in this list.

158
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,059
But here, because they are long and complex ideas, a comma is not enough, right?

159
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,139
You need a semicolon.

160
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:41,600
Okay, so we can see here from the text that the semicolon is a great way to separate ideas, big ideas, complex ideas in a list.

161
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,440
Exactly.

162
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,899
So you can use it and not necessarily have to end your sentence or that each idea become one sentence.

163
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,139
You can all just make it in one big sentence.

164
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:51,419
Yep.

165
00:11:51,840 --> 00:12:01,279
You know, and actually, I remember back to high school, Marco, my teacher told me, hey, if you throw in a few semicolons into your writing and do it properly, you'll really impress people.

166
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:11,000
All right, so this is good advice that you can take and throw in a couple of semicolons, a little bit of commas here and there, and it'll look like you really know how to write.

167
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,440
Yep.

168
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,460
Okay, so with that in mind, why don't we listen to what Eisenhower wrote one last time?

169
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:29,840
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.

170
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,720
Three of these involved our own country.

171
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:41,419
Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential, and the most productive nation in the world.

172
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:58,559
We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America's leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.

173
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:11,919
Throughout America's adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress and human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations.

174
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:19,419
We pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied.

175
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,919
That those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full.

176
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,320
That all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings.

177
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,539
That those who have freedom will understand also its heavy responsibilities.

178
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,580
That all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity.

179
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,899
That the scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth.

180
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:51,860
And that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.

181
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,500
Now, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

182
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,440
I am proud to do so.

183
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,879
I look forward to it.

184
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,639
Thank you, and good night.

185
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,600
All right, we're back and we're here again with Pete, our voice actor for the second part of the dialogue.

186
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,519
And Pete, we have a couple more questions for you today.

187
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,139
So I hear in Eisenhower's speech that he keeps referencing God.

188
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,700
Like he keeps saying, I pray, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

189
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:24,840
He said, Godspeed, blah, blah, blah, blah.

190
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,620
So what's up with that?

191
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,899
Why is he talking about God?

192
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,720
Well, this is a very interesting question.

193
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:34,620
Traditionally, America has had a really clear boundary between church and state.

194
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:40,240
And you'll hear a lot of rhetoric these days that says, you know, we're a Christian nation and we were founded as a Christian nation.

195
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,179
Well, that's baloney.

196
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,139
Baloney.

197
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,120
So it's not true.

198
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:48,200
At the time when the country was founded 200 years ago, it was overwhelmingly Christian.

199
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,580
If the founding fathers, as we call them, like George Washington and them, if they had wanted a Christian nation, they could have had it.

200
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,340
They explicitly did not.

201
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,740
And a lot of people since then have gotten that confused.

202
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:10,659
And now when we have a very large Muslim population, we have Buddhists, we have, you know, people in all various different kinds of, you know, Mormonism and everything, it's even less possible now.

203
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,539
So I'm kind of baffled when I hear people say that America is a Christian nation.

204
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:18,700
But you even have it now in the coins, like, or on the money, right?

205
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,100
It says in God we trust.

206
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:20,779
Right.

207
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,399
That that started in the early 20th century.

208
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:24,820
I think that was Teddy Roosevelt era.

209
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,720
He opposed that.

210
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,940
Roosevelt was really opposed to that.

211
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,960
And then what happened?

212
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,019
They approved it.

213
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:29,759
Yeah.

214
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:37,559
And, you know, people said later, like Eisenhower talking about this stuff, you know, in America, we have something called the Pledge of Allegiance, which I don't think you guys probably have.

215
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:38,860
Not in Canadian.

216
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,299
Obviously, you wouldn't do it to America, but to your own.

217
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,159
It's kind of like a salute to the flag, right?

218
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,279
Yeah, it's a little bit nationalist.

219
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:47,519
I did it growing up.

220
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:55,320
You put your hand over your heart and you face the flag and you say, I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands.

221
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,000
One nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

222
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:08,840
That part about one nation under God that was added in the 50s as a kind of a way of showing that America is not, quote unquote, a godless communist country.

223
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,440
Wow.

224
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,820
Yeah, because communism teaches, you know, no religion.

225
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,600
And so they said, make sure we're not communist.

226
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:16,960
OK, but we don't think that, right?

227
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah.

228
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,980
I mean, I'm I'm all about tolerance, so I think that's kind of absurd.

229
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:30,799
OK, so what I think is really interesting, though, is that every political speech, every time a political leader has to say something publicly, he'll always quote God.

230
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,320
Right.

231
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:31,799
Right.

232
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,059
And they'll often end a speech with, you know, thank you and God bless America or something.

233
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,840
Yeah, exactly.

234
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,399
Which, you know, for me as a Canadian is really strange.

235
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:47,919
Like if if a Canadian president said God bless Canada, no one would know what to do.

236
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,559
Yeah, I don't I don't know.

237
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,139
Anyway, I had an ex-girlfriend who was British and she like Tony Blair started with that a couple times.

238
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,759
He said, you know, and God bless us all or something.

239
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,360
And she was just put off by it.

240
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,700
And she was like, the Brits will never take this.

241
00:16:58,899 --> 00:16:59,460
And they didn't.

242
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,480
No one was impressed.

243
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:02,279
All right.

244
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,359
Well, an interesting feature of American history, politics and society.

245
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,079
So thanks for that insight, Pete.

246
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:09,500
Cool.

247
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,000
My pleasure.

248
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,359
Yeah.

249
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:16,160
And if you guys have any comments or any suggestions about this lesson or any upcoming lessons, just let us know.

250

Or American politics in general.

251
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,799
I'll try to stop in on the forum and see if I can answer a question or two.

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,519
That would be awesome.
