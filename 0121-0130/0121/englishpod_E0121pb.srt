00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,080
Welcome back to another advanced lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,099
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,119
And my name's Erika.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,640
So today we're bringing you another advanced lesson, and this time it's kind of historical.

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:23,160
Like the name suggests, we are listening in as a president says goodbye to the nation before he steps down from his role as president.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,280
Now, actually this dialogue is very much based on President Eisenhower's Farewell speech.

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:30,960
Oh, okay.

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,359
So a pretty, pretty famous.

10
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,539
Now, we have to tell you that we did change the speech a little bit, right?

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,820
Yeah, just a little bit to make it a little bit more understandable, but it's basically what he said to the nation back in 1969.

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,500
All right, now I will as well tell you that this is a pretty hard dialogue.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,759
It is very hard because the structures are a little bit complicated and even to a certain point a little bit poetic, right?

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,820
So why are we taking this speech as our dialogue?

15
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:01,340
What are we going to learn from this?

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:11,079
Well, we're going to learn some structures and some words that you can use maybe on a resignation letter or maybe in a celebration you want to thank Pete for coming.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:21,480
Okay, so we're going to learn some pretty difficult vocabulary, but also learn some really useful structures like you said you could use in a resignation letter or even in a formal speech of your own.

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,280
Exactly.

19
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:26,620
Now, this presidential farewell speech is divided into two parts.

20
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,260
So today we're going to do part one and then next time we'll finish the speech with part two.

21
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,480
So let's listen to President Eisenhower as he says goodbye to the nation and we'll come back just in a little bit.

22
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,659
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:02:00,159
Three days from now, after a century of service to our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,340
This evening I come to you with a message of leave taking and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,280
Like every other citizen, I wish the new president and all who will labor with him Godspeed.

26
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,639
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

27
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:32,460
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation.

28
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:41,900
My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when long ago a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point.

29
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,960
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during the war and the immediate post-war period.

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,819
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we've had during these past eight years.

31
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,879
Wow, so Eisenhower is a pretty good speaker, isn't he?

32
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,060
A good speaker and, well, he said a lot of really nice things when he was saying goodbye.

33
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,900
Yeah, pretty inspiring, I thought.

34
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,139
Really inspiring.

35
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:19,379
And as we said, there were a couple of different and difficult words and phrases, so why don't we start right now with language takeaway?

36
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,219
Language takeaway.

37
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:29,400
Well, Eisenhower said that in three days he shall lay down the responsibilities.

38
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,560
To lay down the responsibilities.

39
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,699
Alright, lay down something.

40
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,020
Basically, we understand the verb, to lay down, right?

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,460
To put it down, to put it on the ground.

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:41,860
Right.

43
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:50,919
Now, he's using it with responsibilities, which is a little bit strange, but it's kind of like a metaphor by saying lay down arms, to lay down your weapons.

44
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:59,020
Right, and you know what, this is a really common phrase that we would hear, especially when we're talking about the end of a war or something like that.

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,400
To lay down your arms, lay down your weapons.

46
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:08,599
Yeah, so here I think Eisenhower is kind of referencing this and giving us a little bit of poetry in his speech.

47
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:14,620
Right, so it's not that he's quitting, it's not that he's being fired, he's just finishing what he started.

48
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,319
Yes, so he's laying down his responsibilities.

49
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,459
Now, I think this would be quite an interesting phrase to use, for example, in a resignation letter.

50
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:28,560
Right, so I would say, a month from now I will lay down my responsibilities as manager.

51
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,100
Yep.

52
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,620
Alright, so that sounds pretty good.

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, he said he's going to be laying down the responsibilities in a traditional and solemn ceremony.

54
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,100
Alright, solemn.

55
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,100
Solemn.

56
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,639
Now, solemn, what does that mean?

57
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,120
What is a solemn ceremony?

58
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,500
Well, a solemn ceremony would be a serious, respectful, and a little bit sad ceremony.

59
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,399
Okay, so it's a serious matter, and it's very respectful, right?

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:05,180
Yeah, so you might say, for example, on the 11th of November, when you're remembering the war, you might say something like, this is a very solemn day.

61
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,079
Very good.

62
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,660
Okay, and the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

63
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,660
Okay, so interesting verb, no wait, so interesting word, vested.

64
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,939
Vested.

65
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,160
The authority vested in my successor.

66
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,160
Very good.

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,579
So this word basically means power that I have by law.

68
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:34,139
Right, so this power, this important power you have is given to you by the law, by the president, by the country.

69
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:45,360
This is a very common word you will hear in a wedding, when the priest or the person that's leading the wedding will say, by the power vested in me by the state of California.

70
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,480
Yep, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

71
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,620
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

72
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:54,680
So you're saying the power that I have given to me by the state of California, I can now make you be married.

73
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,899
So here, Eisenhower is saying, the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

74
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:08,220
So the power of the presidency will be given to his, given to the next, next president by law.

75
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,899
Exactly.

76
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,180
And he also wished the new president and everyone with him, he said, Godspeed.

77
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,040
Alright, Godspeed.

78
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,620
Godspeed.

79
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,839
I wish you Godspeed.

80
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,800
Now, Godspeed, what does that mean?

81
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:29,060
Well, it's kind of a blessing, you know, it basically means good luck and good fortune.

82
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,600
Alright, and especially in a journey.

83
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,100
Yeah, I think you'd almost only use this when someone's going off on a big trip or a journey.

84
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,939
So here they're going on the journey of the presidency.

85
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,360
So I wish you Godspeed.

86
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,240
Godspeed.

87
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:44,759
Very good.

88
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,439
And now let's take a look at our last set of words.

89
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:56,000
When he was talking about Congress, he said that his relation with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis.

90
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Alright, so two interesting words here, remote and tenuous.

91
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,079
Now, remote we understand as being far away or distant.

92
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,199
Yeah, what about tenuous, though?

93
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,300
But tenuous is kind of unimportant or not really relevant.

94
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,139
Alright, so actually, this is a pretty high quality, useful and smart sounding word.

95
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,300
So I think we should hear a few more examples of how it's used.

96
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,079
Example one.

97
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,019
How can you say the earth is actually getting cooler?

98
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,060
That is a pretty tenuous argument.

99
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,980
Example two.

100
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,300
John believes that Elvis Presley is still alive.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,660
He's got a tenuous hold on reality.

102
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,439
Example three.

103
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,680
You're making yourself seem more important than you are.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,699
The connection between our company's success and your performance is tenuous at best.

105
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,720
Alright, so as we said, these are some pretty difficult words that we found in the dialogue.

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,560
But now I want to go and look at some really interesting formal structures that Eisenhower used here.

107
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,560
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

108
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:13,920
Fluency Builder Alright, on Fluency Builder today we have three phrases and starting with the first one, I think it's one of the most interesting ones.

109
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:22,779
He said, three days from now, after half a century of service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office.

110
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:25,420
Alright, so what's interesting about this?

111
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:38,559
If you take a look at the structure, he's saying three days from now, which is future, and then he makes a reference to the past, after a half century of service.

112
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,080
Okay, so we've got future past.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,299
And then again future, I shall lay down the responsibilities.

114
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:54,200
Alright, so this actually is quite a good structure if you're giving a farewell speech or even I could imagine using this at a wedding.

115
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,980
Right, how would you use it in a wedding?

116
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:05,139
I might say, twelve hours from now, after a long and beautiful relationship, this couple shall marry.

117
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,259
Very good, so you're making reference to the future and then a past event or something that's been going on for a while.

118
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,940
And then future again.

119
00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:14,100
Why don't we do one more example?

120
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:28,779
So for example, in a resignation letter, I can say one month from now, after 30 years of hard work and dedication to this company, I shall lay down my responsibilities as product manager.

121
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,919
Alright, interesting.

122
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,139
So we can use it and it sounds good, it sounds very professional and...

123
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:34,980
And very poetic.

124
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,639
Very poetic, it sounds nice.

125
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,419
Alright, so that's one interesting structure.

126
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:46,539
Now why don't we go on to this next kind of very formal and helpful in a very formal speech.

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:54,720
Well, President Eisenhower said, This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell.

128
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:59,360
So this evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell.

129
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,820
So it's a very nice way of saying, I'm talking to you today because I am saying goodbye.

130
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,159
Yes, so what I really like about this phrase is the beginning part.

131
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,220
This evening I come to you with a message of...

132
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,740
So again, let's suppose we're at a wedding.

133
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:24,220
If I'm offering a toast or I'm the best man, I could say, This evening I come to you with a message of love and trust and respect.

134
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:32,019
Alright, or maybe if you're the leader of a company, you might say something like, This afternoon I come to you with a message of hope for the future.

135
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,000
Very good.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,840
And now the part when he says leave-taking and farewell, it's basically saying taking leave or taking like a vacation, right?

137
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,100
And farewell is goodbye.

138
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,500
And what about our last phrase?

139
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,360
This is actually a bit of a long one, so I'm going to read it now.

140
00:10:49,179 --> 00:11:02,379
Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation.

141
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,240
Okay, great.

142
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,059
Now let's take a look at the first part.

143
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:12,059
Basically he's saying the people expect the President and the Congress to give them answers, right?

144
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,940
Yeah, to agree on important issues.

145
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,100
But in the part when he says, The wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation.

146
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:23,759
Yeah, and this is the part I want to focus on.

147
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,840
The wise resolution of which.

148
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,480
Now this is a really wonderful sort of formal structure.

149
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
So we can see what he's doing here.

150
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,179
He's talking about the first idea, right?

151
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:40,379
So the President and the Congress need to find agreement on important issues, right?

152
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,720
Now the wise resolution of which.

153
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,919
So he's referring back to that idea.

154
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,259
So the wise resolution of what?

155
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,000
Of the essential agreement on questions of great importance.

156
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,320
Right, so really useful structure.

157
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,340
Why don't we hear a few more examples of this?

158
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,379
We now face a great challenge, the overcoming of which lead us all to untold riches and success.

159
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,519
Example two.

160
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,240
We as a company now face our most difficult months to date, the outcome of which will determine our company's future.

161
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,740
Example three.

162
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:31,759
The ambitious plan to reduce poverty, the start of which was launched last Tuesday in New York, will require a huge investment of taxpayers' dollars.

163
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:42,120
All right, so as you can hear from the examples, we have the main idea and then he passes on but then kind of refers back to it again.

164
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,200
Yeah, and this sounds quite formal but also quite literary and intelligent, doesn't it?

165
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,039
Yeah, it makes you sound well-spoken.

166
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,440
Very good.

167
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,720
This was quite a difficult dialogue with some really interesting and tricky structures and words.

168
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,500
So why don't we hear it one more time altogether?

169
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,600
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

170
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:20,120
Three days from now, after a century of service to our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor.

171
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:28,299
This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.

172
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,220
Like every other citizen, I wish the new president and all who will labor with him Godspeed.

173
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,320
I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.

174
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:52,399
Our people expect their president and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation.

175
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:01,860
My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point.

176
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:08,899
I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationships with Congress during the war and the immediate post-war period.

177
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:15,740
Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we've had during these past eight years.

178
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:29,779
All right, we're back, and here with us in the studio we have Pete, the actor in the dialogue of President Eisenhower's presidential farewell speech.

179
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,460
He's a pretty convincing actor at that.

180
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,100
Not quite.

181
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,019
So Pete is going to give us a little bit of insight about President Eisenhower.

182
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,500
All right, so what can you tell us about President Eisenhower?

183
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,980
Well, he started off as a general.

184
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:52,980
He was an accomplished officer all through the early 20th century, and then he was the supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II.

185
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,840
And so now he's most famous for D-Day.

186
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:57,500
He was leading it?

187
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,419
Or he was on the battlefield?

188
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,340
No, he was the organizer.

189
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,659
Oh, he's kind of like the brains behind the operation.

190
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:23,679
Yeah, and I don't know if you even want to leave this in, but there's a really cool document that he wrote right before the invasion, and it said he basically knew that this was going to go one of two ways, and he wrote down a script to read in case it failed, and he basically said, you know, I'm sorry to inform you that the invasion did not go as planned, and this has set back our war effort.

191
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,299
And when the invasion went well, he threw that in the trash, and then one of his aides found that and was like, wow, this is a historical document, and they kept the...

192
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:30,860
Oh, really?

193
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:31,139
Yeah.

194
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,259
So they have the copy.

195
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,059
Alternate history.

196
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,159
All right, so he was an accomplished general, an amazing warrior, but what about his presidency?

197
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:52,620
Well, at the beginning, probably the biggest thing he did was to wrap up the Korean War, which was a vow he made during his campaign, and then he visited Korea.

198
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:57,039
Obviously, the war is still technically on, but they did arrange a ceasefire.

199
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:07,840
Eisenhower built up the interstate highway system, which is one of the big reasons that America was able to become economically successful in the 20th century.

200
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:14,600
He did it basically so that in case of a war, we'd have an easy way of shipping our soldiers and nukes across the country.

201
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,000
But it worked well anyway.

202
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,279
Yeah, it's one of these things that pays a side benefit.

203
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,320
At least he had to sell it to the country that way.

204
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,000
It's very likely that he didn't intend ever to use it that way, but, you know, you have to have...

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,860
It's like the war on terror.

206
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,740
You've got to sell these things.

207
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:39,259
Well, and I guess it's had a huge impact not only on the economy of the states, but also the culture and the way that people view the car and its effect on society.

208
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:39,820
Definitely.

209
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,120
So a pretty influential guy, this Eisenhower.

210
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,779
Yeah, and a very historical lesson.

211
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,539
It's just a little bit of a culture and maybe some insight on American history.

212
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:58,600
It's not like we're politically active or anything, but yeah, it was some interesting information there, and also he was considered to be a pretty good president.

213
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,460
Yeah, he's rated, I wouldn't say among the top five or so, but quite accomplished.

214
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:10,819
Well, maybe not the greatest president we've ever seen, but he wrote a pretty good farewell speech, so I think we have that to thank him for.

215
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,940
All right, guys, so if you have any other questions or comments, you can come to the website at EnglishPod.com, and you can leave them there for Erika or I.

216
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,900
Okay, so thanks for downloading, you guys, and until next time, goodbye.

217
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,599
Bye.
