1
00:00:02,599 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,219
Welcome to another lesson at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,380
My name is Katherine.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,380
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,359
Today, we're going to be talking about a popular topic all over the world, and that is smoking.

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,120
Well, not so popular in the States right now, to be honest.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,100
Well, that's the thing.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:28,699
In every country in the world now, they are becoming more strict on smoking and where you can smoke, so it's becoming very difficult for smokers nowadays.

10
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,160
Well, it's a good reason to want to quit.

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,920
And that's what we're going to be talking about today is quitting smoking.

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,979
Well, before we get going, we do have a really important phrase that we should preview in today's vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,140
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,840
All right, so on vocabulary preview, we're going to take a look at this word, pack of smokes.

15
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:50,640
Pack of smokes.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,560
So...

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,420
A pack of smokes.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,320
So, smokes is a word for cigarettes.

19
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,740
It's the same thing, smokes or cigarettes.

20
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,200
Right.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,439
But a pack is, you know, like 20 cigarettes.

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,719
It's a box of cigarettes.

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,099
You buy them in a pack.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,719
You don't just buy one at a time.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,599
So again, the phrase is pack of smokes.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,599
Pack of smokes.

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,579
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what's going on with this smoker.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,519
Ah, it smells like an ashtray in here.

29
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,400
Hi, honey.

30
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,540
What's wrong?

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,420
Why do you have that look on your face?

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,519
What's wrong?

33
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,620
I thought we agreed you were going to quit smoking.

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,319
No.

35
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:40,480
I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

36
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,540
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

37
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,719
Look, there are other ways to quit.

38
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,099
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,819
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

40
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,560
It's not like you can just light up like before.

41
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,840
I know, I know.

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,120
I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,759
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch.

44
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,240
Please understand.

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,159
Fine.

46
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,219
I want a divorce.

47
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,580
Sorry, I just smoked a pack of cigarettes.

48
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,860
You do smoke, don't you?

49
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:27,400
Well, we'll talk about that later.

50
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:28,300
All right.

51
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,240
So it is a little bit extreme, though.

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,780
I mean, he's divorcing her because she won't quit.

53
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:42,460
Well, some people really are health conscious and are afraid of the negative side of smoking, which has a lot of health side effects.

54
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:52,960
Well, as he was complaining about all the negative effects and the negative aspects of smoking, he did mention, both of them mentioned a lot of great words and phrases.

55
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:56,300
So why don't we take a look at them now in Language Takeaway?

56
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,039
Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:09,300
Well, this first word is a word that's very important for any smoker who goes to a bar or restaurant and needs to put the ash somewhere, right?

58
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,180
So when you smoke, there's some ash, there's some messy, dirty stuff, and you need an ash tray to collect it.

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,439
An ash tray.

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,599
So an ash tray is something that's usually round or square and you put it on a table and it's just very helpful to keep the house clean or restaurant clean.

61
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,759
So if you're in a restaurant, you say, hey, can I have an ash tray, please?

62
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:34,060
So the residue or the stuff that when you're smoking, it comes out the gray, I don't know, like dust.

63
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,020
It's called ash.

64
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:35,659
Right.

65
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:36,960
And this is a tray.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,240
But the complaint here is, oh, it smells like an ash tray in here.

67
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,139
That means it smells really, really bad in here.

68
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,460
Yeah, it smells like cigarettes.

69
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,219
Yeah.

70
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,419
So that word again is ashtray.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,219
Ashtray.

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,659
All right.

73
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,139
Well, and the guy was complaining and he said, well, I thought you were going to quit smoking.

74
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,800
And she said, no, no, I said I was going to cut down.

75
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,159
She says it's very different from quitting smoking.

76
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,900
So Marco, maybe we should talk about how cutting down and quitting are different.

77
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,360
All right.

78
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,080
So if I say I'm going to cut down on smoking, it's just I'm going to smoke less.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,819
OK, so let's take an example.

80
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,360
I smoke 10 cigarettes a day, but I want to cut down.

81
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,860
How many should I smoke later?

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,180
Maybe like two or three, two or three instead of quitting.

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,240
So if you quit smoking, that would mean zero, zero cigarettes, no smoking anymore.

84
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:30,680
Right.

85
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:31,319
All right.

86
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,660
So you can also cut down on carbs like carbohydrates.

87
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,060
So some people who cut down on carbs eat less bread.

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,839
They don't eat any pasta.

89
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,699
So these are really good ways of trying to talk about dieting as well as smoking.

90
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,160
And I think we have a couple of examples of other ways we can use this phrase cut down.

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,259
So let's listen to them now.

92
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,079
Example one.

93
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:59,180
Our company has decided to cut down our workload.

94
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,699
So from now on, we leave at 3 p.m.

95
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,540
every Friday.

96
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:04,860
Example two.

97
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,560
You should really cut down on the amount of salt you eat.

98
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,959
It's not good for you.

99
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,639
Example three.

100
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,379
My doctor told me I need to cut down on fatty foods because of my heart condition.

101
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,879
And when you want to smoke a cigarette, you have to do something first with some fires.

102
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,560
We call this lighting up.

103
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,980
To light up.

104
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:33,120
So lighting up, it doesn't mean turning on the light.

105
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,519
It actually means using a lighter or some fire to start your cigarette.

106
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:38,040
Right.

107
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,699
So you want to light up with the lighter matches or some sort of fire.

108
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,939
The man says, the husband says, it's not like you can just light up like before.

109
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,300
That means it's not like you can just smoke like before.

110
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:52,360
So in some cases, light up means to smoke a cigarette.

111
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,959
We're in a movie theater and someone lights a cigarette and I say, oh, you can't light up in here.

112
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:57,420
Right.

113
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,720
So you can't smoke in here.

114
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,379
You can't smoke in here.

115
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:00,680
It's another way of saying smoking.

116
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,120
Very good.

117
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,079
And she was explaining, you know, how difficult it is and she's trying to quit, but she said, I don't have the willpower to just quit.

118
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,180
Ooh, willpower.

119
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,480
So this is an important word.

120
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,480
Willpower.

121
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:14,079
Willpower.

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,779
You think of the main part of this word is will.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,040
That means the desire to do something.

124
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,199
You want to do something.

125
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,779
So if I have willpower, I have strong willpower, what am I saying?

126
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,660
You're saying that you can make a decision and you can follow your decision.

127
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,040
So I decide not to eat cake.

128
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,899
I have very strong willpower, so I never eat cake.

129
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,279
If I don't have strong willpower, maybe I sometimes secretly eat cake in the middle of the night from my refrigerator.

130
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,660
So that happens, right?

131
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:48,740
Sometimes you don't have a strong enough willpower, so you kind of eat a little bit of cake.

132
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,980
Nobody's watching.

133
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,519
And you can have willpower about lots of different things.

134
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:58,699
So this is a great word, again, to use when you're talking about dieting or smoking or drinking.

135
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,399
Any type of maybe temptation.

136
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,180
Exactly.

137
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:01,959
All right.

138
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,160
And well, she said she had this urge to reach for her pack of smokes.

139
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,019
Ooh, urge is another good one.

140
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:15,860
It's very similar to willpower, but an urge is kind of like a physical feeling that makes you want to do something.

141
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,879
So you have like this strong desire.

142
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,040
So I have the urge to go swimming today.

143
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,939
I don't know why, but I really want to.

144
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,379
All right.

145
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,279
You have an urge.

146
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:25,680
Interesting word.

147
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,980
Pregnant women often have these kinds of things, too.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,319
I have the urge to do something.

149
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,819
We also call them cravings.

150
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,339
Oh, cravings or urge to do something.

151
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,079
All right.

152
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:34,560
Interesting.

153
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,680
So we've taken a look at these five great words, and I think we should listen to our dialogue again.

154
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,860
We're going to slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

155
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:53,459
Oh, it smells like an ashtray in here.

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,560
Hi, honey.

157
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,079
What's wrong?

158
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,579
Why do you have that look on your face?

159
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,019
What's wrong?

160
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,839
I thought we agreed that you were going to quit smoking.

161
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,980
No, I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

162
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,019
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

163
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,220
Look, there are other ways to quit.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,480
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

165
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:28,379
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month, and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

166
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,759
It's not like you can just light up like before.

167
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:32,820
I know.

168
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,600
I know.

169
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,559
I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

170
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,860
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch.

171
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,620
Please understand.

172
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:47,480
Fine.

173
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,120
I want a divorce.

174
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,080
And we are back.

175
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,399
So we have a great part of our show where we like to talk about some phrases that help you attain fluency.

176
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,960
That means sounding like a native speaker of English, and today's phrases are wonderful.

177
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,419
All right, so let's take a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

178
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,539
So on Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at two different phrases, and let's start with the first one.

179
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,340
She mentioned something about going cold turkey overnight.

180
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,179
What is that phrase?

181
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,399
Cold turkey.

182
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,200
Now, this is a very strange phrase, okay?

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,700
So first of all, why would a turkey be cold?

184
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,759
They have lots of feathers.

185
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,659
And second of all, what does it have to do with cigarettes?

186
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:31,200
Right.

187
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,100
So if I say I'm going cold turkey, what is that?

188
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:35,860
So just take this as a phrase.

189
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,100
Don't think about the actual words because they won't make sense in this context.

190
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,220
What we're talking about is quitting smoking entirely.

191
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,320
You're not going to cut down.

192
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,419
That means today I'm not going to smoke at all, and I'm never going to smoke again.

193
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,840
That means never ever will I smoke another cigarette.

194
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,059
So it's cold turkey.

195
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,639
So if I go cold turkey means I stop doing something immediately and suddenly and forever.

196
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,379
Entirely.

197
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,820
Alright.

198
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,159
So you can use this phrase for different habits, different things that you do, like drinking for example, or cutting down on sugar.

199
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,580
But generally we just say this about cigarettes.

200
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,500
So it's mostly related to smoking.

201
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:14,919
Yeah.

202
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,200
Going cold turkey.

203
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:20,639
Some people like to smoke less, like one cigarette a day or one cigarette a week.

204
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:23,639
But going cold turkey is supposed to be the hardest.

205
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,200
Right.

206
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,639
Okay.

207
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,019
Going cold turkey.

208
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,639
All right.

209
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,399
And well, he was explaining the different negative aspects of smoking.

210
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,759
He said, well, you know, they spend a fortune on cigarettes every month.

211
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,700
And he said laws are cracking down.

212
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,620
So if the laws are cracking down, what is he trying to say there?

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,279
Well, this is actually a very interesting point, because in America right now, it's very hard to smoke in public places.

214
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,500
So this means that the government is trying to stop people from smoking.

215
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:58,399
So they say, no more smoking in public places, no more smoking in restaurants, no more smoking in bars.

216
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,539
And so this is this means they're cracking down.

217
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,840
They're making it harder to do something.

218
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,639
So they are becoming more strict.

219
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:10,299
I think for this phrase, we should listen to a couple of more examples just to make sure we understand it.

220
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,440
Example one.

221
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,539
The police are cracking down on drunk driving in our city.

222
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:20,080
Example two.

223
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,639
Our school has really started to crack down on tardiness.

224
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:26,899
Example three.

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,279
The president has passed a law that will crack down possession of illegal substances.

226
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,220
All right, so the government is cracking down, laws are cracking down.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,480
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,960
So this is an important one, because you read this in the newspapers as well about certain laws and police action.

229
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, great.

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,919
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time.

231
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:54,379
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this vice.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Cut down, which is very different.

233
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,960
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

234
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,080
Look, there are other ways to quit.

235
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,440
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

236
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:30,120
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month.

237
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,139
And now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

238
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,879
It's not like you can just light up like before.

239
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,159
I know I know.

240
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:42,460
I really am trying but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

241
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,120
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch.

242
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,580
Please understand.

243
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:49,480
Fine.

244
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:50,580
I want a divorce.

245
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,220
So do you have a problem with this vice as you call it?

246
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,559
Are you a smoker?

247
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:02,759
I'm really not.

248
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,899
I'm the type of person that could maybe smoke socially.

249
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:11,440
Like if we go out to a bar with drinks, a social smoker like they call it, right?

250
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:11,919
Yeah.

251
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:12,940
I'm jealous.

252
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:13,980
But not really.

253
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,460
You're a habitual smoker, right?

254
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:15,960
Right.

255
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,899
Well, I was.

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,220
I'm trying to cut down.

257
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,200
So as a habitual smoker, I often smoked every day.

258
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,460
Sometimes I smoked a lot and sometimes I smoke less.

259
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,220
But right now I'm in a period where I'm mostly quit.

260
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,100
Okay.

261
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,559
Almost.

262
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,519
Yeah.

263
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,860
Well, I haven't smoked in a while.

264
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
And when I do, it's just one cigarette.

265
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:41,960
Now, it is interesting because like we mentioned, laws are cracking down on where you can smoke, but also taxes and cigarettes are becoming much more expensive, right?

266
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,580
Absolutely.

267
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,139
Especially where I'm from in Chicago.

268
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:49,519
So it's easy to spend maybe 10 US dollars or 12 US dollars on one pack of cigarettes.

269
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,559
On a pack of cigarettes.

270
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,320
Imagine that.

271
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,000
And you have people that can't help smoking one or two packs a day.

272
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,519
So how much is that a month?

273
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,279
It's just an amazing amount of money.

274
00:13:59,299 --> 00:13:59,580
Thousands of dollars.

275
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,340
And I have to say, though, a lot of my friends who used to smoke in America have quit.

276
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,139
So this is maybe working.

277
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,960
The whole thing of making cigarettes more expensive.

278
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,460
Making them much more expensive.

279
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:19,740
Now, another interesting thing and what I was reading recently is that, you know, those warnings that come on cigarette packs that say, you know, smoking kills, smoking causes cancer.

280
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:27,460
Actually, a study has proven that it's not effective, that people don't mind it or even worry about the cautions on the cigarette packages.

281
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,879
Well, as a smoker, I could say that, yeah, you generally, if you're going to smoke a cigarette, don't look at the label that much.

282
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:35,620
You just, you know, you throw it in your bag and you forget about it.

283
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,860
But it's actually gotten to the point where people choose the cigarette pack based on the picture.

284
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,120
So it's like, oh, yeah, give me the one with the black lungs or give me that one.

285
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,019
Oh, God.

286
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,240
Yeah, it's interesting.

287
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:47,000
So it's not really working.

288
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:51,259
I guess we're going to have to find other ways to make people more conscious about this vice.

289
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:51,860
We should.

290
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,940
But come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

Is it bad?

294
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,279
Are you a habitual smoker or just a social smoker?

We'll see you there.

301
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:17,279
Bye.
