1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to another lesson at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Katherine.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today, we're going to be talking about a popular topic all over the world, and that is smoking.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, not so popular in the States right now, to be honest.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, that's the thing.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In every country in the world now, they are becoming more strict on smoking and where you can smoke, so it's becoming very difficult for smokers nowadays.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, it's a good reason to want to quit.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And that's what we're going to be talking about today is quitting smoking.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, before we get going, we do have a really important phrase that we should preview in today's vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All right, so on vocabulary preview, we're going to take a look at this word, pack of smokes.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Pack of smokes.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A pack of smokes.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So, smokes is a word for cigarettes.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's the same thing, smokes or cigarettes.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Right.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But a pack is, you know, like 20 cigarettes.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a box of cigarettes.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You buy them in a pack.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You don't just buy one at a time.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So again, the phrase is pack of smokes.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Pack of smokes.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time and see what's going on with this smoker.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ah, it smells like an ashtray in here.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hi, honey.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What's wrong?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why do you have that look on your face?

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's wrong?

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I thought we agreed you were going to quit smoking.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Look, there are other ways to quit.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not like you can just light up like before.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I know, I know.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please understand.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Fine.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I want a divorce.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sorry, I just smoked a pack of cigarettes.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You do smoke, don't you?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, we'll talk about that later.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
All right.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So it is a little bit extreme, though.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I mean, he's divorcing her because she won't quit.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, some people really are health conscious and are afraid of the negative side of smoking, which has a lot of health side effects.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, as he was complaining about all the negative effects and the negative aspects of smoking, he did mention, both of them mentioned a lot of great words and phrases.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So why don't we take a look at them now in Language Takeaway?

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, this first word is a word that's very important for any smoker who goes to a bar or restaurant and needs to put the ash somewhere, right?

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So when you smoke, there's some ash, there's some messy, dirty stuff, and you need an ash tray to collect it.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
An ash tray.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So an ash tray is something that's usually round or square and you put it on a table and it's just very helpful to keep the house clean or restaurant clean.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So if you're in a restaurant, you say, hey, can I have an ash tray, please?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So the residue or the stuff that when you're smoking, it comes out the gray, I don't know, like dust.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's called ash.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And this is a tray.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But the complaint here is, oh, it smells like an ash tray in here.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That means it smells really, really bad in here.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah, it smells like cigarettes.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So that word again is ashtray.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ashtray.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All right.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, and the guy was complaining and he said, well, I thought you were going to quit smoking.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And she said, no, no, I said I was going to cut down.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She says it's very different from quitting smoking.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So Marco, maybe we should talk about how cutting down and quitting are different.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All right.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So if I say I'm going to cut down on smoking, it's just I'm going to smoke less.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
OK, so let's take an example.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I smoke 10 cigarettes a day, but I want to cut down.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How many should I smoke later?

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Maybe like two or three, two or three instead of quitting.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So if you quit smoking, that would mean zero, zero cigarettes, no smoking anymore.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Right.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All right.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So you can also cut down on carbs like carbohydrates.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So some people who cut down on carbs eat less bread.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They don't eat any pasta.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So these are really good ways of trying to talk about dieting as well as smoking.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And I think we have a couple of examples of other ways we can use this phrase cut down.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So let's listen to them now.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Example one.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Our company has decided to cut down our workload.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So from now on, we leave at 3 p.m.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
every Friday.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Example two.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You should really cut down on the amount of salt you eat.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's not good for you.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Example three.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
My doctor told me I need to cut down on fatty foods because of my heart condition.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And when you want to smoke a cigarette, you have to do something first with some fires.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We call this lighting up.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
To light up.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So lighting up, it doesn't mean turning on the light.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It actually means using a lighter or some fire to start your cigarette.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Right.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So you want to light up with the lighter matches or some sort of fire.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The man says, the husband says, it's not like you can just light up like before.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That means it's not like you can just smoke like before.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So in some cases, light up means to smoke a cigarette.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're in a movie theater and someone lights a cigarette and I say, oh, you can't light up in here.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Right.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So you can't smoke in here.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can't smoke in here.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's another way of saying smoking.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Very good.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And she was explaining, you know, how difficult it is and she's trying to quit, but she said, I don't have the willpower to just quit.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ooh, willpower.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So this is an important word.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Willpower.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Willpower.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You think of the main part of this word is will.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That means the desire to do something.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You want to do something.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So if I have willpower, I have strong willpower, what am I saying?

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're saying that you can make a decision and you can follow your decision.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I decide not to eat cake.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have very strong willpower, so I never eat cake.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If I don't have strong willpower, maybe I sometimes secretly eat cake in the middle of the night from my refrigerator.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So that happens, right?

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sometimes you don't have a strong enough willpower, so you kind of eat a little bit of cake.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Nobody's watching.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And you can have willpower about lots of different things.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So this is a great word, again, to use when you're talking about dieting or smoking or drinking.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Any type of maybe temptation.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Exactly.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
All right.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And well, she said she had this urge to reach for her pack of smokes.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ooh, urge is another good one.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's very similar to willpower, but an urge is kind of like a physical feeling that makes you want to do something.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So you have like this strong desire.

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So I have the urge to go swimming today.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know why, but I really want to.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
All right.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You have an urge.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Interesting word.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Pregnant women often have these kinds of things, too.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have the urge to do something.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We also call them cravings.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, cravings or urge to do something.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Interesting.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So we've taken a look at these five great words, and I think we should listen to our dialogue again.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We're going to slow it down just a little bit, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, it smells like an ashtray in here.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hi, honey.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What's wrong?

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why do you have that look on your face?

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What's wrong?

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I thought we agreed that you were going to quit smoking.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, I said I was going to cut down, which is very different.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Look, there are other ways to quit.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month, and now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's not like you can just light up like before.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I know.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I know.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I really am trying, but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Please understand.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Fine.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I want a divorce.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And we are back.

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So we have a great part of our show where we like to talk about some phrases that help you attain fluency.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That means sounding like a native speaker of English, and today's phrases are wonderful.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All right, so let's take a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So on Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at two different phrases, and let's start with the first one.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
She mentioned something about going cold turkey overnight.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is that phrase?

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Cold turkey.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now, this is a very strange phrase, okay?

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So first of all, why would a turkey be cold?

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They have lots of feathers.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And second of all, what does it have to do with cigarettes?

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So if I say I'm going cold turkey, what is that?

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So just take this as a phrase.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't think about the actual words because they won't make sense in this context.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What we're talking about is quitting smoking entirely.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're not going to cut down.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That means today I'm not going to smoke at all, and I'm never going to smoke again.

193
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That means never ever will I smoke another cigarette.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So it's cold turkey.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So if I go cold turkey means I stop doing something immediately and suddenly and forever.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Entirely.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Alright.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you can use this phrase for different habits, different things that you do, like drinking for example, or cutting down on sugar.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But generally we just say this about cigarettes.

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So it's mostly related to smoking.

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Going cold turkey.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Some people like to smoke less, like one cigarette a day or one cigarette a week.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But going cold turkey is supposed to be the hardest.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Right.

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Going cold turkey.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
All right.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And well, he was explaining the different negative aspects of smoking.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He said, well, you know, they spend a fortune on cigarettes every month.

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And he said laws are cracking down.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So if the laws are cracking down, what is he trying to say there?

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, this is actually a very interesting point, because in America right now, it's very hard to smoke in public places.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So this means that the government is trying to stop people from smoking.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So they say, no more smoking in public places, no more smoking in restaurants, no more smoking in bars.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And so this is this means they're cracking down.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They're making it harder to do something.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So they are becoming more strict.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think for this phrase, we should listen to a couple of more examples just to make sure we understand it.

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Example one.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The police are cracking down on drunk driving in our city.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Example two.

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Our school has really started to crack down on tardiness.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Example three.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The president has passed a law that will crack down possession of illegal substances.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right, so the government is cracking down, laws are cracking down.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So this is an important one, because you read this in the newspapers as well about certain laws and police action.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, great.

230
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for one last time.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this vice.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Cut down, which is very different.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can't just expect me to go cold turkey overnight.

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Look, there are other ways to quit.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can try the nicotine patch or nicotine chewing gum.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We spend a fortune on cigarettes every month.

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And now laws are cracking down and not allowing smoking in any public place.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's not like you can just light up like before.

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I know I know.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I really am trying but I don't have the willpower to just quit.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't fight with the urge to reach for my pack of smokes in the morning with coffee or after lunch.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Please understand.

243
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Fine.

244
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want a divorce.

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So do you have a problem with this vice as you call it?

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Are you a smoker?

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm really not.

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm the type of person that could maybe smoke socially.

249
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Like if we go out to a bar with drinks, a social smoker like they call it, right?

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm jealous.

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But not really.

253
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're a habitual smoker, right?

254
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Right.

255
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, I was.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm trying to cut down.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So as a habitual smoker, I often smoked every day.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Sometimes I smoked a lot and sometimes I smoke less.

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But right now I'm in a period where I'm mostly quit.

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

261
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Almost.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah.

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, I haven't smoked in a while.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And when I do, it's just one cigarette.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Now, it is interesting because like we mentioned, laws are cracking down on where you can smoke, but also taxes and cigarettes are becoming much more expensive, right?

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Absolutely.

267
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Especially where I'm from in Chicago.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So it's easy to spend maybe 10 US dollars or 12 US dollars on one pack of cigarettes.

269
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
On a pack of cigarettes.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Imagine that.

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And you have people that can't help smoking one or two packs a day.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So how much is that a month?

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's just an amazing amount of money.

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thousands of dollars.

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And I have to say, though, a lot of my friends who used to smoke in America have quit.

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So this is maybe working.

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The whole thing of making cigarettes more expensive.

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Making them much more expensive.

279
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Now, another interesting thing and what I was reading recently is that, you know, those warnings that come on cigarette packs that say, you know, smoking kills, smoking causes cancer.

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Actually, a study has proven that it's not effective, that people don't mind it or even worry about the cautions on the cigarette packages.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, as a smoker, I could say that, yeah, you generally, if you're going to smoke a cigarette, don't look at the label that much.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You just, you know, you throw it in your bag and you forget about it.

283
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But it's actually gotten to the point where people choose the cigarette pack based on the picture.

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's like, oh, yeah, give me the one with the black lungs or give me that one.

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, God.

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, it's interesting.

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So it's not really working.

288
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I guess we're going to have to find other ways to make people more conscious about this vice.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We should.

290
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

Is it bad?

294
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000

We'll see you there.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Bye.
