EnglishPod.com Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,780
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

3
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,539
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

4
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,140
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

5
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,719
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in 4 sets.

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,700
5 kilo weight should be enough.

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,560
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,560
You might pull a muscle.

9
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:51,859
Got it.

10
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,259
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,899
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,899
It's not that much.

13
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,780
Just watch.

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,180
I'm okay.
