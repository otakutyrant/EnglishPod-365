EnglishPod.com Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in 4 sets.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
5 kilo weight should be enough.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You might pull a muscle.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Got it.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's not that much.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Just watch.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm okay.
