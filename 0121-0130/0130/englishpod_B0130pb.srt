00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,120
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,599
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,780
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,720
And today, I think we're hitting the gym, Marco.

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,000
We need to be healthy.

7
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,060
We've gained weight over the winter, I think.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,839
I think so.

9
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:21,480
And being in an office, you know, it doesn't give you much opportunity to go and exercise and really get a lot of work.

10
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:22,260
Exactly.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,899
So that's why we're going to the gym on this occasion.

12
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,219
We're going to be pumping some iron.

13
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:28,640
We're going to be working out.

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,280
So, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview and see what this means.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,420
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:36,719
Alright, so, to pump iron.

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,340
What does that mean?

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,020
Alright, well, to pumping iron means lifting weights.

19
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,079
Okay, so we're pumping iron.

20
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,619
We're lifting weights.

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,920
Because, you know, weights are made of iron.

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,280
Right.

23
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,060
That's what makes them so heavy.

24
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:49,799
Alright, so we're pumping iron.

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,039
Good.

26
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,159
And, well, we're going to be giving you guys some pointers.

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,200
Pointers.

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:54,600
Right.

29
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,740
Alright, so you might have heard the word point before.

30
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,020
Well, pointers is another word for tips.

31
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,359
Alright, so we're going to be giving you tips or advice.

32
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,219
Yep, so you're going to get some help today from the trainer.

33
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,000
Alright, so we're going to jump right into this dialogue and we come back, we'll be talking more about what's going on.

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,680
Hey there.

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,079
You look a little lost.

36
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,260
Are you new here?

37
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:20,379
Yeah.

38
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,219
How did you know?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,400
You can always spot the newbies.

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,599
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

41
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,459
Were you trying to use this machine here?

42
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,579
Yeah, I just started my training today and I'm not sure where to begin.

43
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,019
It's okay.

44
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I know how it is.

45
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,959
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,700
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,480
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,239
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

49
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:50,859
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

50
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,459
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

51
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,420
Five kilo weight should be enough.

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,260
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron.

53
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,280
You might pull a muscle.

54
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:01,540
Got it.

55
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,959
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

56
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,579
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

57
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,599
It's not that much.

58
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,479
Just watch.

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,879
I'm okay.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,740
So this guy was a little bit arrogant.

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,439
I think he was very, you know, very muscular, but I think he embarrassed himself in front of the lady.

62
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,500
The trainer, you mean?

63
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:29,900
Yeah.

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,599
Yeah, definitely.

65
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:33,039
So we say he had a big ego.

66
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,020
He thought a lot about himself.

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:44,259
So let's check out some of these phrases and words they were using because they're all related to going to the gym and they can help you if you ever want to get some help when you're at the gym.

68
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,460
So this girl, she was new in the gym.

69
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,979
She didn't really know what she was doing.

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,860
And well, the guy said, well, do you want to develop strength or muscle tone?

71
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,960
All right, we know what strength is, but what is muscle tone?

72
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:11,500
Okay, so if you want to develop muscle tone or to have muscle tone, it means that you have healthy muscles, not like huge, big muscles, right?

73
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,580
But you have a nice body.

74
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:18,520
So tone to tone is to maybe make, give some shape to something.

75
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,800
You know, sometimes you have big arms and they're not really, you can't see the muscles.

76
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,120
Well, muscle tone means that you can start to see the shape and they start to get stronger.

77
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,719
All right.

78
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,560
So if you think of Madonna, maybe five years ago, she had a lot of muscle tone.

79
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:34,599
Now she's like big muscles.

80
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,439
She's strong.

81
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,199
But muscle tone means that you can see the muscles.

82
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,360
They start to develop.

83
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,039
Okay.

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,740
And this actually is very related to our next word because you said muscle tone and definition.

85
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:45,560
Right.

86
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,360
So definition is another way for us to describe seeing those muscles because at first you have a big tummy or you have big arms.

87
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,439
And when you start to work out, every time you go, you can see more and more definition.

88
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,960
That means more and more of the muscle becomes visible.

89
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,699
All right.

90
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,620
So you have defined muscles.

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,400
All right, good.

92
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Now the girl was like, no, no, I don't want to be like super strong and huge, right?

93
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,780
She doesn't want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

94
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,719
Yeah, exactly.

95
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,699
She said, I just want a good physique.

96
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:12,520
All right.

97
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,420
This word maybe sounds strange for some of you because it's more like French than English.

98
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:17,579
Yeah.

99
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,819
Well, it does come from French.

100
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,759
And physique is a way to talk about the whole body.

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,959
You know, the physique is the state of your whole body.

102
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,199
It's your physical appearance.

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:27,660
Okay.

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,680
So I can say she has a nice physique.

105
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,500
So that means she probably works out a lot.

106
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:37,699
But basically it's like her whole body, right?

107
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:42,259
You can't just say like, she has good physique in her arms or something like that.

108
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,879
No, no, your physique, physical, think of the word physical.

109
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,199
It's your whole body.

110
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,920
Your whole body.

111
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,420
All right.

112
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,699
So good physique.

113
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,180
And now the tips that he was giving her or the pointers, he was talking about these two words, reps and sets.

114
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:56,879
Right.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,060
These are great words for the gym because they allow us to count when we're working out.

116
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,439
So the first one is reps or repetitions.

117
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,220
That means doing something over and over again.

118
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,959
So for example, if I want to lift a weight, I sit down on the bench, I do one, two, three.

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,839
How many times I lift that weight is a repetition or a rep.

120
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:20,540
All right.

121
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,920
And well, and what about sets?

122
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,839
So I could say I lift the weight 10 times, one, two, three, four, all the way to 10.

123
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,399
And then I wait and then I do it again.

124
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,959
So the number of times I do it again is a set.

125
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,680
So sets of 10 or sets of five.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,079
Okay.

127
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:49,420
So if you are lifting this weight 10 times and you have five sets, you will do a total of 50 pushes or lifts or repetitions.

128
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:57,180
So reps and sets are probably the most important or common words you'll hear in the gym, especially if you're lifting weights, right?

129
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:57,980
Definitely.

130
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,259
And sometimes your trainer will count with you so that he'll keep a count while you're working out.

131
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:03,980
All right.

132
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,560
Cool.

133
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,980
So those are the words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

134
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:15,379
I think in order to better understand these words, we should listen to our dialogue again, but we're going to slow it down just a little bit.

135
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,379
Hey there, you look a little lost.

136
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,779
Are you new here?

137
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:24,639
Yeah.

138
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,560
How did you know?

139
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,480
You can always spot the newbies.

140
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:31,399
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

141
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,959
Were you trying to use this machine here?

142
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,100
Yeah.

143
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,220
I just started my training today.

144
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,079
I'm not really sure where to begin.

145
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,180
It's okay.

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
I know how it is.

147
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,240
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

148
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,540
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

149
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,800
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

150
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,300
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

151
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,459
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

152
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,660
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

153
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,819
Five kilo weights should be enough.

154
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,240
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.

155
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,480
Got it.

156
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,360
Wow.

157
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,800
Is that the weight you're lifting?

158
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,060
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

159
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,879
It's not that much.

160
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,100
Just watch.

161
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,300
I'm okay.

162
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:41,939
All right, so you might have heard some other phrases in there that sound interesting or new to you and that's why we're going to go into the fluency builder part of the lesson where we can talk about sounding more fluent in English.

163
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,439
Fluency builder.

164
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,399
All right, so the girl, she was a little bit lost, right?

165
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,120
So this guy was trying to help her out.

166
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,800
I think it was her first time in the gym.

167
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,740
It was and she doesn't really know where to start, which is a common problem for people who go to the gym for the first time.

168
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,319
So the guy said, well, yeah, I know how it is.

169
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,420
How what is.

170
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,319
Exactly.

171
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,079
How what is.

172
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,899
It's a very strange phrase because it's vague.

173
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,800
It's not clear.

174
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,139
So what is he referring to?

175
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,360
There's something very common that we say in English to mean I understand your situation.

176
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,279
I know how you feel.

177
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,339
I know how you feel.

178
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,740
So she says, this is my first time.

179
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,220
I don't know what to do.

180
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,920
And he says, I know how it is.

181
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,279
I understand your situation.

182
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,339
Right, because I imagine the first time he went to the gym, he felt the same way.

183
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:30,980
Exactly.

184
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,919
I could say, I'm so lost.

185
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,820
I'm new at this school.

186
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,039
I don't even know anyone.

187
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah, I know how it is.

188
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,740
I was new here last year.

189
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,559
So trust me, I know how it is.

190
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:46,500
OK, so Marco and I have similar situations, although he has already experienced it so he can help me out.

191
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,639
This is a good phrase.

192
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,279
It's actually I think it's very common for somebody to kind of sympathize with you.

193
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,379
Absolutely.

194
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,039
And it's a really good phrase if you want to help someone who looks lost or confused.

195
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:04,600
So if someone joins your work, if you have a new colleague and they say, oh, I don't know where anything is.

196
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,039
I don't know how to do anything at my job.

197
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,500
You say, oh, I know how it is.

198
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,039
I was new here last month.

199
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,200
Great.

200
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,759
And well, now they were talking about, you know, lifting weights and the physique.

201
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,120
And she said this interesting where she says, I don't want to be ripped like you.

202
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,679
OK, so many of you have probably heard the other meaning of the word to rip or ripped.

203
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,100
So this is to rip, to tear.

204
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,019
But in this case, it's an adjective.

205
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,080
It's a way to describe someone's physique, their body.

206
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,259
And we're talking about people who are very, very muscular.

207
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,200
OK, so basically bodybuilders.

208
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,399
Arnold Schwarzenegger is ripped.

209
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,340
He has ripped huge muscles.

210
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,220
Madonna is ripped.

211
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,659
She has huge muscles.

212
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:53,080
So it's a very informal way, but it's a very informal way of saying very muscular.

213
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,679
Yeah, it's someone who works out a lot.

214
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:56,820
All right.

215
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,460
You're ripped.

216
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,279
And after this, we've got one more phrase.

217
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:05,360
It's actually very important because when we talk about going to the gym, working out, we have to talk about safety and your health as well.

218
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,860
It's very easy to hurt yourself.

219
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,379
Right.

220
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,759
And that's what we want to avoid.

221
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,139
You don't want to pull a muscle.

222
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:12,860
All right.

223
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:13,820
Pull a muscle.

224
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,919
This is a key phrase here because we have a special combination of verb and noun.

225
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,879
The thing that we pull is our muscle.

226
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,460
And what we do to it is we pull it.

227
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,139
That means we hurt it.

228
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,980
So if you don't stretch and you're lifting weights, maybe your muscle will start to hurt and you can't lift anymore.

229
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah, you hurt it.

230
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,159
You pulled your muscle.

231
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,740
Pulled a muscle.

232
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:35,500
Or often runners have this problem.

233
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,460
They don't stretch before they run or they run too much and they have a lot of pain in their muscles.

234
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:41,860
You say, I pulled a muscle.

235
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,980
Now I think there's another way of saying it also is to tear a muscle, right?

236
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,059
Tear is more serious.

237
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:48,620
More serious.

238
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:53,279
A tear is like a little rip in your muscle and you should really see a doctor about that.

239
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,139
So we don't want you to pull a muscle or to tear a muscle so be sure to stretch.

240
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,399
But we have some more examples with this phrase, to pull a muscle, so let's listen.

241
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
Example one.

242
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,399
Muscle strains, also called pull muscles, are common sports injuries.

243
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,019
Example two.

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,899
If you do not warm up before a physical activity, you can easily pull a muscle.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,039
Example three.

246
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,100
Anyone can pull a muscle because of overuse, muscle fatigue, or through a fall.

247
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:37,500
Alright, so now that that's clear, I think we can listen to our gym dialogue one more time and see what happens to this arrogant bodybuilder.

248
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,240
Absolutely.

249
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,159
Hey there, you look a little lost.

250
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,419
Are you new here?

251
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
Yeah, how did you know?

252
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,480
You can always spot the newbies.

253
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,679
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

254
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,580
Were you trying to use this machine here?

255
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,659
Yeah, I just started my training today and I'm not sure where to begin.

256
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,600
It's okay, I know how it is.

257
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,059
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

258
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,779
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

259
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,320
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you, I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

260
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:19,940
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

261
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,519
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in 4 sets.

262
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,500
5 kilo weight should be enough.

263
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.

264
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,679
Got it.

265
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:33,039
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

266
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,700
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

267
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,659
It's not that much, just watch.

268
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,019
I'm okay.

269
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,460
Alright Catherine, so we know that you are a very healthy person.

270
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,179
You often go to the gym.

271
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,080
This is true, I like to go to the gym.

272
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,919
So any gym stories?

273
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,879
Oh gosh, I have lots of gym stories.

274
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,059
I like to run and I often use the treadmill.

275
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,360
And I've never really understood the people who don't run on the treadmill.

276
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,320
People who stand or who walk.

277
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,519
Oh, who walk on the treadmill.

278
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,120
And I remember, my gym is usually very crowded.

279
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,419
I remember one time I was at my gym and I wanted to run on the treadmill.

280
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,840
I had a long day at work and I had to go out afterwards.

281
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,720
So I didn't have much time, I only had an hour.

282
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,000
And I really wanted to run, but there's a line for the treadmills.

283
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,000
There are too many people.

284
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,740
And this particular day I was waiting and waiting and waiting.

285
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,320
And finally it was my turn and I stepped and a woman cut in front of me.

286
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:36,960
No.

287
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,159
She cut in front of me and I was so angry.

288
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,080
And what did she do?

289
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,820
In her heels.

290
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:42,779
Heels?

291
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,759
Heels, big shoes.

292
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,740
She walked for 40 minutes.

293
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:48,039
Oh my god.

294
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,480
You could go outside and walk, I want to run.

295
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,580
But she was wearing heels at the gym.

296
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,080
In her heels at the gym.

297
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,679
Wow.

298
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,759
Well I guess you have to look nice when you go to the gym also.

299
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,860
Apparently, apparently.

300
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Well it is a very popular place for people to meet, right?

301
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:02,700
It is.

302
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:03,139
To start dating.

303
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:09,899
They say after the office, the gym is one of the most common places for people to meet their boyfriends and girlfriends.

304
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,279
Wow.

305
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,799
So there's another good reason why you should go to the gym.

306
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,039
Absolutely, yeah.

307
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,419
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

308
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,120
But we would like to hear if you have any questions, any doubts, or comments.

309
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,240
So come to our site, EnglishPod.com.

310
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,340
And if you have any gym stories, we'd also like to hear those.

311
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,899
So that's going to do it for us.

312
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,720
Until next time everyone, bye.

313
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,220
Alright, bye.
