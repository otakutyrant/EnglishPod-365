00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And my name is Catherine.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today, I think we're hitting the gym, Marco.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We need to be healthy.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've gained weight over the winter, I think.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think so.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And being in an office, you know, it doesn't give you much opportunity to go and exercise and really get a lot of work.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So that's why we're going to the gym on this occasion.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're going to be pumping some iron.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're going to be working out.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview and see what this means.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, so, to pump iron.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What does that mean?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Alright, well, to pumping iron means lifting weights.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, so we're pumping iron.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're lifting weights.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Because, you know, weights are made of iron.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Right.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's what makes them so heavy.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Alright, so we're pumping iron.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And, well, we're going to be giving you guys some pointers.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Pointers.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Right.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Alright, so you might have heard the word point before.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, pointers is another word for tips.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Alright, so we're going to be giving you tips or advice.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yep, so you're going to get some help today from the trainer.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Alright, so we're going to jump right into this dialogue and we come back, we'll be talking more about what's going on.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey there.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You look a little lost.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you new here?

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How did you know?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can always spot the newbies.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Were you trying to use this machine here?

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, I just started my training today and I'm not sure where to begin.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's okay.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I know how it is.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Five kilo weight should be enough.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron.

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You might pull a muscle.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Got it.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's not that much.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Just watch.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm okay.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So this guy was a little bit arrogant.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think he was very, you know, very muscular, but I think he embarrassed himself in front of the lady.

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The trainer, you mean?

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, definitely.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So we say he had a big ego.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He thought a lot about himself.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So let's check out some of these phrases and words they were using because they're all related to going to the gym and they can help you if you ever want to get some help when you're at the gym.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So this girl, she was new in the gym.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She didn't really know what she was doing.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And well, the guy said, well, do you want to develop strength or muscle tone?

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All right, we know what strength is, but what is muscle tone?

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, so if you want to develop muscle tone or to have muscle tone, it means that you have healthy muscles, not like huge, big muscles, right?

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But you have a nice body.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So tone to tone is to maybe make, give some shape to something.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You know, sometimes you have big arms and they're not really, you can't see the muscles.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well, muscle tone means that you can start to see the shape and they start to get stronger.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So if you think of Madonna, maybe five years ago, she had a lot of muscle tone.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now she's like big muscles.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She's strong.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But muscle tone means that you can see the muscles.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They start to develop.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And this actually is very related to our next word because you said muscle tone and definition.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Right.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So definition is another way for us to describe seeing those muscles because at first you have a big tummy or you have big arms.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And when you start to work out, every time you go, you can see more and more definition.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That means more and more of the muscle becomes visible.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All right.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So you have defined muscles.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, good.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now the girl was like, no, no, I don't want to be like super strong and huge, right?

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
She doesn't want to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah, exactly.

95
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She said, I just want a good physique.

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This word maybe sounds strange for some of you because it's more like French than English.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, it does come from French.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And physique is a way to talk about the whole body.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You know, the physique is the state of your whole body.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's your physical appearance.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So I can say she has a nice physique.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So that means she probably works out a lot.

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But basically it's like her whole body, right?

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't just say like, she has good physique in her arms or something like that.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, no, your physique, physical, think of the word physical.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's your whole body.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Your whole body.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All right.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So good physique.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And now the tips that he was giving her or the pointers, he was talking about these two words, reps and sets.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Right.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
These are great words for the gym because they allow us to count when we're working out.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So the first one is reps or repetitions.

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That means doing something over and over again.

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So for example, if I want to lift a weight, I sit down on the bench, I do one, two, three.

119
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How many times I lift that weight is a repetition or a rep.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All right.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And well, and what about sets?

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So I could say I lift the weight 10 times, one, two, three, four, all the way to 10.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then I wait and then I do it again.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So the number of times I do it again is a set.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So sets of 10 or sets of five.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So if you are lifting this weight 10 times and you have five sets, you will do a total of 50 pushes or lifts or repetitions.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So reps and sets are probably the most important or common words you'll hear in the gym, especially if you're lifting weights, right?

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Definitely.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And sometimes your trainer will count with you so that he'll keep a count while you're working out.

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All right.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Cool.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So those are the words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think in order to better understand these words, we should listen to our dialogue again, but we're going to slow it down just a little bit.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hey there, you look a little lost.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you new here?

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How did you know?

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can always spot the newbies.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Were you trying to use this machine here?

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I just started my training today.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not really sure where to begin.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's okay.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I know how it is.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in four sets.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Five kilo weights should be enough.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Got it.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wow.

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Is that the weight you're lifting?

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's not that much.

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Just watch.

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm okay.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right, so you might have heard some other phrases in there that sound interesting or new to you and that's why we're going to go into the fluency builder part of the lesson where we can talk about sounding more fluent in English.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Fluency builder.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All right, so the girl, she was a little bit lost, right?

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So this guy was trying to help her out.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think it was her first time in the gym.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was and she doesn't really know where to start, which is a common problem for people who go to the gym for the first time.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So the guy said, well, yeah, I know how it is.

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How what is.

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Exactly.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How what is.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a very strange phrase because it's vague.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not clear.

174
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So what is he referring to?

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There's something very common that we say in English to mean I understand your situation.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I know how you feel.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I know how you feel.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So she says, this is my first time.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know what to do.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And he says, I know how it is.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I understand your situation.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Right, because I imagine the first time he went to the gym, he felt the same way.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Exactly.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I could say, I'm so lost.

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm new at this school.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't even know anyone.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, I know how it is.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was new here last year.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So trust me, I know how it is.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
OK, so Marco and I have similar situations, although he has already experienced it so he can help me out.

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is a good phrase.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's actually I think it's very common for somebody to kind of sympathize with you.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Absolutely.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And it's a really good phrase if you want to help someone who looks lost or confused.

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So if someone joins your work, if you have a new colleague and they say, oh, I don't know where anything is.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know how to do anything at my job.

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You say, oh, I know how it is.

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I was new here last month.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Great.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And well, now they were talking about, you know, lifting weights and the physique.

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And she said this interesting where she says, I don't want to be ripped like you.

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OK, so many of you have probably heard the other meaning of the word to rip or ripped.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So this is to rip, to tear.

204
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But in this case, it's an adjective.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a way to describe someone's physique, their body.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And we're talking about people who are very, very muscular.

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
OK, so basically bodybuilders.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger is ripped.

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He has ripped huge muscles.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Madonna is ripped.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She has huge muscles.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So it's a very informal way, but it's a very informal way of saying very muscular.

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, it's someone who works out a lot.

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
All right.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You're ripped.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And after this, we've got one more phrase.

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's actually very important because when we talk about going to the gym, working out, we have to talk about safety and your health as well.

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's very easy to hurt yourself.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Right.

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And that's what we want to avoid.

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You don't want to pull a muscle.

222
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right.

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Pull a muscle.

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is a key phrase here because we have a special combination of verb and noun.

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The thing that we pull is our muscle.

226
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And what we do to it is we pull it.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That means we hurt it.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So if you don't stretch and you're lifting weights, maybe your muscle will start to hurt and you can't lift anymore.

229
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, you hurt it.

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You pulled your muscle.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Pulled a muscle.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or often runners have this problem.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They don't stretch before they run or they run too much and they have a lot of pain in their muscles.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You say, I pulled a muscle.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now I think there's another way of saying it also is to tear a muscle, right?

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Tear is more serious.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
More serious.

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A tear is like a little rip in your muscle and you should really see a doctor about that.

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So we don't want you to pull a muscle or to tear a muscle so be sure to stretch.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But we have some more examples with this phrase, to pull a muscle, so let's listen.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Example one.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Muscle strains, also called pull muscles, are common sports injuries.

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Example two.

244
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you do not warm up before a physical activity, you can easily pull a muscle.

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Example three.

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Anyone can pull a muscle because of overuse, muscle fatigue, or through a fall.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Alright, so now that that's clear, I think we can listen to our gym dialogue one more time and see what happens to this arrogant bodybuilder.

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Absolutely.

249
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hey there, you look a little lost.

250
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Are you new here?

251
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, how did you know?

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You can always spot the newbies.

253
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can give you a few pointers if you want.

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Were you trying to use this machine here?

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, I just started my training today and I'm not sure where to begin.

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's okay, I know how it is.

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This machine here will work out your upper body, mainly your triceps and biceps.

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition?

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, I don't want to be ripped like you, I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
In that case, you want to work with less weight.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You can start off by working 10 to 15 reps in 4 sets.

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
5 kilo weight should be enough.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now it's very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle.

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Got it.

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Wow, is that the weight you're lifting?

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
My goodness, that's a lot of weight.

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not that much, just watch.

268
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm okay.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Alright Catherine, so we know that you are a very healthy person.

270
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You often go to the gym.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is true, I like to go to the gym.

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So any gym stories?

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh gosh, I have lots of gym stories.

274
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I like to run and I often use the treadmill.

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And I've never really understood the people who don't run on the treadmill.

276
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
People who stand or who walk.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, who walk on the treadmill.

278
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I remember, my gym is usually very crowded.

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I remember one time I was at my gym and I wanted to run on the treadmill.

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I had a long day at work and I had to go out afterwards.

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So I didn't have much time, I only had an hour.

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And I really wanted to run, but there's a line for the treadmills.

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There are too many people.

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And this particular day I was waiting and waiting and waiting.

285
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And finally it was my turn and I stepped and a woman cut in front of me.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No.

287
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
She cut in front of me and I was so angry.

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And what did she do?

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
In her heels.

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Heels?

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Heels, big shoes.

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
She walked for 40 minutes.

293
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Oh my god.

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You could go outside and walk, I want to run.

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But she was wearing heels at the gym.

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In her heels at the gym.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wow.

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well I guess you have to look nice when you go to the gym also.

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Apparently, apparently.

300
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well it is a very popular place for people to meet, right?

301
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It is.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
To start dating.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They say after the office, the gym is one of the most common places for people to meet their boyfriends and girlfriends.

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Wow.

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So there's another good reason why you should go to the gym.

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Absolutely, yeah.

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But we would like to hear if you have any questions, any doubts, or comments.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So come to our site, EnglishPod.com.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And if you have any gym stories, we'd also like to hear those.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So that's going to do it for us.

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Until next time everyone, bye.

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Alright, bye.
