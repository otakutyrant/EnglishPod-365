00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:09,660
EnglishPod.com Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,599
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly, is that right?

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:14,660
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:17,460
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

5
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:23,519
I was really just treated more like an intern, I didn't have many responsibilities, and I found it quite frustrating.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,320
So, what changed?

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,280
Well, slowly but surely, I proved myself, and the new editor liked me, so he promoted me to features writer.

8
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,200
Wow, a real step up.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,600
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,560
I spent three years in that position.

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,020
But, to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,359
I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?

13
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,000
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,140
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
.
