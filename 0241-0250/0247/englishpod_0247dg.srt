00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly, is that right?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was really just treated more like an intern, I didn't have many responsibilities, and I found it quite frustrating.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, what changed?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, slowly but surely, I proved myself, and the new editor liked me, so he promoted me to features writer.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Wow, a real step up.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I spent three years in that position.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But, to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
.
