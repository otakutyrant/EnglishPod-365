00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today, we're going to continue in our series about job interviews.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And on this occasion, we're taking a look at part five of our interview series where we explain why we left our previous job.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And so in an interview, this is a very popular question.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why did you leave your last job?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Learn some tools for answering this question in today's dialogue.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're going to take a listen to it first, and we'll be back in a moment.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is that right?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was really just treated more like an intern.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I didn't have many responsibilities, and I found it quite frustrating.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So what changed?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, slowly but surely, I proved myself, and the new editor liked me, so he promoted me to features writer.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wow, a real step up.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I spent three years in that position.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I see.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So why did you decide to leave finally?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Alright, we're back, and as we saw, Rebecca handled it quite well, explaining why you left your last job.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because obviously, you don't want to say something like, well, I just really didn't like my company, or, you know, the boss was a really bad guy.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Or I was fired for being lazy.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Exactly.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So why don't we take a look at a couple of different words on language takeaway.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, so we've got some great descriptive words here.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
These are some adjectives.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The first one is tough.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So Rebecca said, to be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright, so she's describing that her first year at that company where she was working, it was tough.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And that means hard, difficult.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So you could say, this is a really tough situation.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That means it's a difficult situation.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's hard because there's no easy answer.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So if you describe something as tough, it means that it's very difficult.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now, there is another meaning to this where it can be that you are a strong person.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that's different because we're talking about a person, not a situation.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But if you're talking about a job or an experience, or even homework, like this homework is really tough, it means that it's very hard.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, apart from her job of being a little bit tough, she said that it was also a little bit frustrating.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, so usually these things go together.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If something is tough, like it's difficult, it's usually frustrating too.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so in this case, something is frustrating when it makes you unhappy or, for example, it makes you feel stressed.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So something that's frustrating is not a good thing.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Exactly.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So as you gave the example with the homework assignment, if you have maybe a math assignment that's very difficult and you can't solve it, you don't find the solution, then you get frustrated.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You get maybe angry at yourself or you get very angry for not being able to solve it.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So that's when something is frustrating.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I hate being frustrated.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Exactly.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, it's not a nice feeling, but she said that, well, it was frustrating, it was tough, but, you know, after a while I proved myself.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, so that means that she was able to show someone that she can handle difficult things, difficult work, difficult situations.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so she said, I proved myself and the new editor liked me.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So basically she did a really good job.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Exactly.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So if you prove yourself, you're showing someone that you have great ability or capabilities of solving a problem or being able to handle a difficult job.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
For example, I could say, you know, last year Bob didn't do very well at school, but this year he really proved himself.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He studied hard and he got really good grades.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And, well, Rebecca, what she got in exchange for proving herself, she got promoted.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is great.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So promotions are good things.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The verb here is to promote or to be promoted.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So in this case, she was promoted.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You could say last year I was promoted or he will be promoted next week.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He doesn't know yet.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Exactly.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now remember that to be promoted means to get a better position in your job.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now, as we mentioned, the verb is to promote and you may be asking yourself why we are using the verb to be in the past was promoted.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And this is because it's an ed adjective.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's an adjective that ends in ed.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So you may think it's a verb, but it's not.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's actually an adjective.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The verb here is to be.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Exactly.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I was promoted.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was is obviously our verb here, the verb to be, but promoted is an adjective that ends in ed.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And so if I'm the boss, the action I do, the verb I do is I promote someone.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So this can be a little bit tricky, but we recommend that you check out the website for more details because we have lots of examples of how to use this.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Exactly.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, she got promoted and, well, she was really happy for a while, but then she said, you know what?

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I really needed a more challenging role, a more challenging job.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Challenging is a great adjective.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It means something is difficult or it gives you a challenge.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So that means it's not easy.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So she found that her job was a little bit too easy, so she wanted something a little bit more challenging.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And so this is a really great word for job interviews in particular because you're basically saying I want hard work.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to prove myself.

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
There we go again.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I want to show you that I'm a good employee or a hard worker, and so I want a challenge, something that's hard.

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Exactly.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So something that is hard is a challenge or you want something challenging.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So why don't we review these words that we've taken a look at now.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go back to the dialogue and listen to it again.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is that right?

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, that's right.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was really just treated more like an intern.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I didn't have many responsibilities, and I found it quite frustrating.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So what changed?

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, slowly but surely, I proved myself, and the new editor liked me, so he promoted me to features writer.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wow.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A real step up.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I spent three years in that position.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I see.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So why did you decide to leave finally?

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All right, we're back.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Fluency Builder.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay, this first phrase is unusual because it actually happens at the end of sentences.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is very, very common with people who are making small talk or who are doing interviews.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is the phrase, is that right?

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So basically, you saw that in the first line, Mr.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Parsons was talking to her and said, Well, I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is that right?

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So he's ending the sentence with this phrase.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So he's making the sentence a question.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I see that you did this.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is that right?

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So he's asking her to confirm the fact that he knows about her because maybe they've never really talked before.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So this is a good way for him to ask her to give more details.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Exactly.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So, for example, Marco, I hear that you're from Ecuador.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is that right?

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So apart from ending the sentence like this, if maybe somebody asks you, is that right?

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have to confirm.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You have to say, Yes, that's right.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Or, Yes.

148
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's also good to elaborate, to give more details.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, Yes, I'm from Ecuador.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I was born there, but I've lived in the United States.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is a way to give more information because that's basically what the person's asking.

152
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I think it wouldn't be very good if you're at a job interview and the person says, Is that right?

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And you say, Yes, that's right.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And then you don't say anything else.

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, yeah, basically the point is you have to confirm or deny.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You have to say, Yes, that's right.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Or, No, that's not right.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And then you have to give some information about the question.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All right.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now, moving on.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When Rebecca, again, was talking about her job, she was saying, It's tough and I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So this is like lost and found.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Like I lost my hat and I found it later.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, no.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is what's interesting about this verb find.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We are not actually looking for something or we didn't actually find something we were looking for.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is kind of a realization, right?

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's like a feeling.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So I find this movie boring.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That means I think this movie is boring.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's the way that you're thinking about something.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or you can say, Oh, I found Paris to be quite an expensive city.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, pretty expensive.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So this is your impression.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is the way that you feel about something.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So this is another way that you can use this word to find.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now, again, when Rebecca talked about proving herself, she used a very interesting, I would say phrase, a very popular, well-known phrase, Slowly but surely.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So slowly but surely is the opposite of right away.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So something that happens right away is immediate.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like I got promoted right away.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But slowly but surely means after lots of time and even hard work, this good thing happened or it's usually a good thing actually.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

188
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's you're basically saying that you didn't do anything very quickly, but you did it very well.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So slowly but surely I finished building my home.

190
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Right.

191
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So it didn't happen overnight, but it did happen over time.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can also say this about studying a language.

193
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know, at the beginning, learning English was really hard, but slowly but surely I became fluent.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Exactly.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So slowly but surely.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And the last phrase that we have for you today, you may have seen that Rebecca used this phrase to be honest a couple of times before explaining something.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So why does she say to be honest?

199
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To be honest is sometimes something we say in English to fill some space or some time.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We call it filler.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But it's also a way to introduce something that's negative.

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So for example, in this dialogue, she's talking about her negative experiences.

203
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You know, my job was tough.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
My experience was bad.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So she says, to be honest, it wasn't the best experience, but I learned from it.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She's saying this to introduce some things that are maybe not positive, not happy things.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So it's another way of saying, look, I'm going to tell you the truth.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It may not be something positive, but you know, this is what happened.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So to be honest, I didn't really like my last employer or something like that.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, you can even talk about this with your friends.

212
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So, hey, Marco, did you like that movie Shutter Island?

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
To be honest, I didn't really see it.

214
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I fell asleep.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Or you could say, to be honest, I didn't love it.

217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't really like it.

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Exactly.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Exactly.

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So it's a very good phrase, but don't overuse it.

221
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I think sometimes you get into the habit of using it all the time.

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And just like like, you know, well, you know, like I went to the movies like yesterday, like to be honest.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So try to keep these fillers, as you described them, to a minimum.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So don't really use them too much.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes.

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Say thoughts and ideas, nice action verbs, not too much fillers, because sometimes, especially in an interview, it makes people think that you don't really know much to say.

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah, exactly.

228
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
OK, so let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to chat a little bit more.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
OK, now I'd like to find out more about your last job.

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly.

231
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Is that right?

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, that's right.

233
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was really just treated more like an intern.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So what changed?

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, slowly but surely, I proved myself and the new editor liked me, so he promoted me to features writer.

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wow, a real step up.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, I was responsible for restaurant and food reviews mostly.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I spent three years in that position.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But to be honest, it wasn't an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long term.

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I see.

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So why did you decide to leave finally?

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I just felt that the paper couldn't offer me any new opportunities.

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I really needed a more challenging role, to be honest.

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Alright, so talking about your last employer, this is a pretty ideal thing.

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Now, do you have any advice that you can give our listeners about describing your last job?

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why did you leave your previous employer?

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, I do have a little bit of basic job advice.

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I would say don't complain about your last employer.

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't say my boss was mean, my coworkers were lazy, my company was terrible.

252
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Because usually as a person doing an interview, that makes you think that this person, if they work for you, will complain about you.

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And so I think it's important, like what Rebecca does in this dialogue, to keep it positive.

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Every negative situation can become a positive experience.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So the job was tough, but it was a good challenge, right?

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Or but, she learned how to do many new things.

257
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Exactly.

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I think this is important for anybody in any language, but in English especially, to use some of these phrases and to say, you know, I really like a challenge, or I didn't feel this was challenging enough.

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Things like this.

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
As opposed to, my old boss is so mean, he made me work on the weekends.

261
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That company is so terrible.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I mean, that kind of stuff no one wants to hear.

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, exactly, and I think it's not really useful because even if the company is the competitor, so you're not really getting the extra points for giving them like the dirty secrets of what was going on in the company.

264
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Maybe saying, oh, my coworkers, they were just so mean to me and stuff like this.

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, no, it makes you seem like a complainer, and no one wants to hire a complainer.

266
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Exactly.

267
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
All right, so this is an interesting topic we would like to hear from you.

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
