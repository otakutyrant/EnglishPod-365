00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And as you've probably noticed on our website, this is one of many different parts of a series all about having an interview in English.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is a job interview, and at this point we're at about part seven.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So today what we're going to talk about is the key question whenever you're having a job interview is they ask you to describe your key strengths.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And this is our word for vocabulary preview today, so let's take a look at it.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, so you might have heard the word strength before.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is something that you're good at.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And so key strength or key strengths, plural, would be things that you think are most important about you as far as the things that you do well.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So as we mentioned, your boss or your potential boss might ask you to describe your key strengths.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So you're going to mention a lot of adjectives, positive adjectives, saying how good of a worker you are.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's see what Rebecca has to say about her key strengths, and we'll look at those in a little bit.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How would you describe your key strengths?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, Mr.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm really focused and hardworking.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think my academic results prove this.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, true.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But how about other personal qualities?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm fun to work with.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What would you say is your most positive quality?

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hmm, that's a tough question.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I would have to say my passion.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right, so she obviously has a lot of good key strengths.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why don't we analyze a couple of those on language takeaway?

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Language takeaway.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So one of the first things that Rebecca mentions is that she's really focused.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
OK, so this word focused, what does this mean?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right, so if a person is focused, basically you're saying that you concentrate on your work.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right, and someone who's focused might be very good in a noisy office or in a place that is full of distractions, like you said, because they don't stop their work and think about the noise or move around or go talk to people.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Someone who is focused just sits down and can do a lot of work all at once.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right, so she describes herself as focused and hard working.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So hard working means basically what it sounds like, that someone works very hard.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That means they put in a lot of hours, they get their work done, they're really, really dependable.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right, so as you can see, we use the word hard working together.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So if you work hard, you don't say, I work hard.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You can say that, but if you want to use it as an adjective, you say, I am hard working.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The opposite, of course, would be lazy.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OK, so we're focused, we're hard working, and she also said that she is a good team player.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK, this is a really key phrase here because it's something that employers, so people who are hiring new staff, like to look out for, because most jobs, you don't work alone.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You work with other people.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so a team player is someone who works well in a group or works well with others.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So a team player, everyone wants to have a good team player working for their team, for their company.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And apart from being a good team player, you also want to be enthusiastic.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's right.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So this means that you are interested in what you do.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are excited about it.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's not like, oh, God, I have to do this report.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's like, oh, wow, I get to do this report.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm enthusiastic.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm really interested.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to put a lot of energy into it.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:25,000
OK, so an enthusiastic person not only can be about working, you can be enthusiastic about anything, about, I don't know, painting your house, about going on a trip.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Exactly.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Enthusiastic.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And our last word for language takeaway is also a good quality to have if you are passionate about what you do or what you're doing.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So someone who is passionate about something really, really likes that thing.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That means that they love to do it or love to see it.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Passion is the opposite of not interested.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OK, so you're really, really emotional and excited and interested in something.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So you are passionate about something.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It comes from the noun passion.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So you have a passion for painting.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe you love to paint.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So you're very passionate about painting.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So a lot of great adjectives there to describe yourself in a good way.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
OK, Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person?

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How would you describe your key strengths?

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, Mr.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm really focused and hardworking.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think my academic results prove this.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, true.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But how about other personal qualities?

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm fun to work with.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What would you say is your most positive quality?

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hmm, that's a tough question.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I would have to say my passion.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All right, so on Fluency Builder today, we've picked out three key phrases.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's take a look at the first one when Rebecca said, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OK, so this structure, I'm someone who, is something that you hear a lot of and you can actually fill in the end of that sentence with a number of different phrases.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So in here, we heard, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We could also say, I'm someone who needs structure.

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right, so we can also change the verb, right, from needs to, I'm someone who likes a challenge.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or maybe Tracy is someone who requires a lot of attention.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right, so this is a way to introduce a characteristic of yourself.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So you're telling people something about yourself.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
OK, very good.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So moving on, we also saw that Rebecca said that she is fun to work with.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm fun to work with.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
OK, so let's just treat this like a little fixed phrase.

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We say this about people all the time.

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He's fun to work with.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
She's fun to work with.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or this group is really fun to work with.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They're all really fun to work with.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that means that it's not serious, that you really enjoy doing it.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So it's a little fixed phrase that you can use to say that, you know, it's nice to work with Rebecca or that she's very, you know, not serious, not a mean person.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And finally, we have a phrase at the end, Rebecca gets a, here's a question she thinks is very difficult.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
She calls it a tough question.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And so a tough question is something that is very hard to answer.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's right.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
She says, hmm, that's a tough question.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So she's basically acknowledging the fact that the question is difficult, a tough question.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Now we can combine this word tough with other things.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can say it's a tough situation.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That means it's a hard situation to handle.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You could also say he's having a tough time.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That means that right now in his lives, there are many things that are difficult for him.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And so tough means difficult or hard or unpleasant.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, very good.

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So a lot of good stuff coming from Rebecca, mentioning all the positive things about her.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time?

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person?

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How would you describe your key strengths?

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, Mr.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm really focused and hardworking.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think my academic results prove this.

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, true.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But how about other personal qualities?

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm fun to work with.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What would you say is your most positive quality?

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hmm, that's a tough question.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But I would have to say my passion.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right, so talking about key strengths, I think it's always difficult to talk about yourself and still sound a little bit humble, right, to not sound arrogant, like saying I'm the best.

150
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right.

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, that's the key here, I think.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You want to say really good things about yourself because you're a salesperson and you're selling your personality.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But at the same time, you don't want to sound like a jerk, like, I'm the best.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm so smart.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm so clever.

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's a little bit off-putting.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It makes people uncomfortable.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I think the trick is a balance.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Right.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And I guess if you use words such as this, like, I'm focused, I'm hardworking, I'm independent, I have a passion for this, it makes you sound like you're a really good worker, but you're not arrogant.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're not saying, oh, well, I'm the best of what I do or something like that.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Right.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So you're basically saying these are my skills, but obviously I'm not the only person who has these great skills.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's right.

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, so that's all the time we have for today.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Be sure to join us next week.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We're also going to have kind of part two of this when we talk about our weaknesses.

168
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So this time we talked about our strengths, then we'll talk about weaknesses.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So we hope that you will check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you have questions or comments, leave them there for us and we'll be in touch very soon.

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
All right.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We'll see you guys there.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Bye.
