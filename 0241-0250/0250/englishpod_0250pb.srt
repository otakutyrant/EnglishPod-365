00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,160
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:07,320
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:14,060
And as you've probably noticed on our website, this is one of many different parts of a series all about having an interview in English.

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,620
This is a job interview, and at this point we're at about part seven.

6
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:18,559
That's right.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:28,699
So today what we're going to talk about is the key question whenever you're having a job interview is they ask you to describe your key strengths.

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,659
And this is our word for vocabulary preview today, so let's take a look at it.

9
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,700
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,460
Okay, so you might have heard the word strength before.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,899
This is something that you're good at.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:48,020
And so key strength or key strengths, plural, would be things that you think are most important about you as far as the things that you do well.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:48,979
That's right.

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,340
So as we mentioned, your boss or your potential boss might ask you to describe your key strengths.

15
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,719
So you're going to mention a lot of adjectives, positive adjectives, saying how good of a worker you are.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,120
So why don't we listen to our dialogue.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,459
Let's see what Rebecca has to say about her key strengths, and we'll look at those in a little bit.

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,159
Okay, Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person?

19
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:24,500
How would you describe your key strengths?

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,719
Well, Mr.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,239
Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,439
I'm really focused and hardworking.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
I think my academic results prove this.

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,560
Yes, true.

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,819
But how about other personal qualities?

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,560
Well, I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

27
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,819
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree.

28
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,219
I'm fun to work with.

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,859
What would you say is your most positive quality?

30
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,519
Hmm, that's a tough question.

31
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,000
But I would have to say my passion.

32
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,340
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,840
All right, so she obviously has a lot of good key strengths.

34
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,759
Why don't we analyze a couple of those on language takeaway?

35
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,039
Language takeaway.

36
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:21,039
So one of the first things that Rebecca mentions is that she's really focused.

37
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,219
OK, so this word focused, what does this mean?

38
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:30,900
All right, so if a person is focused, basically you're saying that you concentrate on your work.

39
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:44,919
That's right, and someone who's focused might be very good in a noisy office or in a place that is full of distractions, like you said, because they don't stop their work and think about the noise or move around or go talk to people.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,719
Someone who is focused just sits down and can do a lot of work all at once.

41
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,599
That's right, so she describes herself as focused and hard working.

42
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,460
So hard working means basically what it sounds like, that someone works very hard.

43
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,939
That means they put in a lot of hours, they get their work done, they're really, really dependable.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,840
That's right, so as you can see, we use the word hard working together.

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,699
So if you work hard, you don't say, I work hard.

46
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,860
You can say that, but if you want to use it as an adjective, you say, I am hard working.

47
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:23,099
The opposite, of course, would be lazy.

48
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,060
That's right.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,000
OK, so we're focused, we're hard working, and she also said that she is a good team player.

50
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:42,439
OK, this is a really key phrase here because it's something that employers, so people who are hiring new staff, like to look out for, because most jobs, you don't work alone.

51
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,520
You work with other people.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,099
And so a team player is someone who works well in a group or works well with others.

53
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:49,879
That's right.

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,240
So a team player, everyone wants to have a good team player working for their team, for their company.

55
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,280
And apart from being a good team player, you also want to be enthusiastic.

56
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:01,379
That's right.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,520
So this means that you are interested in what you do.

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,520
You are excited about it.

59
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,379
It's not like, oh, God, I have to do this report.

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,139
It's like, oh, wow, I get to do this report.

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,900
I'm enthusiastic.

62
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm really interested.

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,939
I'm going to put a lot of energy into it.

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,620
That's right.

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:25,600
OK, so an enthusiastic person not only can be about working, you can be enthusiastic about anything, about, I don't know, painting your house, about going on a trip.

66
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:26,620
Exactly.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,600
Enthusiastic.

68
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:28,420
All right.

69
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,560
And our last word for language takeaway is also a good quality to have if you are passionate about what you do or what you're doing.

70
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,639
So someone who is passionate about something really, really likes that thing.

71
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,139
That means that they love to do it or love to see it.

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,540
Passion is the opposite of not interested.

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,920
OK, so you're really, really emotional and excited and interested in something.

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:51,779
That's right.

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
So you are passionate about something.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,939
It comes from the noun passion.

77
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,480
So you have a passion for painting.

78
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,639
Maybe you love to paint.

79
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,000
So you're very passionate about painting.

80
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:10,060
So a lot of great adjectives there to describe yourself in a good way.

81
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,300
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

82
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,759
OK, Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person?

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,139
How would you describe your key strengths?

84
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:27,379
Well, Mr.

85
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,899
Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

86
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
I'm really focused and hardworking.

87
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,560
I think my academic results prove this.

88
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:37,199
Yes, true.

89
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,459
But how about other personal qualities?

90
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,180
Well, I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,459
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree.

92
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,879
I'm fun to work with.

93
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,500
What would you say is your most positive quality?

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,180
Hmm, that's a tough question.

95
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,660
But I would have to say my passion.

96
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,980
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

97
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,100
All right, so on Fluency Builder today, we've picked out three key phrases.

98
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:19,139
Let's take a look at the first one when Rebecca said, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

99
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:27,899
OK, so this structure, I'm someone who, is something that you hear a lot of and you can actually fill in the end of that sentence with a number of different phrases.

100
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:31,639
So in here, we heard, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

101
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,180
We could also say, I'm someone who needs structure.

102
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,319
All right, so we can also change the verb, right, from needs to, I'm someone who likes a challenge.

103
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:47,899
Or maybe Tracy is someone who requires a lot of attention.

104
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,759
Right, so this is a way to introduce a characteristic of yourself.

105
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,339
So you're telling people something about yourself.

106
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,680
OK, very good.

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,899
So moving on, we also saw that Rebecca said that she is fun to work with.

108
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,279
I'm fun to work with.

109
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,959
OK, so let's just treat this like a little fixed phrase.

110
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,439
We say this about people all the time.

111
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,620
He's fun to work with.

112
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,680
She's fun to work with.

113
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
Or this group is really fun to work with.

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,620
They're all really fun to work with.

115
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,259
So that means that it's not serious, that you really enjoy doing it.

116
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:29,259
So it's a little fixed phrase that you can use to say that, you know, it's nice to work with Rebecca or that she's very, you know, not serious, not a mean person.

117
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,079
That's right.

118
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,839
And finally, we have a phrase at the end, Rebecca gets a, here's a question she thinks is very difficult.

119
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,439
She calls it a tough question.

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,439
And so a tough question is something that is very hard to answer.

121
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,160
That's right.

122
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,399
She says, hmm, that's a tough question.

123
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,720
So she's basically acknowledging the fact that the question is difficult, a tough question.

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,259
Now we can combine this word tough with other things.

125
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:53,899
That's right.

126
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,560
You can say it's a tough situation.

127
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,860
That means it's a hard situation to handle.

128
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,279
You could also say he's having a tough time.

129
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,980
That means that right now in his lives, there are many things that are difficult for him.

130
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,019
And so tough means difficult or hard or unpleasant.

131
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,439
Okay, very good.

132
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,519
So a lot of good stuff coming from Rebecca, mentioning all the positive things about her.

133
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,980
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time?

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,060
Okay, Rebecca, now you've given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person?

135
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,439
How would you describe your key strengths?

136
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,659
Well, Mr.

137
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:36,159
Parsons, as I mentioned before, I'm someone who needs new challenges.

138
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm really focused and hardworking.

139
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,840
I think my academic results prove this.

140
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,500
Yes, true.

141
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,759
But how about other personal qualities?

142
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,419
Well, I believe I'm a good team player, but I can also work well independently.

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,740
I'm very enthusiastic and, well, I hope my colleagues would agree.

144
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,080
I'm fun to work with.

145
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,779
What would you say is your most positive quality?

146
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,460
Hmm, that's a tough question.

147
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,919
But I would have to say my passion.

148
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.

149
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:26,860
All right, so talking about key strengths, I think it's always difficult to talk about yourself and still sound a little bit humble, right, to not sound arrogant, like saying I'm the best.

150
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:27,559
Right.

151
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:28,820
Well, that's the key here, I think.

152
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,580
You want to say really good things about yourself because you're a salesperson and you're selling your personality.

153
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,940
But at the same time, you don't want to sound like a jerk, like, I'm the best.

154
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,600
I'm so smart.

155
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,240
I'm so clever.

156
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,539
That's a little bit off-putting.

157
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,840
It makes people uncomfortable.

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,559
So I think the trick is a balance.

159
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,039
Right.

160
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:57,200
And I guess if you use words such as this, like, I'm focused, I'm hardworking, I'm independent, I have a passion for this, it makes you sound like you're a really good worker, but you're not arrogant.

161
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,620
You're not saying, oh, well, I'm the best of what I do or something like that.

162
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,000
Right.

163
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:08,399
So you're basically saying these are my skills, but obviously I'm not the only person who has these great skills.

164
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,100
That's right.

165
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:11,220
Okay, so that's all the time we have for today.

166
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,080
Be sure to join us next week.

167
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,059
We're also going to have kind of part two of this when we talk about our weaknesses.

168
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,700
So this time we talked about our strengths, then we'll talk about weaknesses.

169
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,399
That's right.

170
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,299
So we hope that you will check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

171
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,940
If you have questions or comments, leave them there for us and we'll be in touch very soon.

172
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,320
All right.

173
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:29,919
We'll see you guys there.

174
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:30,240
Bye.
