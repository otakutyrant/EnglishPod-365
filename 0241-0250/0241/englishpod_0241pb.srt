00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we've got part three of an exciting series we've got for you at the elementary level.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
As you may remember, this is a series that we're studying all about a job interview.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So in the first part, we just talked about the introduction.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The second part was talking about your personal background.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And now we're going to talk about your educational background.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So the key topic here today is education.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's take a listen to this dialogue and we'll be back in a minute.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My major was English and my minor was business.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I completed my BA in 2004.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, that's right.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've always enjoyed studying.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student newspaper, which I really loved.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in York.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What did that involve?

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sure.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, okay.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So the girl was talking about her education, about her university, and she talked about some very interesting words.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So why don't we take a look at those and language takeaway?

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Language takeaway.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So at the very beginning, Mr.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Parsons, who's the interviewer here, asks Rebecca about her background and says, I see that you completed your BA in English.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, so we have an acronym there, a BA.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This stands for bachelors, or usually a four-year degree at the beginning of your university studies.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So it's a type of degree, right?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A BA is, as you say, your bachelor's degree, and it usually takes four years.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You have a bachelor of the arts, BA, but you also have a bachelor of science, which is a BS.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So as you can tell, one is for the arts, like art history, music, things like that.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The other is for sciences, like physics or chemistry.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Very good.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, so she has a BA in English, so she obviously studied the English language in university.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then she moved on to talk about her major and minor.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So as you know, a degree is not just a degree in the arts in general, but it usually has a focus or an area of focus.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So her area of focus, her major was English.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is the most important part of her studies.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So many of her courses, most of her courses at university were in English.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right, but she also has a minor in business studies.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, that means she also studied business and business studies.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's not as important as her English studies, but it was very much a part of her degree.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's say that when she was studying in university, 70% of what she studied was related to her major, English, and maybe 30% was her minor, was business studies.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And she goes on to talk about herself and her friends who describe her as a bookworm.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is a really nice adjective and very common in English.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So if you are a bookworm or you describe yourself as a bookworm, it means that you like to study a lot.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You like to read a lot of books.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So bookworm is just like what you said, is someone who really likes to read, someone who's always reading.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Maybe someone who lives in the library.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So that's why you call them a bookworm.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They live in the library or they read a lot of books.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All right, so that's the noun bookworm.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now moving on to other parts of university, when you're studying, you're not only studying English or sciences and things like that.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sometimes you also do other activities or other things.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's right.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So you have your schoolwork, which is during school, it's English and business studies for this woman, Rebecca, but you also have what you do outside of school.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is called extracurricular activities.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So it's a long word, extracurricular.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So extracurricular means it's not in the curriculum, right?

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's outside of school.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So it's not really like a specific subject or something that's related to your studies.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you don't do extracurricular activities, it's okay, right?

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
A lot of people don't do any extracurricular activities, but many people do.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
For example, writing for the school newspaper or playing soccer.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Exactly.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So those are extracurricular activities.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Anything that you want to do in university apart from studying, playing soccer, writing, et cetera.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And it's not just university.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You can do these in high school as well.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, very good.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So those are the words that we have picked out for you today.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think they're very specific to education.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I think we should go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, that's right.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My major was English and my minor was business.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I completed my BA in 2004.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes, that's right.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've always enjoyed studying.

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student newspaper, which I really loved.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What did that involve?

108
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sure.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, now, let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, okay.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right, we're back.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So now let's start off with our first phrase on Fluency Builder.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So Rebecca's talking about her father and her friends, and she says she's a bookworm, but her father always pushed us, that means her and her family members, her siblings, to succeed.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And this verb, to push us, to push someone, is very important because it's not the same as like to push a door.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Right, so it's not physically that you're pushing somebody.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's actually to motivate somebody or to inspire someone to become better at something.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So to push someone is to encourage them to do something bad.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not always a good thing.

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So she was always pushing me to do what she wanted to do, not what I wanted to do.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That means someone's always trying to influence you or to get you to do something.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So as you say, to push someone is to influence them, to motivate them, to encourage them to do something, good or bad.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Well, and Mr.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Parsons agreed with her dad's encouragement, and he said, well, it really paid off.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, this is a great verbal phrase, to pay off.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This means to have benefits, okay?

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So all of your hard work really paid off.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So you can see the results.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can see the positive results of your hard work.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It paid off.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You could even ask someone, all that hard work, did it pay off?

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So that you're basically asking, was it worth it?

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, to pay off.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And well, when she was talking about extracurricular activities, she said she was always keen on writing.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now, I think this is more common among British people to say you're keen on something, but it basically means to like.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So remember the phrase, keen on.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is the preposition here, keen on.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm keen on writing.

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So can you say that you are keen on someone?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, you can.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That means you like someone, maybe romantically.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, so it's kind of, as Catherine said, more of a British thing, but it's correct and you can use it in replacement of to like.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I think it also sounds a little bit more formal instead of saying, well, I've always liked writing.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If she says, well, I've always been keen on writing, I think it sounds nice.

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A little smarter.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All right.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And our last word, it's actually an interesting word.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It might be a little bit complicated to understand, but when she said that, but when she said that volunteering was very fulfilling and to be part of a group.

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay, fulfilling sounds a lot like the word filling, but you shouldn't confuse these two because the meaning is very different, right?

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So something that is fulfilling makes you feel really good.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You maybe, maybe you don't make money from it or you don't get a lot of praise from it, but it still makes you feel happy about life for yourself or something.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So you get satisfaction.

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now notice the pronunciation.

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You don't say full filling.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, you say fulfilling.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Fulfilling.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So the L there is kind of silent.

164
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Kind of optional.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But maybe you could ask someone, what do you find fulfilling in your life?

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Or you can ask, do you think your job is fulfilling?

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So a lot of great words there.

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A lot of interesting things related to education and not so much.

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time?

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now, if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, that's right.

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
My major was English and my minor was business.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I completed my BA in 2004.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes.

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, that's right.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I've always enjoyed studying.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

184
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student newspaper, which I really loved.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What did that involve?

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sure.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah, okay.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay.

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
All right, so talking about going to university, I think they used a really specific verb there that's worth mentioning.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She said, I attended York University in the UK.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So to attend.

196
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's right.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So you can say I studied at York University, but the more formal way of saying that I was a student at York University is to say I attended that school.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So to attend means to be a student at that place.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay.

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And what about you, Katherine?

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Did you participate in any extracurricular activities back in college?

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I did.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I participated in a lot of extracurricular activities.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was in the orchestra at my university, and I played in a lot of musical groups.

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I also was in a discussion group for politics.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And the India-Pakistan dialogue group.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And I was in a number of different film clubs.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So we would talk about film and I even helped out at the TV station for my university.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, wow.

210
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The university had a TV station.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So all of it was student directed.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So basically the students controlled the TV station.

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's really interesting.

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think these types of extracurricular activities are as many as these are maybe not as common in other places or maybe they're a little bit different.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know, for example, in the US you have all these political ones and a lot of sports and things like that.

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But you also have very strange, far ones like, I don't know, like there's a cooking club and there's even like a gardening club, I've heard.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Astronomy club.

219
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Astronomy club.

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's all types of extracurricular activities.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, what's really nice about a lot of American universities is that there are many, many resources that students can use.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And so maybe the reason there's a cooking club is because there are massive kitchens the students can use to cook food and experiment and even teachers and professors sometimes come to help.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So it's a really nice environment because everyone's teaching each other.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, it's very, very interesting.

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And we're actually curious to know how universities work in your country.

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you able to have a minor in a subject?

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because many universities don't offer this option.

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Right, they just have one major and that's all.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Right.

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Or maybe are you able to participate in extracurricular activities?

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Like sports or radio or writing?

232
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let us know.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All right.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So we'll see you guys there.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Bye.
