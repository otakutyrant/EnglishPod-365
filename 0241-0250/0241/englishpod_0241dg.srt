00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Now if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, that's right.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
My major was English and my minor was Business.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I completed my BA in 2004.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, that's right.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I've always enjoyed studying.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student newspaper, which I really loved.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What did that involve?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sure.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay.
