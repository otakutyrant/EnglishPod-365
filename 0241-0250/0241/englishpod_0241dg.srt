00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:10,080
EnglishPod.com Now if I look here, I see that you completed a BA in English.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,099
Yes, that's right.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,699
After graduating from high school in New York, I attended York University in the UK.

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,660
My major was English and my minor was Business.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,239
I completed my BA in 2004.

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,600
Yes, I'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,899
Yes, that's right.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,839
I've always enjoyed studying.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,539
My friends say I'm a bit of a bookworm, but my father always pushed us to succeed at school.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,039
Well, it looks like his encouragement paid off, Rebecca.

11
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,659
So how about extracurricular activities at university?

12
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:46,880
Well, I've always been keen on writing, so I became the editor for the university student newspaper, which I really loved.

13
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,399
Also, I volunteered for a group called Shelter to help the homeless in New York.

14
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:52,700
What did that involve?

15
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,719
Providing warm meals and shelter, especially in the winter months.

16
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,380
I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,219
I'm sure.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,379
Okay, now let's move on to your work experience, shall we?

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,359
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,340
Okay.
