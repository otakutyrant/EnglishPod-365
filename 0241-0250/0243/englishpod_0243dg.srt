00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How can I help you?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Very well.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside, or even going to a spa for the weekend.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Perfect.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This package includes round trip flights to New Hampshire.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A free airport pickup is included.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften this 30 minute ride to the countryside.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sounds good.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That is the best part.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green gardens or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wow.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Of course.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sold.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I want to book this trip and I don't care what it costs.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Money is no object.
