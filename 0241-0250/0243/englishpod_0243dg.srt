Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:08,460
How can I help you?

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,119
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,099
Very well.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:21,800
We have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside, or even going to a spa for the weekend.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,280
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,000
Perfect.

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,519
This package includes round trip flights to New Hampshire.

9
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:31,219
A free airport pickup is included.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:39,780
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften this 30 minute ride to the countryside.

11
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,380
Sounds good.

12
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,979
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

13
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,619
That is the best part.

14
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:53,020
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,240
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,219
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:15,480
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green gardens or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace.

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:16,739
Wow.

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,239
This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

20
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,060
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,799
Of course.

22
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,120
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail.

23
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:33,379
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,540
I'm sold.

25
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,079
I want to book this trip and I don't care what it costs.

26
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,719
Money is no object.
