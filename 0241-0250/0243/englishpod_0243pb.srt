00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,219
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:05,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,160
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:15,320
And sometimes you're just tired of work, you're tired of everything, you want to go somewhere for a nice romantic weekend, you take a holiday or a getaway.

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:15,939
That's right.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,120
So why don't we take a look at this word on vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,140
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,719
Okay, so Marco, the word I mentioned is getaway.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,199
It has a couple of different meanings in English.

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,300
What are we talking about today?

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:37,320
Well, to get away from someone would be to, like, leave, right, to try and stay far away.

12
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:47,759
But a getaway, so taking it as a noun, a romantic getaway, is actually to take a holiday, a romantic escape from the city, escape from your daily normal life.

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,500
That's right.

14
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:54,799
So it's usually kind of brief or sudden, almost like you're just going to sneak out and then come back in a couple of days.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,340
Exactly.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:05,500
So many people refer to them as island getaways if you go to an island or a romantic getaway if you have a romantic two-day vacation or something like this.

17
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:05,700
Right.

18
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,900
And what are you getting away from?

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,159
You're getting away from work, you're getting away from the busyness of the city, you're getting away from noise.

20
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:17,560
It's a nice way to get into the countryside, or as you said, the islands.

21
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,359
Exactly.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,640
So I think we can take a look at our dialogue.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:29,280
We actually, we're going to a travel agency called Getaway Tours, and we're going to try and see if we can book a nice romantic getaway.

24
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,959
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

25
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,159
How can I help you?

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,840
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

27
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:42,799
Very well.

28
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:51,560
We have a couple of different options, such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside, or even going to a spa for the weekend.

29
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:54,060
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,219
This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire.

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,900
A free airport pickup is included.

32
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:09,460
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften this 30-minute ride to the countryside.

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,060
Sounds good.

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,719
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

35
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,340
That is the best part.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,719
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

37
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,919
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,919
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

39
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:38,000
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush, green gardens.

40
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:45,120
Or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,939
Wow, this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

42
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,719
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Of course.

44
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,819
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail.

45
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:03,039
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

46
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,240
I'm sold.

47
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,500
I want to book this trip.

48
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,759
I don't care what it costs.

49
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,439
Money is no object.

50
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:13,680
All right, we're back.

51
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,259
So I think this sounds pretty romantic, right?

52
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,379
It sounds too good to be true.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,000
It's perfect.

54
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,960
They have butlers and food and horseback riding.

55
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:23,879
That's right.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,740
So she actually mentioned a couple of interesting words there describing where they're going to go or how they're going to spend their time.

57
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,599
So why don't we take a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

58
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,740
Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,560
Okay, so the first word has to do with where this couple is going.

60
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,099
They're going to the countryside.

61
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,120
That's right, the countryside.

62
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,800
So what exactly is the countryside?

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,419
Well, countryside or the country is the opposite of the city.

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,219
So it's anywhere that is rural or less developed than a city, not big skyscrapers or businesses or big towns.

65
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,620
It's actually pretty quiet.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,039
Okay, so usually the countryside will have a lot of natural wildlife.

67
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,160
Trees, gardens, or farms I think can be considered part of the countryside.

68
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,379
And so, yeah, that's basically the complete opposite from a city, right?

69
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,319
Yes, and that's why a lot of people take getaways to the countryside because it's as far away from the city as you can go.

70
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,980
Okay, very good.

71
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,800
And to get to the countryside, they're actually taking a round-trip flight to New Hampshire.

72
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:44,019
All right, so round-trip is an important vocabulary item when we're talking about travel because you can use this for train tickets, flight tickets, even boat tickets.

73
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,040
It means that you're going there and you're coming back.

74
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
It's basically two tickets.

75
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:54,879
Right, so the opposite would be if you buy a one-way ticket or a one-way flight.

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,399
That's right, so many people dream of buying a one-way ticket to the islands.

77
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,160
They never have to come back, but round-trip means you're going to come home at some point.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:17,600
Okay, so they're actually going round-trip to New Hampshire and also they are getting picked up at the airport where they're going to have a nice limo that's going to offer them complimentary champagne and finger foods.

79
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,439
Okay, my favorite kind of champagne.

80
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:20,379
Complimentary.

81
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,139
That's right, this means that they're not going to pay for it, right?

82
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:23,759
It's free.

83
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,420
So the company is going to pay for it.

84
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,379
You can have complimentary food, you can have complimentary service.

85
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,500
These are basically things that someone else is providing for you, you don't have to pay for them.

86
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:42,459
Yeah, even on talking about flights, sometimes people will get a complimentary upgrade to first class.

87
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,160
That means they are getting a better service for free.

88
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:45,899
Not me.

89
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,560
Hey, if you work for an airline, I would love a complimentary bump to first class.

90
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,680
And what about this finger foods?

91
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,480
What about that?

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,579
That sounds kind of strange.

93
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:04,139
Yeah, it might sound disgusting, but it's not actually fingers that you eat, it's food that you can eat with your fingers.

94
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,779
So they're like small little treats or snacks that you can have.

95
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,240
Exactly.

96
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:17,060
Usually if you go to a cocktail party or if you go to a party at a museum or an event, they'll have these little, little foods that you can pick up and eat.

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,620
You don't need a fork or a spoon.

98
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,259
Okay, so they're very small, convenient little snacks that you can just kind of pick at and pop into your mouth.

99
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:34,240
All right, and all of this they're doing because they have a 30 minute ride to the countryside, so they want to soften the 30 minute ride.

100
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:45,620
Okay, so to soften something means to make it more enjoyable or more pleasurable, because oh no, the 30 minute ride is so rough, so hard, so this makes it better.

101
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,180
Okay.

102
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:58,639
Okay, so yeah, you can soften things such as the ride to the countryside, or you can even soften someone up, so maybe give them some nice compliments so they'll be nice to you.

103
00:06:58,959 --> 00:06:59,360
That's right.

104
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,180
To soften.

105
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:00,860
Okay.

106
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:07,000
All right, so why don't we take a break and listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with language takeaway part two.

107
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,720
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,939
How can I help you?

109
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:17,660
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,579
Very well.

111
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:27,279
We have a couple of different options such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside, or even going to a spa for the weekend.

112
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,800
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

113
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,500
Perfect.

114
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,019
This package includes round trip flights to New Hampshire.

115
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,680
A free airport pickup is included.

116
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:45,300
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften this 30 minute ride to the countryside.

117
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,879
Sounds good.

118
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,459
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

119
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,120
That is the best part.

120
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,600
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

121
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,779
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

122
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,740
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

123
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:20,959
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green gardens, or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace.

124
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:22,199
Wow.

125
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,740
This sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

126
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,500
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

127
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,339
Of course.

128
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:34,600
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail.

129
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,860
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

130
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,039
I'm sold.

131
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,299
I want to book this trip.

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,559
I don't care what it costs.

133
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,299
Money is no object.

134
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:57,720
All right, we're back and now we are going to take a look at a good group of adjectives that the travel agent used to describe how great this hotel is, how great the place is.

135
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,019
Language takeaway.

136
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:14,100
Okay, so the person on the telephone representing the travel company is trying to sell something, so she is using these really, really great adjectives to make everything sound awesome.

137
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:21,440
And one of the first things she says is that you will enjoy an intimate and private time in this great hotel.

138
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,179
Okay.

139
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:30,000
So an intimate time, if something is intimate, it means it's very, I don't know, it usually means like romantic, right?

140
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,419
Romantic, cozy, but also private.

141
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:32,919
Private.

142
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,879
So something that is intimate is usually between two people.

143
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:42,860
Okay, so if they're going to have an intimate and private room, that means it's a room only for them.

144
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,120
Yes, or if someone has an intimate relationship, that means that they're romantically involved.

145
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:54,840
And the travel agent went on to describe how fabulous the restaurant is, so this adjective is really nice.

146
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:55,600
Fabulous.

147
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,519
And I think you have to say it like that.

148
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,419
Fabulous.

149
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,120
Fabulous.

150
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,159
So this means that it's just a wonderful restaurant, and some people even say totally fab.

151
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,120
Okay, can you describe someone as fabulous?

152
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,879
Not really, right?

153
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,360
He is so fabulous.

154
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
She is fabulous.

155
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,299
Really?

156
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,220
You can say that?

157
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,480
My mom says it all the time.

158
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,059
Yeah, so it also depends on, I think, your personality.

159
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,120
This is a very, very descriptive word.

160
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:27,659
So sometimes it's a bit too strong, you have to be careful, but yeah, you can describe a person, you can describe a place, you can describe a thing with the word fabulous.

161
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:34,279
Apart from having this fabulous restaurant, they also have a stunning view of the gardens.

162
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:40,100
Alright, stunning is similar to the word breathtaking or shocking in a good way.

163
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,820
It makes you really, really impressed because it's so beautiful or so unique.

164
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay, so for example, the views, the view of the beach is stunning, right?

165
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,960
Or even someone, you can say, wow, you look stunning.

166
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:55,720
That's right.

167
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,759
So this is a really great compliment, by the way.

168
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,460
Usually men say this to women, women don't say this to men.

169
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:08,580
You can describe someone's clothes as stunning, like her dress was stunning at the Oscars.

170
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,299
But if you're a man trying to give a woman a good compliment, believe me, this one works.

171
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,679
You look stunning this evening.

172
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,879
Okay, nice little tip there.

173
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,840
Using the adjective stunning, okay.

174
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:27,019
Now lush, we have lush green gardens, so we're looking, we have a stunning view of the lush green gardens.

175
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,679
This word lush.

176
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:38,360
Lush usually describes things that are organic, like plants and flowers, and we say this to mean that something is very green, very healthy, very full.

177
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:44,299
Okay, so an apple tree, full with apples, and you have a, it just looks great.

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,919
You would say it's a lush apple tree.

179
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:52,860
Right, or I could even say I've heard that the rainforests of Ecuador are very, very lush, very green.

180
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:53,820
Yeah, exactly.

181
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,639
All right, so lush, they're very abundant, very green, very healthy.

182
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:07,960
And apart from these adjectives, the sales agent also described that the country villa had recently been restored and refurbished.

183
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,259
So what about these two words?

184
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,940
Restored and refurbished.

185
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:19,340
Okay, basically what she's saying is that this house, this big villa, was recently completely remade on the inside.

186
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,659
So the appearance, the look doesn't really change.

187
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,779
It's still an old beautiful villa, but maybe the insides were old or needed to be updated.

188
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:46,500
And so that means that the plumbing, the lights, the walls, the paint, that was all restored maybe to look like the original, very, very beautiful and clean, but also it was refurbished, which means that the fittings and the carpet and maybe the lights and all the furniture, that was also new again.

189
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:54,259
Okay, so we usually hear about this sometimes in the news when they are restoring an old church or an old building.

190
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:59,100
That means they're making it, they're trying to save it and make it look like it used to.

191
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,740
They're not changing it, right?

192
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,620
They're not trying to make it look new, but they're trying to make it look like it used to look before it got old.

193
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:11,700
You know how sometimes old things are worn and they're not pretty anymore.

194
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,679
Well, what they're trying to do is make it really shiny and beautiful.

195
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,899
And refurbish is basically to give it, as you said, new carpet or sometimes new furniture and stuff like that.

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,960
So many people refurbish their homes, right?

197
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,820
That's right.

198
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,600
And it's a very, very popular thing to do with older houses.

199
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,320
You buy them, you fix them, you restore them, you refurbish them so that you want to live in them.

200
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,259
Okay.

201
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,820
So a lot of great things from this dialogue.

202
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:40,740
I think we should listen to it one more time and we'll be back in a little bit.

203
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,399
Welcome to Perfect Getaway Tours.

204
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,620
How can I help you?

205
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,299
I would like to plan a surprise getaway for me and my wife.

206
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,259
Very well.

207
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:04,000
We have a couple of different options, such as beaches, the wilderness, the countryside, or even going to a spa for the weekend.

208
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:06,480
I think something in the countryside would be nice.

209
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,139
Perfect.

210
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,659
This package includes round-trip flights to New Hampshire.

211
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,340
A free airport pickup is included.

212
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:21,940
Our VIP limousine will pick you up and provide you with complimentary champagne and finger foods to soften this 30-minute ride to the countryside.

213
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,559
Sounds good.

214
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,179
What is the hotel that we'll be staying at like?

215
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:27,799
That is the best part.

216
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,179
Your hotel is actually an old country villa that has been restored and refurbished to accommodate a maximum of 10 guests.

217
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,360
You will enjoy an intimate and private time in this very spacious and warm hotel.

218
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:44,360
Included in the price is three meals a day, excluding beverages.

219
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:57,639
You can choose to eat at the fabulous restaurant that offers a stunning view of the lush green gardens, or if you prefer, your own private butler can arrange your meal to be served in your room or outside on our terrace.

220
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,419
Wow, this sounds like something my wife would really enjoy.

221
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,159
Are there any outdoor activities we can take part in?

222
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:04,940
Of course.

223
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,279
The hotel has a stable with beautiful stallions for a very romantic horseback ride along the country trail.

224
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,500
You can also go fishing at the nearby lake or visit the local vineyard.

225
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:16,720
I'm sold.

226
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,240
I want to book this trip, and I don't care what it costs.

227
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,940
Money is no object.

228
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:37,039
All right, so talking about getaways, now the sales agent offered him options such as beach, wilderness, countryside, or even a spa.

229
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:38,259
Which one do you prefer?

230
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:39,899
For sure.

231
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:40,379
For sure.

232
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,980
So you want to go into the forest, the jungle?

233
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,460
Yes.

234
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,919
I hate to say it.

235
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,240
I think beaches are boring.

236
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,580
Sorry mom, I know you love beaches.

237
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,240
I like to do stuff when I'm away.

238
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,860
So I love the desert too, but the wilderness is somewhere where I'm outside, and I live in a city.

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,820
I don't want to go to a city.

240
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,000
So I like to go somewhere where I can walk around, hike, ride a bike, do things like that.

241
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,860
What about you?

242
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,179
I actually, I don't have like a favorite actually.

243
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,860
Sometimes it's nice for me to go to the beach and relax.

244
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,059
I do tend to get a little bit bored after maybe two days of doing nothing on the beach.

245
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:21,500
But it does give a good opportunity to do other things, beach activities like snorkeling or scuba diving, which can also be really fun.

246
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,399
But definitely I do enjoy the wilderness as well.

247
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:31,059
The jungle and rafting or camping, yeah it's good fun.

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,639
The insects can be a bit of a nuisance at times.

249
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,580
Or the rain.

250
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:37,440
Or the rain.

251
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:41,000
Camping in the snow or the rain is so horrible.

252
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:42,799
But other than that, yeah it's great.

253
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,679
I know not many people enjoy these types of outdoor getaways.

254
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:53,879
But of course, you know, you have spas, I know many people enjoy going to a spa, having a mud bath.

255
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,580
Nothing wrong with that, getting your nails done, having a massage, I mean getting the whole royal treatment like we say.

256
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,839
So this is what we want to know now is, well, when you go on vacation, what do you like to do?

257
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Do you like to get away to the tropical beaches, do you like to go to the islands or the jungle?

258
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,759
What do you like to do?

259
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,559
Let us know.

260
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,420
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

261
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,319
We hope to see you there.

262
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,539
Alright, we'll see you guys next time.

263
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:17,859
Bye.
