00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,139
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,900
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,099
My name is Catherine, and we're on the road today.

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,320
We're traveling a little bit.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:10,820
That's right.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,300
Today, we have a lesson that was requested by one of our users, and I think it's a very handy lesson.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,519
If we're traveling, we are buying tickets at a train station.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,059
That's right.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,440
So I personally love traveling by train.

10
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,140
I think it's a very romantic way to see different countries, different places.

11
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,280
We're going to learn all about how to get tickets and how to talk about different parts of a train, so let's first listen to our dialogue.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,240
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,219
Certainly, sir.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,399
This is our train schedule.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,799
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 p.m.

16
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,619
How long does it take to get there?

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,979
About 12 hours.

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,340
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

19
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:01,880
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,200
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,620
Do you serve food on a train?

22
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,359
12 hours is such a long time.

23
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,480
Yes, of course.

24
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,159
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

25
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,700
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

26
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:16,439
Great.

27
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,239
I'll take it.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,180
Here you are, sir.

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,620
Your train leaves from platform number 9 at 9 on the dot.

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,659
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time, or else you might miss your train.

31
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,599
I understand.

32
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,040
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,200
Have a great trip.

34
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:35,280
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,480
So, now we're going to take a look at a couple of words that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,120
So there are many different kinds of tickets you can purchase, you can buy for your train journey.

37
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,400
The first kind we're going to talk about is maybe the fastest.

38
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,420
This is called an express train.

39
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,180
That's right.

40
00:01:56,379 --> 00:02:02,200
So, as the name says, it's an express train, that means it's a very fast train.

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:12,479
And it depends because in different places, sometimes they call it the fast train, sometimes they call it the express train, but basically the idea is that it's a very fast train.

42
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:16,099
And it's fast usually because it stops very few times.

43
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:24,900
For example, if we want to go on the Paris to Berlin train, it won't stop in every single town, it will probably only stop a couple of times.

44
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,520
Exactly.

45
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:32,800
So, apart from the express trains that usually they'll go in the daytime, we have an overnight train.

46
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:38,479
Overnight trains are very fun, or at least they can be fun if you have a comfortable place to sleep.

47
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,919
Basically the idea is you get on the train at night, and you sleep on the train, and you get off in the morning.

48
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,719
That's right.

49
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:56,039
It's actually a very popular way of traveling, especially if you're on a budget, because well, you're basically saving yourself one night of spending the night at a hotel.

50
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:56,900
That's right.

51
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:01,020
So, you're going to have to find a place to sleep if you're taking the overnight train.

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,340
There are usually different options.

53
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:06,819
The most uncomfortable is usually a seat, like a hard seat.

54
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,800
But there are oftentimes special cars on a train where you can sleep for these overnight trips.

55
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,520
What are those called?

56
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,020
That's right.

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,460
And those are called a sleeper.

58
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,199
Sleeper cars, or you choose a sleeper seat.

59
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:18,800
Right.

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
So that's pretty easy to remember, sleep sleeper.

61
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:33,580
The sleeper seats are the seats that fold back like you're lying down, but of course most places like China and India and Vietnam, for example, have actual cars that have beds in them.

62
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:34,180
Right, right.

63
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:34,460
Yeah.

64
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:38,400
So you can, as the name says, you can actually sleep on this train.

65
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,379
Now if you're going to buy tickets, you're not going to find a sleeper train on an express train or a train that travels during the day.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,159
These are only available at night, usually.

67
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,719
That's right.

68
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,639
So sleeper car is what you want to look for if you're traveling overnight.

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,020
And in those cases, you oftentimes get hungry.

70
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:55,900
You need to eat.

71
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:56,979
So where do you go to eat?

72
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,659
That's right.

73
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,360
We're going to look for the dining car on the train.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,099
Okay.

75
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,740
So think about the word dining room.

76
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,099
Dining room, dining car, this means the place where you eat.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:06,979
That's right.

78
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:14,539
So we're going to look for a dining car and it's usually in the front of the train, I think, and you can just go and get a quick meal over there.

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,479
That's right.

80
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,579
Dining car.

81
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,240
And finally, we have another very important word here.

82
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,620
It's all about getting on and off the train.

83
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,579
So where do you do that?

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, you go to the platform, the specific platform where your train is leaving.

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,839
So in this case, this guy has to go to platform number nine.

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:42,500
So usually that means that there is a cement or a stone block where you stand, the train comes to the station, people get off, you get on.

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,980
So the place where that all happens is the platform.

88
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,540
That's right.

89
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,720
So remember that in airplanes or in airports, usually you look for a terminal.

90
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,720
For train stations, you're looking for a platform.

91
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,379
All right.

92
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,879
And that number is going to be very important.

93
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,399
So look at your ticket and find out which platform your train will be arriving or departing from.

94
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,339
That's right.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,720
Okay.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,939
So now why don't we review these words?

97
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,680
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

98
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,139
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

99
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,120
Certainly, sir.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,339
This is our train schedule.

101
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,620
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 PM.

102
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,500
How long does it take to get there?

103
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:25,899
About 12 hours.

104
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,259
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,779
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

106
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:37,139
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

107
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,540
Do you serve food on a train?

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,300
12 hours is such a long time.

109
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,379
Yes, of course.

110
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,079
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

111
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,620
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

112
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,360
Great.

113
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,180
I'll take it.

114
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,100
Here you are, sir.

115
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,540
Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

116
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,579
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train.

117
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,519
I understand.

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,939
Thank you very much.

119
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:02,800
Have a great trip.

120
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,319
Okay, so we've got some really great phrases today on Fluency Builder.

121
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:13,300
Not that many of them, but they're very useful.

122
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,860
The first one is a kind of ticket you can buy.

123
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:17,500
That's right.

124
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,240
We're looking for a one-way ticket to Brussels.

125
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,759
Okay, so a one-way ticket means that you go to Brussels, but you don't come home.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe you have a flight later or you have a car waiting for you.

127
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,879
You don't need a return ticket on that train.

128
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,899
A one-way ticket is the opposite of a round-trip ticket.

129
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,540
That's right.

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:47,800
So usually, for example, if you live in New York and you're going on vacation, you're going to buy a round-trip ticket because you need to go back to your city.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,899
But in this case, we're getting a one-way ticket, so we're just buying a ticket that will only take us there.

132
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:54,259
It's not going to bring us back.

133
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,399
Okay, one-way ticket.

134
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,300
And after that, we have a good question.

135
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,639
This is something we can ask in many, many different situations.

136
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,860
Here the person buying the ticket wants to know, how long does it take to get there?

137
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:08,959
He's talking about Brussels.

138
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:09,980
That's right.

139
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,560
So let's take a look at this structure.

140
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:20,420
We can say, how long does it take to, and then we can add another verb there.

141
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,040
So for example, we want to know the amount of time it is going to require.

142
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,899
For example, here we are asking, how long does it take to get there?

143
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,060
In this case, to Brussels.

144
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,519
We are asking how much time is needed to go to Brussels, but what if we change the last part?

145
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, there's anything.

146
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,079
We could say anything here.

147
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,740
We could say, how long does it take to bake a pizza?

148
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:49,959
Or for example, Marco, how long does it take for you to do your hair in the morning?

149
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,160
Like 20 seconds.

150
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,420
Not very long.

151
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,079
Not very long.

152
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,240
You could even change the name of the place you're going to.

153
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:58,899
So how long does it take to get to Beijing?

154
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,360
Exactly.

155
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,040
So just remember this structure when you want to ask the amount of time needed.

156
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:14,180
Of course, there are other ways, and sometimes it's very common to make a little bit of mistake saying how much time to Beijing or something like this.

157
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,220
Or how many hours.

158
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,660
We don't really say that in English.

159
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,339
We say, how much time, so how much time does it take?

160
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,740
All right.

161
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:32,059
And what about when the person that's selling the ticket said, okay, the train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

162
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,019
Okay, so I'm not really sure where this idea of a dot comes from, but I think it has to do with clocks.

163
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:47,740
So basically, when you look at a clock and all of a sudden the hand comes to 12, so it's nine o'clock, the hand is on the 12, that is on the dot.

164
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:49,080
That means exactly.

165
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:57,559
Okay, so the train is leaving at nine zero zero, not nine 30, not nine 15, it's leaving exactly at nine o'clock.

166
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,639
So we can also say this in normal speech when we're talking to our friends.

167
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,759
I could say, Marco, we're going to leave at six on the dot, any later, and we'll miss the movie.

168
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,539
So, but when you say on the dot, you're usually emphasizing that it leaves promptly.

169
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:19,240
It's not going to be late, and you're kind of emphasizing a person to be on time.

170
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,159
Yes, please don't be late because, so nine oh one, or in my case, six oh four, these are not okay because they're too late.

171
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,720
Exactly.

172
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,759
So if I say I'm going to pick you up at four o'clock on the dot, it usually means I don't really want to wait, so please be ready at four.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,679
All right, so on the dot.

174
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,740
All right, so now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

175
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,340
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

176
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:51,379
Certainly, sir.

177
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,539
This is our train schedule.

178
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,960
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 p.m.

179
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,740
How long does it take to get there?

180
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,139
About 12 hours.

181
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,500
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

182
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,019
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

183
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,360
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

184
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,820
Do you serve food on a train?

185
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,539
I think 12 hours is such a long time.

186
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:16,639
Yes, of course.

187
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,299
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

188
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,860
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

189
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:24,600
Great.

190
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,399
I'll take it.

191
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,340
Here you are, sir.

192
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,720
Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

193
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:34,820
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time, or else you might miss your train.

194
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,759
I understand.

195
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,179
Thank you very much.

196
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,039
Have a great trip.

197
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,879
All right, so you mentioned you really like to travel on trains.

198
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,279
I do.

199
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,059
Why is that?

200
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,340
Well, I like that trains are kind of slow.

201
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,879
So when you're...

202
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,700
Well, many trains are slow.

203
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,419
Some trains, as we said, like express trains are faster.

204
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:03,080
But if you're traveling in a new place, it's a wonderful way to see the country because maybe you're going from one city to another city.

205
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,559
Well, it's nice to see what's in between cities.

206
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:05,960
Exactly.

207
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,440
So that's why I like to be on trains.

208
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:17,080
I actually also really enjoy taking the overnight trains because I sometimes get a little bit uncomfortable if I travel for too long, for example, on an airplane or a car.

209
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,179
So if I fall asleep and I wake up where I wanted to go, it's really nice.

210
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,139
Well, I think it's nice also to be kind of rolled asleep, lulled asleep by the train.

211
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,720
Have you had any very memorable train experiences?

212
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,299
Traveling around, I have met some interesting people and actually local people.

213
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:44,120
So they start talking to you and really curious because obviously you're a foreigner in their country and try to get to know you and maybe even give you a little bit of advice.

214
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:51,039
And if you don't speak the language, it's even a little bit more interesting because you're trying to communicate and you pick up a lot of words.

215
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:52,279
That's true.

216
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,820
I actually heard some really interesting stories from people who took the Trans-Siberian Railway from Beijing to Moscow.

217
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,799
They said, the more vodka you drink, the more foreign languages you speak.

218
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,620
I don't know if any of our users have done that.

219
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,259
You guys should let us know if you have any fun train travel experiences.

220
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,919
I know Marco certainly has some.

221
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,860
I've got some of my own.

222
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:14,539
So we'll all have to share on our website, EnglishPod.com.

223
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,779
And if you have any other questions, we'll see you guys there.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,259
Bye.

225
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:17,559
Bye.
