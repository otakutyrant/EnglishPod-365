00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and we're on the road today.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're traveling a little bit.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today, we have a lesson that was requested by one of our users, and I think it's a very handy lesson.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If we're traveling, we are buying tickets at a train station.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So I personally love traveling by train.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I think it's a very romantic way to see different countries, different places.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're going to learn all about how to get tickets and how to talk about different parts of a train, so let's first listen to our dialogue.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Certainly, sir.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is our train schedule.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 p.m.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How long does it take to get there?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
About 12 hours.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Do you serve food on a train?

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
12 hours is such a long time.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, of course.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Great.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll take it.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here you are, sir.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Your train leaves from platform number 9 at 9 on the dot.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time, or else you might miss your train.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I understand.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you very much.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Have a great trip.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, now we're going to take a look at a couple of words that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So there are many different kinds of tickets you can purchase, you can buy for your train journey.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The first kind we're going to talk about is maybe the fastest.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is called an express train.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's right.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So, as the name says, it's an express train, that means it's a very fast train.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And it depends because in different places, sometimes they call it the fast train, sometimes they call it the express train, but basically the idea is that it's a very fast train.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it's fast usually because it stops very few times.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For example, if we want to go on the Paris to Berlin train, it won't stop in every single town, it will probably only stop a couple of times.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Exactly.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, apart from the express trains that usually they'll go in the daytime, we have an overnight train.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Overnight trains are very fun, or at least they can be fun if you have a comfortable place to sleep.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Basically the idea is you get on the train at night, and you sleep on the train, and you get off in the morning.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's actually a very popular way of traveling, especially if you're on a budget, because well, you're basically saving yourself one night of spending the night at a hotel.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's right.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So, you're going to have to find a place to sleep if you're taking the overnight train.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There are usually different options.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The most uncomfortable is usually a seat, like a hard seat.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But there are oftentimes special cars on a train where you can sleep for these overnight trips.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are those called?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And those are called a sleeper.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sleeper cars, or you choose a sleeper seat.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Right.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So that's pretty easy to remember, sleep sleeper.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The sleeper seats are the seats that fold back like you're lying down, but of course most places like China and India and Vietnam, for example, have actual cars that have beds in them.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Right, right.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So you can, as the name says, you can actually sleep on this train.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now if you're going to buy tickets, you're not going to find a sleeper train on an express train or a train that travels during the day.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
These are only available at night, usually.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So sleeper car is what you want to look for if you're traveling overnight.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And in those cases, you oftentimes get hungry.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You need to eat.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So where do you go to eat?

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We're going to look for the dining car on the train.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So think about the word dining room.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Dining room, dining car, this means the place where you eat.

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So we're going to look for a dining car and it's usually in the front of the train, I think, and you can just go and get a quick meal over there.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Dining car.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And finally, we have another very important word here.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's all about getting on and off the train.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So where do you do that?

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, you go to the platform, the specific platform where your train is leaving.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So in this case, this guy has to go to platform number nine.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So usually that means that there is a cement or a stone block where you stand, the train comes to the station, people get off, you get on.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So the place where that all happens is the platform.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So remember that in airplanes or in airports, usually you look for a terminal.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For train stations, you're looking for a platform.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
All right.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And that number is going to be very important.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So look at your ticket and find out which platform your train will be arriving or departing from.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's right.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So now why don't we review these words?

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Certainly, sir.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is our train schedule.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 PM.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How long does it take to get there?

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
About 12 hours.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you serve food on a train?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
12 hours is such a long time.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, of course.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Great.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll take it.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Here you are, sir.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I understand.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you very much.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Have a great trip.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, so we've got some really great phrases today on Fluency Builder.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Not that many of them, but they're very useful.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The first one is a kind of ticket you can buy.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We're looking for a one-way ticket to Brussels.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay, so a one-way ticket means that you go to Brussels, but you don't come home.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe you have a flight later or you have a car waiting for you.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You don't need a return ticket on that train.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A one-way ticket is the opposite of a round-trip ticket.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So usually, for example, if you live in New York and you're going on vacation, you're going to buy a round-trip ticket because you need to go back to your city.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But in this case, we're getting a one-way ticket, so we're just buying a ticket that will only take us there.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's not going to bring us back.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, one-way ticket.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And after that, we have a good question.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is something we can ask in many, many different situations.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Here the person buying the ticket wants to know, how long does it take to get there?

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He's talking about Brussels.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So let's take a look at this structure.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We can say, how long does it take to, and then we can add another verb there.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So for example, we want to know the amount of time it is going to require.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
For example, here we are asking, how long does it take to get there?

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
In this case, to Brussels.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We are asking how much time is needed to go to Brussels, but what if we change the last part?

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well, there's anything.

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We could say anything here.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We could say, how long does it take to bake a pizza?

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Or for example, Marco, how long does it take for you to do your hair in the morning?

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like 20 seconds.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Not very long.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Not very long.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You could even change the name of the place you're going to.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So how long does it take to get to Beijing?

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Exactly.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So just remember this structure when you want to ask the amount of time needed.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Of course, there are other ways, and sometimes it's very common to make a little bit of mistake saying how much time to Beijing or something like this.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Or how many hours.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We don't really say that in English.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We say, how much time, so how much time does it take?

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And what about when the person that's selling the ticket said, okay, the train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, so I'm not really sure where this idea of a dot comes from, but I think it has to do with clocks.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So basically, when you look at a clock and all of a sudden the hand comes to 12, so it's nine o'clock, the hand is on the 12, that is on the dot.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That means exactly.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, so the train is leaving at nine zero zero, not nine 30, not nine 15, it's leaving exactly at nine o'clock.

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So we can also say this in normal speech when we're talking to our friends.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I could say, Marco, we're going to leave at six on the dot, any later, and we'll miss the movie.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So, but when you say on the dot, you're usually emphasizing that it leaves promptly.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's not going to be late, and you're kind of emphasizing a person to be on time.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes, please don't be late because, so nine oh one, or in my case, six oh four, these are not okay because they're too late.

171
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Exactly.

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So if I say I'm going to pick you up at four o'clock on the dot, it usually means I don't really want to wait, so please be ready at four.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All right, so on the dot.

174
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right, so now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hi, I would like to purchase a one-way ticket to Brussels, please.

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Certainly, sir.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is our train schedule.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at 9 p.m.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How long does it take to get there?

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
About 12 hours.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If you'd like, you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train, which is a bit less expensive.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah, I think that's the best option.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Do you serve food on a train?

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I think 12 hours is such a long time.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes, of course.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There is a dining car towards the end of the train where they serve meals at all times.

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Great.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll take it.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Here you are, sir.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Remember to be here at least 30 minutes before your scheduled departure time, or else you might miss your train.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I understand.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you very much.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have a great trip.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
All right, so you mentioned you really like to travel on trains.

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I do.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Why is that?

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, I like that trains are kind of slow.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So when you're...

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, many trains are slow.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Some trains, as we said, like express trains are faster.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But if you're traveling in a new place, it's a wonderful way to see the country because maybe you're going from one city to another city.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, it's nice to see what's in between cities.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Exactly.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So that's why I like to be on trains.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I actually also really enjoy taking the overnight trains because I sometimes get a little bit uncomfortable if I travel for too long, for example, on an airplane or a car.

209
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So if I fall asleep and I wake up where I wanted to go, it's really nice.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, I think it's nice also to be kind of rolled asleep, lulled asleep by the train.

211
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Have you had any very memorable train experiences?

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Traveling around, I have met some interesting people and actually local people.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So they start talking to you and really curious because obviously you're a foreigner in their country and try to get to know you and maybe even give you a little bit of advice.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And if you don't speak the language, it's even a little bit more interesting because you're trying to communicate and you pick up a lot of words.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's true.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I actually heard some really interesting stories from people who took the Trans-Siberian Railway from Beijing to Moscow.

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They said, the more vodka you drink, the more foreign languages you speak.

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know if any of our users have done that.

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You guys should let us know if you have any fun train travel experiences.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I know Marco certainly has some.

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've got some of my own.

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So we'll all have to share on our website, EnglishPod.com.

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And if you have any other questions, we'll see you guys there.

224
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bye.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bye.
