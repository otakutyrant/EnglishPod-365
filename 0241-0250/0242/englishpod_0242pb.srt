00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very technical, very advanced lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is all about one of my favorite subjects.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to talk about music, but specifically we're going to talk about the piano and learning how to play the piano.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we're going to talk about very specific vocab related to this instrument.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Right.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So piano and playing music, not listening to music.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we're going to hear a lot of interesting words and phrases here.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Some of them actually come from foreign languages like Italian.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So listen up, we'll be back in a moment.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And when we come back, we'll be talking about what these words and phrases mean.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hi, Cody, how did practicing go this week?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, I had several tests and an oral presentation this week, so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But I think I mastered the tricky section.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Great.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the 16th notes.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now let's take a look at this tricky section.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Charlene, before I start, I was wondering if it was okay if I put a small crescendo in here and then a decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hmm.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It might work.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll have to hear it.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Show me what you've done.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Not bad.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It was horrible.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I played it much better at home.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's just nerves.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just play the right hand for now.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, ta, ti, triple e, ti.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Good.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Good.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't forget the accidentals.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The key signature says that note should be a G sharp, but now it's a G natural.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now add the bass clef.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, you're going too fast.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is that better?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Much better.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What was that?

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sorry.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's okay.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Keep going.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Watch your dynamics.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Keep your elbows lifted.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Remember to stroke the keys.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't pound.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's better.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or as more so as your musicianship.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All right, we're back.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So you probably noticed that there are a lot of ways to describe certain aspects of playing the piano.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They talked about scales and all that stuff.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So why don't we take a deeper look at this vocab in Language Takeaway Part 1.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Language Takeaway Okay, so the first part of the lesson is the warm up.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's when we start to get our fingers moving and really stretch out.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is an important part of any musician's routine because it's also a way to practice some very basic, very fundamental things, the first of which is a scale.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, so actually Cody started warming up with some scales.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So what exactly are scales?

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well basically there are different musical notes.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Some people know them as do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Some people call them C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But each of those and many others have scales, so that's eight notes together.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so basically when you're playing scales, you're just playing a sequence of these eight notes.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right, going up or down.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, to warm up.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And what about an arpeggio?

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think this is Italian, right?

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Definitely.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Arpeggio is another kind of warm up where you're not playing every single note, you're playing some notes in a scale.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Alright, so da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's an arpeggio.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, very good.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So as you said, these are usually for warm ups, right?

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, they're also very important because they come into play later when you're talking about the key that a song or piece of music is in.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So this helps you memorize the key that some music is in.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, very good.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I think related to this is the rhythm of the piece that you're playing.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So rhythm is really important.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Some people can even say, you know, he's got rhythm, or they have rhythm.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's a way to describe the beat of a kind of music.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So sometimes it has to do with how fast or how slow something is.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Other times it has to do with the way that the notes work together.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
For example, a steady beat would be one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is a complicated beat.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It goes ta, ti, tripoli, ta, ti, tripoli.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So this is a very difficult kind of rhythm.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so the rhythm is just kind of, it gives you how fast, how slow it is, and I guess if you can take a look at notes and you can play it in many different rhythms, but not necessarily they're going to sound correct.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right, and actually it's interesting.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In English we also have a group of instruments that are called rhythm instruments.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So this would be like the drums.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, so it gives the beat.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Very good.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And well, moving on, I think some other Italian words popped up in here when they talked about crescendo and decrescendo.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right, so crescendo is when something becomes louder.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I can make a crescendo, right?

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But a decrescendo, de in Italian, just like in English, means it's the opposite.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So it means it's getting really softer.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, and what about pianissimo?

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Pianissimo is basically an indication.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It also comes from Italian.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's an indication that a player, a musician, should play something very, very, very quietly.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's almost like a whisper.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, so these three words have to do with the volume of, or how loud or not so loud you play the instrument.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, very good.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And well, moving on now, we talk about accidentals.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, this is important.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Remember earlier we were talking about scales.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, for example, the G scale has one sharp.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So that's an F sharp.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So if I'm playing it on the piano, there are seven white keys and one black key.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay, so actually here they mention G sharp and then something like G natural.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All this just like for everyone that's out there is complete Chinese to me.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have no idea what this is all about.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So you have the accidentals and G sharp and you're describing something about sharpness with accidentals.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So basically if you look at a piano, you have white keys.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Those are naturals.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They don't have a sharp or a flat.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The sharps and flats are actually played on the black keys.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Usually it's a half step from a normal note.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So G, it's a half step.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We're talking about different keys.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So if something is in the key of G, and all of you music people know what this is, key of G, there's one accidental.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's the accidental?

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's always F sharp.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And so an accidental means a sharp or a flat in that key.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And when we talk about sharps on the piano, they're basically the black keys.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, sharps and flats can both be black keys.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, very good.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And well, apart from accidentals and G sharp, G natural, the teacher also talked about a bass clef.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, this is important for people who play lower instruments like the bass, you know, the upright bass, that big one, or people who play the piano, obviously, this represents a way of writing the lower notes.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So you see the lines, those five lines on paper, and people write the notes.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, sometimes they're for higher instruments, you know, the flute or the trumpet.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But sometimes when they're for lower instruments, like the the left hand of a piano or for the upright bass, you have to write it in a special register, a special part of the sound kind of continuum.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And that's the treble.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's the bass clef.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So basically, if anyone has ever seen piano notes, it tells you what to play with your left hand and your right hand.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I imagine the bass clef will be everything that's on your left hand because that sounds like deeper, graver, right?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, it's lower.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So it's lower on the scale instead of like up high up here where it's on the treble clef.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
All right.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So Oh, so the opposite would be the treble clef.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The treble clef is up higher.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's most other instruments like the trumpet.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The bass clef is for lower instruments.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And that just means that the way that you read the music on the page is a little bit different.

165
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, very good.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And well, we also got into things like tempo and the piece that was described as andante.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Andante.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is a very Italian word.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so andante means that something is played slowly.

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So apart from andante, if so it's a style or a tempo.

172
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I guess tempo is the speed of which is played, right?

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's right.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But you're right to say that it's also a style because in many symphonies, for example, there's a movement, a part of the symphony that's called the andante.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And that's when everything starts to get slow and serious or pretty.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I've heard, I don't know, in piano, I've heard of something called staccato.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I think this is also related to tempo, right?

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Staccato is the way that you play something.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So instead of having these long, pretty notes, you're playing them like this.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They're very, very sharp.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Right, like a machine gun.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay, so but it's not related to the tempo.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's kind of more just like the way that you press the keys.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Exactly.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a style for playing.

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
All right, well, the teacher also told the student to be careful where they lift the foot off the pedal.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And the student said, oh, I'm just so sorry, the stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, so an octave is really, really important in music.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Like we were talking about earlier with a scale, a scale is eight notes.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, the the root, the place the word octave comes from is the number eight, like an octagon.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So octave means eight notes together, or like low C, high C, that's an octave.

193
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So think about the piano when you're putting your fingers on the keys.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because covering eight keys means you have to stretch your thumb and your pinky out really, really far.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And so he's saying, sorry, it's hard for me to do this because the octave, that stretch is really hard for my hand.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right, okay.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So this is different from an eighth, right?

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, it depends.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you talking about eighth note?

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't know, because it just came into the mind, because an octave is eight and an eighth note is different, I imagine.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, well, you heard in the dialogue, sixteenth note, eighth note.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's actually talking about the length of a note, how long you hold it.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So basically, you're saying it's the way you measure the music, it can have four count or three count, but you divide that into pieces.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's like a pie in math where you divide it into pieces.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So if it's a sixteenth note or an eighth note, that's the length based on the kind of music you're playing.

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I imagine sixteenth note is shorter than eighth.

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, at least I got that one right.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And thirty-second note is shorter than a sixteenth note.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Wow, you have all the way up to thirty-second.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Sixty-fourth note is shorter.

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It gets very complicated, very mathy.

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
All right.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And towards the end, the teacher recommended for Cody to watch his dynamics.

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What does she mean with watch your dynamics?

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I used to get this all the time in music.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So you're concentrating on your music, you're playing, you're getting the notes, and Cody is stretching his hands, the octaves are so far away, and he forgets to play it loud or soft.

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, okay.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because on the page it says, like we heard earlier, decrescendo.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So get much, much softer.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So Cody completely forgot, he's not listening, he's not reading the page and seeing what it says about the volume of the music.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So basically the dynamics are like the instructions of how loud to play it or not so loud.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So does it say pianissimo?

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Or the opposite, does it say forte?

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And it'll actually say this on the notes.

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Forte, it'll say that.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
F-O-R-T-E.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Or sometimes just F.

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, okay.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So P is piano, that means, like we said earlier, quiet, pianissimo is P-P-P, it's very, very quiet.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
F is forte, loud.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay, so I think, well, if anyone out there plays an instrument, you can relate and you can maybe know about these things that you may know it in your original language.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know many people who play musical instruments and don't really know the technical words in their original language.

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I mean, things like andante and pianissimo, things like this, I think are universal, right?

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They're used in whatever language.

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Exactly, very widely used.

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But things like the accidentals or bass clef or scales and stuff like that, I think it's obviously different languages.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
For example, you know Italian, like scales or accidentals, do you use it?

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They're different.

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They're different, right?

243
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
All of the other words.

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So the instructions on the page, because music is shared all over the world, the instructions on the page are almost always in Italian, so piano, andante, or they're in German music.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But everything else, scales, octaves, these are all in your native language.

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And so they're very, very important to study if you want to play and I think very, very useful if you want to study an instrument.

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, of course.

248
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think it's also a very good idea to just have a general knowledge about these things because sometimes it's nice to know a little bit about it and maybe if a friend is talking about music, you can maybe understand a little bit more about what it's like.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Or if you see music, a sheet of music, you can now more or less know what's going on with all those drawings and little scribbles there.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And if you have any questions, of course you're welcome to come to our website and ask or share your experiences as Marco has just said.

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So please come to EnglishPod.com.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We hope to see you there.

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
