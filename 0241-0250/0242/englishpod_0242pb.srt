00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,940
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,119
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very technical, very advanced lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,720
This is all about one of my favorite subjects.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,400
That's right.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,100
We're going to talk about music, but specifically we're going to talk about the piano and learning how to play the piano.

7
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:24,980
So we're going to talk about very specific vocab related to this instrument.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:25,539
Right.

9
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,699
So piano and playing music, not listening to music.

10
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:29,120
Right.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,420
Right.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,100
So we're going to hear a lot of interesting words and phrases here.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,820
Some of them actually come from foreign languages like Italian.

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,159
So listen up, we'll be back in a moment.

15
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:40,479
And when we come back, we'll be talking about what these words and phrases mean.

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,859
Hi, Cody, how did practicing go this week?

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,439
Well, I had several tests and an oral presentation this week, so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page.

18
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,619
But I think I mastered the tricky section.

19
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:58,100
Great.

20
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,240
Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,040
Good.

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:06,500
Good.

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,480
This week, work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the 16th notes.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,939
Now let's take a look at this tricky section.

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:24,140
Charlene, before I start, I was wondering if it was okay if I put a small crescendo in here and then a decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here.

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:24,959
Hmm.

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,900
It might work.

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,379
I'll have to hear it.

29
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:28,939
Show me what you've done.

30
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,299
Not bad.

31
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,719
It was horrible.

32
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,819
I played it much better at home.

33
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,280
It's just nerves.

34
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,700
Just play the right hand for now.

35
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:56,640
One, two, three, four, five, six, ta, ti, triple e, ti.

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,200
Good.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,599
Good.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,359
Don't forget the accidentals.

39
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,379
The key signature says that note should be a G sharp, but now it's a G natural.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
Now add the bass clef.

41
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,620
Oh, you're going too fast.

42
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,680
Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.

43
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,759
Is that better?

44
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:18,520
Yes.

45
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,360
Much better.

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,879
Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,159
What was that?

48
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:24,300
Sorry.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,620
The stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

50
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,580
That's okay.

51
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:28,259
Keep going.

52
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,639
You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds.

53
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,479
Watch your dynamics.

54
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,539
Keep your elbows lifted.

55
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,000
Remember to stroke the keys.

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,900
Don't pound.

57
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,340
That's better.

58
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:49,599
Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or as more so as your musicianship.

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,240
All right, we're back.

60
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,800
So you probably noticed that there are a lot of ways to describe certain aspects of playing the piano.

61
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,159
They talked about scales and all that stuff.

62
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,840
So why don't we take a deeper look at this vocab in Language Takeaway Part 1.

63
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,219
Language Takeaway Okay, so the first part of the lesson is the warm up.

64
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,599
That's when we start to get our fingers moving and really stretch out.

65
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:30,240
This is an important part of any musician's routine because it's also a way to practice some very basic, very fundamental things, the first of which is a scale.

66
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
Okay, so actually Cody started warming up with some scales.

67
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,520
So what exactly are scales?

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,319
Well basically there are different musical notes.

69
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,340
Some people know them as do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do.

70
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,300
Some people call them C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C.

71
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,699
But each of those and many others have scales, so that's eight notes together.

72
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,159
Okay, so basically when you're playing scales, you're just playing a sequence of these eight notes.

73
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,900
Right, going up or down.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,979
Okay, to warm up.

75
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,860
And what about an arpeggio?

76
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,159
I think this is Italian, right?

77
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:05,699
Definitely.

78
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:12,219
Arpeggio is another kind of warm up where you're not playing every single note, you're playing some notes in a scale.

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,400
Alright, so da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,420
That's an arpeggio.

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,639
Okay, very good.

82
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,259
So as you said, these are usually for warm ups, right?

83
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:29,680
Yeah, they're also very important because they come into play later when you're talking about the key that a song or piece of music is in.

84
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,740
So this helps you memorize the key that some music is in.

85
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,800
Okay, very good.

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,100
So I think related to this is the rhythm of the piece that you're playing.

87
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,139
That's right.

88
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,319
So rhythm is really important.

89
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,060
Some people can even say, you know, he's got rhythm, or they have rhythm.

90
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,060
It's a way to describe the beat of a kind of music.

91
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,939
So sometimes it has to do with how fast or how slow something is.

92
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,420
Other times it has to do with the way that the notes work together.

93
00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:02,899
For example, a steady beat would be one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

94
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:04,319
This is a complicated beat.

95
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:08,120
It goes ta, ti, tripoli, ta, ti, tripoli.

96
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,579
So this is a very difficult kind of rhythm.

97
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:22,779
Okay, so the rhythm is just kind of, it gives you how fast, how slow it is, and I guess if you can take a look at notes and you can play it in many different rhythms, but not necessarily they're going to sound correct.

98
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,819
Right, and actually it's interesting.

99
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,779
In English we also have a group of instruments that are called rhythm instruments.

100
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,319
So this would be like the drums.

101
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,879
Okay, so it gives the beat.

102
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,240
Yes.

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,079
Very good.

104
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:41,040
And well, moving on, I think some other Italian words popped up in here when they talked about crescendo and decrescendo.

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,339
Right, so crescendo is when something becomes louder.

106
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,180
So I can make a crescendo, right?

107
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,199
But a decrescendo, de in Italian, just like in English, means it's the opposite.

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,680
So it means it's getting really softer.

109
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,980
Okay, and what about pianissimo?

110
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,120
Pianissimo is basically an indication.

111
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,339
It also comes from Italian.

112
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,000
It's an indication that a player, a musician, should play something very, very, very quietly.

113
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,620
It's almost like a whisper.

114
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:18,279
Okay, so these three words have to do with the volume of, or how loud or not so loud you play the instrument.

115
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:18,939
That's right.

116
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:19,959
Okay, very good.

117
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,060
And well, moving on now, we talk about accidentals.

118
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,720
Okay, this is important.

119
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,779
Remember earlier we were talking about scales.

120
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,100
Well, for example, the G scale has one sharp.

121
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,740
So that's an F sharp.

122
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,579
So if I'm playing it on the piano, there are seven white keys and one black key.

123
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,339
Okay, so actually here they mention G sharp and then something like G natural.

124
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,259
All this just like for everyone that's out there is complete Chinese to me.

125
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,759
I have no idea what this is all about.

126
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:58,240
So you have the accidentals and G sharp and you're describing something about sharpness with accidentals.

127
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,899
That's right.

128
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,620
So basically if you look at a piano, you have white keys.

129
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,100
Those are naturals.

130
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,959
They don't have a sharp or a flat.

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,759
The sharps and flats are actually played on the black keys.

132
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,120
Usually it's a half step from a normal note.

133
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,980
So G, it's a half step.

134
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,100
We're talking about different keys.

135
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:27,199
So if something is in the key of G, and all of you music people know what this is, key of G, there's one accidental.

136
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,980
What's the accidental?

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,019
It's always F sharp.

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,920
And so an accidental means a sharp or a flat in that key.

139
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:33,459
Okay.

140
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,379
And when we talk about sharps on the piano, they're basically the black keys.

141
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:37,759
Yes.

142
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,860
Well, sharps and flats can both be black keys.

143
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,899
Okay, very good.

144
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:48,240
And well, apart from accidentals and G sharp, G natural, the teacher also talked about a bass clef.

145
00:07:49,240 --> 00:08:02,180
Okay, this is important for people who play lower instruments like the bass, you know, the upright bass, that big one, or people who play the piano, obviously, this represents a way of writing the lower notes.

146
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:02,660
Okay.

147
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,019
Okay.

148
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:06,899
So you see the lines, those five lines on paper, and people write the notes.

149
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,120
Well, sometimes they're for higher instruments, you know, the flute or the trumpet.

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:22,160
But sometimes when they're for lower instruments, like the the left hand of a piano or for the upright bass, you have to write it in a special register, a special part of the sound kind of continuum.

151
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,420
And that's the treble.

152
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:24,740
That's the bass clef.

153
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,279
Okay.

154
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:33,000
So basically, if anyone has ever seen piano notes, it tells you what to play with your left hand and your right hand.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,500
So I imagine the bass clef will be everything that's on your left hand because that sounds like deeper, graver, right?

156
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,299
Yeah, it's lower.

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,779
So it's lower on the scale instead of like up high up here where it's on the treble clef.

158
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:45,519
All right.

159
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,740
So Oh, so the opposite would be the treble clef.

160
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,220
That's right.

161
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,600
The treble clef is up higher.

162
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,419
It's most other instruments like the trumpet.

163
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
The bass clef is for lower instruments.

164
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:57,779
And that just means that the way that you read the music on the page is a little bit different.

165
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,860
Okay, very good.

166
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:07,059
And well, we also got into things like tempo and the piece that was described as andante.

167
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:08,120
Andante.

168
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:09,659
This is a very Italian word.

169
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,820
Okay, so andante means that something is played slowly.

170
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:13,580
Okay.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,159
So apart from andante, if so it's a style or a tempo.

172
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,200
I guess tempo is the speed of which is played, right?

173
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,700
That's right.

174
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:30,100
But you're right to say that it's also a style because in many symphonies, for example, there's a movement, a part of the symphony that's called the andante.

175
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,559
And that's when everything starts to get slow and serious or pretty.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,899
I've heard, I don't know, in piano, I've heard of something called staccato.

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,840
And I think this is also related to tempo, right?

178
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,259
Staccato is the way that you play something.

179
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:48,960
So instead of having these long, pretty notes, you're playing them like this.

180
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,120
They're very, very sharp.

181
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:51,960
Right, like a machine gun.

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,299
Okay, so but it's not related to the tempo.

183
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,399
It's kind of more just like the way that you press the keys.

184
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:58,820
Exactly.

185
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,240
It's a style for playing.

186
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:00,860
Okay.

187
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,240
All right, well, the teacher also told the student to be careful where they lift the foot off the pedal.

188
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,799
And the student said, oh, I'm just so sorry, the stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

189
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,159
Okay, so an octave is really, really important in music.

190
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,379
Like we were talking about earlier with a scale, a scale is eight notes.

191
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:27,240
Well, the the root, the place the word octave comes from is the number eight, like an octagon.

192
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:35,899
So octave means eight notes together, or like low C, high C, that's an octave.

193
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,539
So think about the piano when you're putting your fingers on the keys.

194
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:44,019
Because covering eight keys means you have to stretch your thumb and your pinky out really, really far.

195
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:51,120
And so he's saying, sorry, it's hard for me to do this because the octave, that stretch is really hard for my hand.

196
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,000
Right, okay.

197
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,259
So this is different from an eighth, right?

198
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,799
Well, it depends.

199
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,779
Are you talking about eighth note?

200
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,399
I don't know, because it just came into the mind, because an octave is eight and an eighth note is different, I imagine.

201
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,399
Yeah, well, you heard in the dialogue, sixteenth note, eighth note.

202
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,820
That's actually talking about the length of a note, how long you hold it.

203
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,500
Okay.

204
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:18,500
So basically, you're saying it's the way you measure the music, it can have four count or three count, but you divide that into pieces.

205
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,940
It's like a pie in math where you divide it into pieces.

206
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,460
So if it's a sixteenth note or an eighth note, that's the length based on the kind of music you're playing.

207
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:28,659
So I imagine sixteenth note is shorter than eighth.

208
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,100
Yes.

209
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,240
Okay, at least I got that one right.

210
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,860
And thirty-second note is shorter than a sixteenth note.

211
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,200
Wow, you have all the way up to thirty-second.

212
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,539
Sixty-fourth note is shorter.

213
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:37,440
Okay.

214
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,740
It gets very complicated, very mathy.

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,419
All right.

216
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,460
And towards the end, the teacher recommended for Cody to watch his dynamics.

217
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,940
What does she mean with watch your dynamics?

218
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,620
I used to get this all the time in music.

219
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:59,399
So you're concentrating on your music, you're playing, you're getting the notes, and Cody is stretching his hands, the octaves are so far away, and he forgets to play it loud or soft.

220
00:11:59,519 --> 00:11:59,960
Oh, okay.

221
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,139
Because on the page it says, like we heard earlier, decrescendo.

222
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,779
So get much, much softer.

223
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:12,740
So Cody completely forgot, he's not listening, he's not reading the page and seeing what it says about the volume of the music.

224
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:19,360
So basically the dynamics are like the instructions of how loud to play it or not so loud.

225
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,720
So does it say pianissimo?

226
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,220
Or the opposite, does it say forte?

227
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
And it'll actually say this on the notes.

228
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,179
Forte, it'll say that.

229
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,159
F-O-R-T-E.

230
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,259
Or sometimes just F.

231
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,179
Oh, okay.

232
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:38,620
So P is piano, that means, like we said earlier, quiet, pianissimo is P-P-P, it's very, very quiet.

233
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,019
F is forte, loud.

234
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:52,340
Okay, so I think, well, if anyone out there plays an instrument, you can relate and you can maybe know about these things that you may know it in your original language.

235
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:59,259
I know many people who play musical instruments and don't really know the technical words in their original language.

236
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:03,059
I mean, things like andante and pianissimo, things like this, I think are universal, right?

237
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,639
They're used in whatever language.

238
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,440
Exactly, very widely used.

239
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:15,379
But things like the accidentals or bass clef or scales and stuff like that, I think it's obviously different languages.

240
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,440
For example, you know Italian, like scales or accidentals, do you use it?

241
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:20,740
They're different.

242
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,080
They're different, right?

243
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,200
All of the other words.

244
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:33,759
So the instructions on the page, because music is shared all over the world, the instructions on the page are almost always in Italian, so piano, andante, or they're in German music.

245
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:39,179
But everything else, scales, octaves, these are all in your native language.

246
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,299
And so they're very, very important to study if you want to play and I think very, very useful if you want to study an instrument.

247
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,019
Yeah, of course.

248
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:59,000
I think it's also a very good idea to just have a general knowledge about these things because sometimes it's nice to know a little bit about it and maybe if a friend is talking about music, you can maybe understand a little bit more about what it's like.

249
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:05,519
Or if you see music, a sheet of music, you can now more or less know what's going on with all those drawings and little scribbles there.

250
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:11,919
And if you have any questions, of course you're welcome to come to our website and ask or share your experiences as Marco has just said.

251
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,120
So please come to EnglishPod.com.

252
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,940
