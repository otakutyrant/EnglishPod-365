EnglishPod.com Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Great!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Good, good.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This week work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the 16th notes.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Now let's take a look at this tricky section.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Charlene, before I start I was wondering if it was okay if I put a small crescendo in here and then a decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hmm, it might work.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll have to hear it.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Show me what you've done.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not bad.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was horrible.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I played it much better at home.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's just nerves.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just play the right hand for now.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ta, ti, triple e, ti.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Good, good.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't forget the accidentals.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The key signature says that note should be a G sharp but now it's a G natural.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now add the bass clef.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're going too fast.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is that better?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, much better.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What was that?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sorry, the stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's okay.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Keep going.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Watch your dynamics.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Keep your elbows lifted.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Remember to stroke the keys.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't pound.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's better.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or as more so as your musicianship.
