EnglishPod.com Hi Cody, how did practicing go this week?

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:17,079
Well, I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn't get a chance to memorize the second page, but I think I mastered the tricky section.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:17,579
Great!

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,679
Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first.

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,980
Good, good.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,940
This week work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the 16th notes.

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,439
Now let's take a look at this tricky section.

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:43,619
Charlene, before I start I was wondering if it was okay if I put a small crescendo in here and then a decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,380
Hmm, it might work.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,880
I'll have to hear it.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,979
Show me what you've done.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,820
Not bad.

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,200
It was horrible.

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,299
I played it much better at home.

15
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,780
It's just nerves.

16
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,359
Just play the right hand for now.

17
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,099
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ta, ti, triple e, ti.

18
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,060
Good, good.

19
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,359
Don't forget the accidentals.

20
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,819
The key signature says that note should be a G sharp but now it's a G natural.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,079
Now add the bass clef.

22
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,120
You're going too fast.

23
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,180
Remember the tempo for this piece is andante.

24
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,219
Is that better?

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,819
Yes, much better.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal.

27
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,579
What was that?

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,079
Sorry, the stretch for that octave is always hard to make.

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,040
That's okay.

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,739
Keep going.

31
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,040
You're moving ahead by leaps and bounds.

32
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,939
Watch your dynamics.

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,980
Keep your elbows lifted.

34
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,459
Remember to stroke the keys.

35
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,359
Don't pound.

36
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,799
That's better.

37
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:08,879
Remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or as more so as your musicianship.
