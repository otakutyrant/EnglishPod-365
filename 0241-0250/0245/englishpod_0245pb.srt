1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,740
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,080
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,860
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,400
My name is Katherine.

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:16,100
And today we're talking about something that I haven't actually seen in a long time, but is very common in the States, especially in suburban areas.

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:16,960
That's right.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:21,660
We're going to get a subscription, as the title of the lesson says.

8
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:25,920
So we're going to subscribe to magazines, newspapers, stuff like that.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,199
Right.

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,200
So there's a guy coming around to everyone's houses and he's offering different magazine subscriptions.

11
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,119
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,500
Good afternoon, ma'am.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,759
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

14
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:47,799
No, thank you.

15
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:48,579
I'm not interested.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,479
Please, ma'am.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,159
If you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something that could interest you.

18
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,119
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking.

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,460
So if you'd excuse me.

20
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,920
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,319
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

22
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:04,859
Wow.

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,140
Well, that would be kind of useful.

24
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,459
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,439
Sure do.

26
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,500
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

27
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:17,140
Wow.

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,180
This is nice.

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,239
Okay.

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,060
Sign me up for both publications.

31
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,560
You mentioned you have a dog.

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,819
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops and even pet sitters.

33
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,680
That's exactly what I needed.

34
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,060
What else do you have?

35
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,040
Well, I also have...

36
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,099
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:46,200
So as you saw, Mike is, well, not very excited to be selling subscriptions, but he has magazines about almost everything, I think.

38
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:46,739
That's right.

39
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:52,000
And he's actually a pretty good salesperson because it sounds like this customer is going to buy quite a few magazines.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,659
Exactly.

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,579
And so he used a lot of interesting vocabulary related to magazines and subscriptions.

42
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,299
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:04,959
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,219
Okay.

45
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,759
So this first word is one that we've already said a couple of times in today's lesson.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
This is the topic of the lesson.

47
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,960
The word is subscription.

48
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:13,900
Okay.

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:22,560
So if you get a subscription, that means that you are paying money to receive something every month, every week, et cetera.

50
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,039
That's right.

51
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,939
So the time is fixed.

52
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,599
Like you said, it could be weekly.

53
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:27,979
The time could change.

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:34,939
But basically, you have a promise that after you pay this money, you will receive something periodically.

55
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,419
Right.

56
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,240
And so there are many things that you could have a subscription for, not just magazines.

57
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,180
Newspapers come in subscriptions.

58
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:42,900
That's right.

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,039
Or maybe you pay for satellite TV.

60
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,099
That's a subscription.

61
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,759
So you pay every month and you receive channels, like lots of channels.

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,300
Exactly.

63
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:56,560
Or hopefully EnglishPod, you receive by subscription or you pay the subscription fee.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,240
Exactly.

65
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,840
So with EnglishPod, you subscribe.

66
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,280
That would be the verb.

67
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,800
A subscription is the noun.

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:14,460
You subscribe to a service like a newspaper magazine and you receive the magazine or the service every month, every week, every day, depending on what the subscription is like.

69
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,419
Okay.

70
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:28,120
And so because subscriptions come at different time frames, so for example, EnglishPod, we have lessons three times a week, newspapers are often times every day, they come in different periods of time.

71
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,360
So we call these kinds of publications periodicals.

72
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,219
Okay.

73
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,500
So for example, as you said, a newspaper, it comes every day.

74
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,960
That's the period of time.

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,180
So it's a periodical, the same as a magazine.

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,099
Sometimes they are weekly, sometimes they are monthly.

77
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,979
Is a book a periodical?

78
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,460
Pop quiz.

79
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:47,099
Okay.

80
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,659
No, because you only get it once.

81
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:58,919
So basically a periodical has to be something I guess that is, that comes out every so often, a new version, a new edition, right?

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,800
It's continually updating.

83
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,580
Okay.

84
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,199
So that is periodicals and subscriptions.

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,539
Now moving on to when he was trying to sell the magazines, he said, we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

86
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,780
So what is a variety?

87
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,519
Variety is a great word.

88
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,259
It's a word I personally am a very big fan of.

89
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,579
I like to have many choices to choose from.

90
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,120
So variety means something that has many options.

91
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:30,439
For example, at the grocery store, there is a great variety of food.

92
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,920
There are apples and crackers and cakes and wine.

93
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,040
So variety means there are many different kinds of something.

94
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,420
Okay.

95
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,339
So many choices.

96
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,980
So if you go to a bookstore, you can have, you can find a variety of books and magazines, for example.

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:44,920
All right.

98
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:57,100
Now moving on to, again, when we're talking about the period of time, how often she's going to get this cooking magazine, the one that he's showing her is a bimonthly publication.

99
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,579
So what exactly does it mean if she receives a magazine bimonthly?

100
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:03,279
Okay.

101
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,339
So this is a bit confusing in English.

102
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,079
Bimonthly has two meanings.

103
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:12,040
But what's important is the word by here or the prefix by.

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,519
That means two.

105
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,560
Okay.

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,500
So we could say bimonthly, biweekly, biannually.

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,060
These all mean two.

108
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:25,279
So in this case, we're talking about something that I receive two times every month.

109
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:25,839
Okay.

110
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,319
Or it can be that you get it once every two months.

111
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,139
Okay.

112
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,100
So that might be confusing.

113
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:33,500
Right.

114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,379
In the first case, let's just say that it's the month of October, and I have this great subscription to a magazine.

115
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:43,279
So in October, I will receive it two times.

116
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,420
So you get it twice.

117
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:55,980
Or it could also mean that you receive the magazine in October, and then you don't receive another magazine until December.

118
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,300
So it's a bimonthly publication.

119
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,879
Every other month.

120
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:00,800
Every two months.

121
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,199
Right.

122
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,279
All right.

123
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,680
So this is very confusing for us.

124
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,100
It's probably confusing for you.

125
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:11,160
But if you see this word bimonthly or biweekly, you should ask the person who's offering the subscription what kind they mean.

126
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:14,800
Is it every month two times, or is it every other month?

127
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

128
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:16,899
So exactly.

129
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,800
Just remember the prefix by means two.

130
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:30,519
And then if it's bimonthly, biannual, biweekly, you have to more or less make sure that they specify what they mean, because they can mean both, and that's how ambiguous this word is.

131
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,019
It is.

132
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,959
But the next word we have for you is not nearly as confusing.

133
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:43,060
It's a very, very common word in both periodicals and sales, but also in marketing and business as well.

134
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:43,620
Right.

135
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,300
We're talking about a quarterly publication, or something that comes out once every quarter.

136
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:50,920
Right.

137
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,459
So if you think about a year, a year has 12 months.

138
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,459
A quarter of a year is three months.

139
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,360
So the first quarter is January, February, March.

140
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,100
Exactly.

141
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,480
So a quarterly publication means that you will get a magazine four times in one year.

142
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,120
Okay.

143
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,199
We could also talk about quarterly sales.

144
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,360
You know, this quarter our business did very well, but last quarter was not so good.

145
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,699
So quarter means three months at a time.

146
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:14,439
Exactly.

147
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,560
And for our last word on language takeaway today, we are talking about a weekly newsletter.

148
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,560
So weekly is pretty straightforward.

149
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:23,899
You receive it once every week.

150
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,500
That's right.

151
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,240
So weekly publications are very common.

152
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,699
What is a newsletter?

153
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,439
A newsletter is important in periodicals because it's not a magazine, but it's not a letter either.

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:47,779
It's basically short update, a couple of pages maybe, or even one page that's on a piece of paper that gives you information about a group or a club or a community.

155
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,779
For example, we could say the EnglishPod newsletter comes out quarterly.

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,720
Exactly.

157
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Maybe in your offices you receive your company's newsletter.

158
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:14,120
So usually they will, some companies will come out with a monthly or a quarterly newsletter where if you have many offices or many branches all over the country or the world, then you will receive updates or news about what's going on in other places within your same company.

159
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:14,839
That's right.

160
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,399
So these are very useful for communication across the company.

161
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:26,720
You can tell some people in your New York office that in Los Angeles we have a new cafeteria or a new employee.

162
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,759
Exactly.

163
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,660
So that is what a newsletter is basically for.

164
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:40,519
I think it's time now for us to listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk to you with four key phrases on Fluency Builder right after this.

165
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,240
No, thank you.

166
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,059
I'm not interested.

167
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:55,679
Please, ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something that could interest you.

168
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,139
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking, so if you'd excuse me.

169
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,860
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

170
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,320
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

171
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,539
Wow.

172
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,820
Well, that would be kind of useful.

173
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,120
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

174
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,200
Sure do.

175
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,279
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

176
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,080
Wow, this is nice.

177
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,960
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,580
You mentioned you have a dog.

179
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,899
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.

180
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,940
That's exactly what I needed.

181
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:35,340
What else do you have?

182
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,280
Well, I also have...

183
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,679
All right, so now we have some sentences or ways that you can say things on Fluency Builder.

184
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:49,179
Fluency Builder.

185
00:09:49,840 --> 00:10:00,320
Okay, this first phrase is very, very common among sales and salespeople because basically it's a way to be polite and to ask someone to listen to you for a little while.

186
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:05,220
The salesperson says, if you could spare five minutes of your time.

187
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,080
Okay, so let's start with that part.

188
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,259
If you could spare.

189
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,940
So to spare something means do you have something extra?

190
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,960
Do you have enough of it?

191
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,299
Yeah, so I could say, can you spare five dollars?

192
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,860
I forgot my wallet at home.

193
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,399
So that means do you have an extra five dollars I could borrow?

194
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,659
Okay, very good.

195
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:33,200
So if you're asking someone to spare five minutes of their time, you're asking them to give you five minutes of their time.

196
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,960
That's right.

197
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,240
So if you could spare a second or if you could spare five minutes of your time, I would like to talk to you.

198
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,539
Okay, so it's a very polite way to ask someone for their time.

199
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,100
Now, for our next phrase, the woman is also very polite.

200
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,879
She says, you know what?

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,940
I have to walk the dog.

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,039
I have to finish cooking.

203
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,259
So if you would excuse me.

204
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,279
She's basically saying no in a very polite way.

205
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,879
If you could excuse me, I've got to go.

206
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:06,879
So this is a kind of a very indirect but polite way of saying, I'm sorry, I can't stay.

207
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,480
I've got to go.

208
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,460
Or I can't really talk to you right now.

209
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:10,919
That's right.

210
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:19,120
Even if you're at a party, for example, and you're talking to somebody but you don't really want to talk to them anymore, you could say, it was nice talking to you if you could excuse me.

211
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,159
It means if I can leave now.

212
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,279
Okay, so you can say if you could excuse me or if you would excuse me.

213
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,940
Both forms are pretty much the same.

214
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:35,960
Okay, and what about when she actually is convinced about the magazine, she says, wow, this is nice.

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,100
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

216
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay, sign me up.

217
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,179
This means I would like a subscription.

218
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:47,700
Okay, that means I would like you to take my information and I will give you some money.

219
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,720
But this is also a really nice phrase in English because it means I want to do this.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,899
I'm interested.

221
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:01,179
So if you would use this in another context, for example, a group of friends are going to the movies.

222
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,360
I say, oh, sign me up.

223
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,019
I want to go.

224
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,639
I heard that movie was awesome.

225
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:06,679
Okay, very good.

226
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,120
So sign me up is like include me.

227
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,580
I want to go to or I'm part of it, of whatever you're doing.

228
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,220
Exactly.

229
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,679
Okay, so that's all the phrases we have for you today.

230
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,460
I think they're really good.

231
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,879
They're not specific for this circumstance of getting a subscription.

232
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,480
As we saw, we can use them in many other situations.

233
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:32,299
So I think we should go back, listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

234
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,639
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

235
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,100
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

236
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,879
Wow, well, that would be kind of useful.

237
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,179
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

238
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,159
Sure do.

239
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,220
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

240
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,899
Wow, this is nice.

241
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,779
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

242
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,259
You mentioned you have a dog.

243
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,539
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.

244
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,399
That's exactly what I needed.

245
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,779
What else do you have?

246
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,860
Well, I also have...

247
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,279
All right, so subscriptions, periodicals, all this is very common, as you said, in the United States.

248
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,320
People get them through the mail every month, right?

249
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,539
That's right, and I have to say, it's changing now.

250
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:50,059
We used to get subscriptions at home when I was a kid.

251
00:13:50,059 --> 00:14:03,919
We'd have magazine subscriptions and even a newspaper subscription, but these days, people are doing more and more on the Internet, so you don't see the guy with the subscriptions coming from, you know, going from door to door to sell you this.

252
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,940
You do it yourself on the Internet, so it's pretty common that way.

253
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,820
Do you have any web subscriptions?

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:11,940
No, no, no.

255
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,279
I haven't signed up for any periodicals on the web.

256
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,139
I do receive the newspaper every day, and that's about it.

257
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:27,059
It's kind of hard to receive magazines where we are, but I am a big fan of magazines like National Geographic or Popular Mechanics.

258
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,419
I had that when I was a kid.

259
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:32,139
My grandmother would always give us a subscription to National Geographic for Christmas.

260
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:41,519
It's a very good magazine, and it's so colorful, full of pictures and really interesting articles, not only about animals, but about the world in general, so it's really cool.

261
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,919
That's right, and they always give you a map that you could take out and open up, and it was the best part of the whole magazine.

262
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,559
Exactly.

263
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:54,240
So, actually, I really enjoy having subscriptions to periodicals, magazines, newspapers.

264
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm not a big fan of newsletters or things on the Internet.

265
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,799
I kind of like to hold a magazine or take it with me if I'm on a trip.

266
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,039
Yeah, I totally agree.

267
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:14,019
So, yeah, but I think many of our listeners may have a subscription to their local newspaper, local magazines, or maybe, as you said, Internet subscriptions.

268
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:22,220
I know some people sign up for the Harvard Business Review that's available online, or even I think the New York Times has an online platform.

269
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,259
They do, they do.

270
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,700
So, you should let us know what subscriptions do you have, what periodicals do you like to read.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,120
Our website, of course, is EnglishPod.com.

272
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,120
You can also purchase a subscription there.

273
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,000
We hope to see you on the website, and until next time.

274
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:35,620
All right, bye.
