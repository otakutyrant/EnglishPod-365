1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Katherine.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we're talking about something that I haven't actually seen in a long time, but is very common in the States, especially in suburban areas.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to get a subscription, as the title of the lesson says.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're going to subscribe to magazines, newspapers, stuff like that.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So there's a guy coming around to everyone's houses and he's offering different magazine subscriptions.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Good afternoon, ma'am.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, thank you.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not interested.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Please, ma'am.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something that could interest you.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So if you'd excuse me.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Wow.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, that would be kind of useful.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sure do.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wow.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is nice.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sign me up for both publications.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You mentioned you have a dog.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops and even pet sitters.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's exactly what I needed.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What else do you have?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, I also have...

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All right, we're back.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So as you saw, Mike is, well, not very excited to be selling subscriptions, but he has magazines about almost everything, I think.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And he's actually a pretty good salesperson because it sounds like this customer is going to buy quite a few magazines.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Exactly.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And so he used a lot of interesting vocabulary related to magazines and subscriptions.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So this first word is one that we've already said a couple of times in today's lesson.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is the topic of the lesson.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The word is subscription.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So if you get a subscription, that means that you are paying money to receive something every month, every week, et cetera.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the time is fixed.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Like you said, it could be weekly.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The time could change.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But basically, you have a promise that after you pay this money, you will receive something periodically.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Right.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And so there are many things that you could have a subscription for, not just magazines.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Newspapers come in subscriptions.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or maybe you pay for satellite TV.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's a subscription.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So you pay every month and you receive channels, like lots of channels.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Exactly.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or hopefully EnglishPod, you receive by subscription or you pay the subscription fee.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Exactly.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So with EnglishPod, you subscribe.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That would be the verb.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A subscription is the noun.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You subscribe to a service like a newspaper magazine and you receive the magazine or the service every month, every week, every day, depending on what the subscription is like.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And so because subscriptions come at different time frames, so for example, EnglishPod, we have lessons three times a week, newspapers are often times every day, they come in different periods of time.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So we call these kinds of publications periodicals.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So for example, as you said, a newspaper, it comes every day.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's the period of time.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So it's a periodical, the same as a magazine.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sometimes they are weekly, sometimes they are monthly.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Is a book a periodical?

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Pop quiz.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, because you only get it once.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So basically a periodical has to be something I guess that is, that comes out every so often, a new version, a new edition, right?

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's continually updating.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So that is periodicals and subscriptions.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now moving on to when he was trying to sell the magazines, he said, we have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So what is a variety?

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Variety is a great word.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a word I personally am a very big fan of.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I like to have many choices to choose from.

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So variety means something that has many options.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
For example, at the grocery store, there is a great variety of food.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There are apples and crackers and cakes and wine.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So variety means there are many different kinds of something.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Okay.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So many choices.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So if you go to a bookstore, you can have, you can find a variety of books and magazines, for example.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All right.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now moving on to, again, when we're talking about the period of time, how often she's going to get this cooking magazine, the one that he's showing her is a bimonthly publication.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So what exactly does it mean if she receives a magazine bimonthly?

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So this is a bit confusing in English.

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Bimonthly has two meanings.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But what's important is the word by here or the prefix by.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That means two.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So we could say bimonthly, biweekly, biannually.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
These all mean two.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So in this case, we're talking about something that I receive two times every month.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Or it can be that you get it once every two months.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So that might be confusing.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In the first case, let's just say that it's the month of October, and I have this great subscription to a magazine.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So in October, I will receive it two times.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So you get it twice.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Or it could also mean that you receive the magazine in October, and then you don't receive another magazine until December.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So it's a bimonthly publication.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Every other month.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Every two months.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Right.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All right.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So this is very confusing for us.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's probably confusing for you.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But if you see this word bimonthly or biweekly, you should ask the person who's offering the subscription what kind they mean.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is it every month two times, or is it every other month?

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So exactly.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just remember the prefix by means two.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And then if it's bimonthly, biannual, biweekly, you have to more or less make sure that they specify what they mean, because they can mean both, and that's how ambiguous this word is.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It is.

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But the next word we have for you is not nearly as confusing.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a very, very common word in both periodicals and sales, but also in marketing and business as well.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
We're talking about a quarterly publication, or something that comes out once every quarter.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So if you think about a year, a year has 12 months.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A quarter of a year is three months.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So the first quarter is January, February, March.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Exactly.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So a quarterly publication means that you will get a magazine four times in one year.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We could also talk about quarterly sales.

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know, this quarter our business did very well, but last quarter was not so good.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So quarter means three months at a time.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Exactly.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And for our last word on language takeaway today, we are talking about a weekly newsletter.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So weekly is pretty straightforward.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You receive it once every week.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So weekly publications are very common.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is a newsletter?

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
A newsletter is important in periodicals because it's not a magazine, but it's not a letter either.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's basically short update, a couple of pages maybe, or even one page that's on a piece of paper that gives you information about a group or a club or a community.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
For example, we could say the EnglishPod newsletter comes out quarterly.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Exactly.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Maybe in your offices you receive your company's newsletter.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So usually they will, some companies will come out with a monthly or a quarterly newsletter where if you have many offices or many branches all over the country or the world, then you will receive updates or news about what's going on in other places within your same company.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's right.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So these are very useful for communication across the company.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can tell some people in your New York office that in Los Angeles we have a new cafeteria or a new employee.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Exactly.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So that is what a newsletter is basically for.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think it's time now for us to listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk to you with four key phrases on Fluency Builder right after this.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No, thank you.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm not interested.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Please, ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something that could interest you.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking, so if you'd excuse me.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wow.

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, that would be kind of useful.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sure do.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wow, this is nice.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You mentioned you have a dog.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's exactly what I needed.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What else do you have?

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, I also have...

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All right, so now we have some sentences or ways that you can say things on Fluency Builder.

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Fluency Builder.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, this first phrase is very, very common among sales and salespeople because basically it's a way to be polite and to ask someone to listen to you for a little while.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The salesperson says, if you could spare five minutes of your time.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, so let's start with that part.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If you could spare.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So to spare something means do you have something extra?

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you have enough of it?

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, so I could say, can you spare five dollars?

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I forgot my wallet at home.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So that means do you have an extra five dollars I could borrow?

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay, very good.

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So if you're asking someone to spare five minutes of their time, you're asking them to give you five minutes of their time.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's right.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So if you could spare a second or if you could spare five minutes of your time, I would like to talk to you.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay, so it's a very polite way to ask someone for their time.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Now, for our next phrase, the woman is also very polite.

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
She says, you know what?

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I have to walk the dog.

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have to finish cooking.

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So if you would excuse me.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
She's basically saying no in a very polite way.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you could excuse me, I've got to go.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So this is a kind of a very indirect but polite way of saying, I'm sorry, I can't stay.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I've got to go.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Or I can't really talk to you right now.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's right.

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Even if you're at a party, for example, and you're talking to somebody but you don't really want to talk to them anymore, you could say, it was nice talking to you if you could excuse me.

211
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It means if I can leave now.

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, so you can say if you could excuse me or if you would excuse me.

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Both forms are pretty much the same.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay, and what about when she actually is convinced about the magazine, she says, wow, this is nice.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, sign me up.

217
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This means I would like a subscription.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, that means I would like you to take my information and I will give you some money.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But this is also a really nice phrase in English because it means I want to do this.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm interested.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if you would use this in another context, for example, a group of friends are going to the movies.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I say, oh, sign me up.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I want to go.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I heard that movie was awesome.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay, very good.

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So sign me up is like include me.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I want to go to or I'm part of it, of whatever you're doing.

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Exactly.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay, so that's all the phrases we have for you today.

230
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think they're really good.

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
They're not specific for this circumstance of getting a subscription.

232
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
As we saw, we can use them in many other situations.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So I think we should go back, listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

235
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Wow, well, that would be kind of useful.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Sure do.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

240
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wow, this is nice.

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You mentioned you have a dog.

243
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's exactly what I needed.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What else do you have?

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, I also have...

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
All right, so subscriptions, periodicals, all this is very common, as you said, in the United States.

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
People get them through the mail every month, right?

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's right, and I have to say, it's changing now.

250
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We used to get subscriptions at home when I was a kid.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We'd have magazine subscriptions and even a newspaper subscription, but these days, people are doing more and more on the Internet, so you don't see the guy with the subscriptions coming from, you know, going from door to door to sell you this.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You do it yourself on the Internet, so it's pretty common that way.

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you have any web subscriptions?

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, no, no.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I haven't signed up for any periodicals on the web.

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I do receive the newspaper every day, and that's about it.

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's kind of hard to receive magazines where we are, but I am a big fan of magazines like National Geographic or Popular Mechanics.

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I had that when I was a kid.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
My grandmother would always give us a subscription to National Geographic for Christmas.

260
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a very good magazine, and it's so colorful, full of pictures and really interesting articles, not only about animals, but about the world in general, so it's really cool.

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's right, and they always give you a map that you could take out and open up, and it was the best part of the whole magazine.

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Exactly.

263
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So, actually, I really enjoy having subscriptions to periodicals, magazines, newspapers.

264
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm not a big fan of newsletters or things on the Internet.

265
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I kind of like to hold a magazine or take it with me if I'm on a trip.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, I totally agree.

267
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So, yeah, but I think many of our listeners may have a subscription to their local newspaper, local magazines, or maybe, as you said, Internet subscriptions.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know some people sign up for the Harvard Business Review that's available online, or even I think the New York Times has an online platform.

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They do, they do.

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So, you should let us know what subscriptions do you have, what periodicals do you like to read.

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Our website, of course, is EnglishPod.com.

272
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can also purchase a subscription there.

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We hope to see you on the website, and until next time.

274
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,000
All right, bye.
