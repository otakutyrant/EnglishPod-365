00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good afternoon, ma'am.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No, thank you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm not interested.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please, ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something that could interest you.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking, so if you'd excuse me.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Wow, well, that would be kind of useful.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sure do.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Wow, this is nice.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You mentioned you have a dog.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's exactly what I needed.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What else do you have?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, I also have...

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thank you.
