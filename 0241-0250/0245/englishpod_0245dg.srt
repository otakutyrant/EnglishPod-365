Good afternoon, ma'am.

2
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,759
My name is Mike and I'm selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:10,820
No, thank you.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm not interested.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,160
Please, ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I'm sure we could find something that could interest you.

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,440
I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking, so if you'd excuse me.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,940
We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking.

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:27,320
This one, for example, is a bimonthly publication with recipes from all over the world.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,160
Wow, well, that would be kind of useful.

10
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,460
Do you have any other cooking magazines?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,460
Sure do.

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,500
This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas.

13
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,159
Wow, this is nice.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,060
Okay, sign me up for both publications.

15
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,539
You mentioned you have a dog.

16
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,820
Most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops, and even pet sitters.

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,679
That's exactly what I needed.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,060
What else do you have?

19
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,200
Well, I also have...

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,980
Thank you.
