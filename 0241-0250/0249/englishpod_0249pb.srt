00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,039
My name is Katherine, and today we've got a monologue.

4
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:13,619
We've got one person talking, telling you how to make the perfect sandwich.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,439
That's right.

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,600
She's a chef, and she's going to teach us.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,120
She's going to talk about all the ingredients and some tips on how to make a sandwich.

8
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:23,620
So be prepared.

9
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,739
This is going to be a really good lesson.

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,280
And I'm already hungry thinking about it, so let's listen to the dialogue.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,760
We'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,140
Welcome to our show.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,119
Today, I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,159
Are you ready?

15
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,500
Let's get started.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,200
Let's start with the basics, bread.

17
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,759
Bread is an important ingredient here.

18
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,679
You need to remember one thing.

19
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,140
Choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb, and color.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:09,700
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,459
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:22,920
Of course, each person's palette is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

23
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:27,319
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,680
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,420
The best choices here are evident.

26
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:42,879
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,420
You can't go wrong with them.

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,219
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,400
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:08,639
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,919
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

32
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,060
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,280
Till next time!

34
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:34,860
All right, we're back, so obviously I think she knows what she's talking about.

35
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,360
This is going to be a great sandwich.

36
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,659
All right, so she mentioned a lot of ingredients, a couple of different words that we might not understand.

37
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,719
So let's take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

38
00:02:52,580 --> 00:03:05,919
Okay, at the beginning of this monologue, as I said, the chef is talking about things that you need to look for in a bread, because bread is the base of a sandwich, and she mentioned the word crumb.

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,439
Okay, yeah, she said freshness, crumb, and color.

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,740
So what does she mean by crumb of the bread?

41
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:22,659
Okay, so crumb, a crumb, is a very, very, very, very, very small piece of bread, like when you put bread in a toaster, maybe it's what falls down, actually.

42
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:25,419
We call them breadcrumbs sometimes.

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,699
You can cook with them, but they're basically little pieces of bread that fall off, little grains.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,539
Okay, yeah, so usually it happens all the time.

45
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:41,699
You're having cookies or you're having some bread, you bite into it, and little pieces of bread or cookie fall down, those are called crumbs.

46
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:52,780
That's right, and I want to remind everyone that the word crumb has a B on the end, C-R-U-M-B, but we don't pronounce the B, we just say crumb.

47
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,120
Yeah, you don't say crumb.

48
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,639
No.

49
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,099
Okay, so just crumb.

50
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,199
Yeah, be careful with that one.

51
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:05,879
All right, so we have to keep a lookout for the crumb of the bread, I guess how fresh and how sometimes when you squeeze bread it makes a nice little sound.

52
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,199
Crunch, crunch.

53
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:07,979
Exactly.

54
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:15,699
So, but she's also recommending a couple of different ingredients, and she said, well, it depends on each person's palate.

55
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,040
So after we've chosen our bread, she talks about a closed sandwich and maybe toasting it.

56
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,240
Okay, so there are two options for sandwiches.

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,160
You might see these on menus as well as when you're cooking yourself.

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,500
A closed sandwich means you have two pieces of bread, one on the bottom and one on top.

59
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,480
It's closed.

60
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,040
Okay.

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,279
But the opposite is an open sandwich.

62
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,079
That means you only have one piece of bread and then maybe you have some meat on top.

63
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:42,740
Oh, okay.

64
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,180
Actually, I always thought that for it to be a sandwich you had to have two pieces of bread.

65
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:55,399
Well, now when you, I would challenge you to look on Google for open-faced sandwich or open sandwich, you'll find some very interesting things.

66
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,060
Yeah, I've had them.

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
Actually, you can put some meat and some cheese just on top of a piece of bread and you're done.

68
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,560
I'm a huge fan of those, yeah.

69
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:05,319
So that's a closed sandwich, though, when you have two pieces of bread and the meat in the middle.

70
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:12,339
And after that, she talks a little bit about people's tastes and what people want, but she used a very special word.

71
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:13,040
That's right.

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,579
She said each person's palate is different.

73
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:25,019
Okay, a palate in the context of food and taste means the way that food flavors affect a person individually.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,980
That's right.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:37,079
So sometimes you say that some people have a very good palate, so they can maybe tell the difference between a wine from 1978 and a wine from 1980 or something like that.

76
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,360
That's right.

77
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,819
So you can have a palate, a good palate for wine, but also in this case, we're talking about food.

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:48,860
I could say I have a very sensitive palate, so I don't like to use very, very strong flavors.

79
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,540
Okay.

80
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,920
So the palate is basically your taste.

81
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,879
It's actually a physical part of your mouth.

82
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,800
It's the top of your mouth where your tongue can touch the top of your mouth.

83
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,160
The roof of your mouth, exactly.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,360
And it's not just your ability to taste sweet, it's sweet and salty and sour and all these different flavors.

85
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:07,920
Okay.

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,540
So a person's palate.

87
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,600
Now herbs, right?

88
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,339
Now moving on to the main ingredients.

89
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:25,920
She mentioned a lot of easy ones like tomatoes, onions, lettuce, but then we got into a little bit more specific things like, for example, this word that's always mispronounced, herbs.

90
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,300
Actually, you can say herbs.

91
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,040
It's a very British thing to do though.

92
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,319
So Americans and Canadians say herbs.

93
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
It has an H in the front.

94
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,560
That's why it's confusing.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,100
Okay.

96
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:45,680
So we can accept basically if somebody says herbs, but I guess in American English, it's more commonly pronounced as a silent H.

97
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,040
That's right.

98
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:46,740
Herbs.

99
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:47,319
Herbs.

100
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,519
And what are herbs?

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,399
You might be asking.

102
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,040
Well, herbs can come in many different shapes and sizes.

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,339
They're usually green.

104
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,120
They're usually grown.

105
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:59,199
They're ways of giving food different flavors.

106
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:01,899
And so basil, for example, is an herb.

107
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:05,660
It's a big green leaf, something that we use in pesto, for example.

108
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,579
You can also have rosemary or mint.

109
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,379
These are all kinds of herbs.

110
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,839
Some people even have an herb garden.

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,480
That's right.

112
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,740
They grow their own herbs.

113
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,019
So now moving on to these weird looking vegetables, for example, aubergines.

114
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:23,839
Okay.

115
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,839
Aubergines are the same as eggplants.

116
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,779
So you might hear this word sometimes.

117
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,420
It's basically a big purple vegetable.

118
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:30,980
Okay.

119
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,839
So for those of you who haven't seen an aubergine or an eggplant, yeah, it's a big purple vegetable.

120
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,100
They kind of looks like a cucumber, but a little bit fatter.

121
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,040
Very fat.

122
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,060
And if you hold them, they're not very hard.

123
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,920
They're kind of soft.

124
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,379
Yeah.

125
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:55,000
And a lot of people like to grill these or to cook with them in, for example, Chinese where there's a lot of eggplant or aubergines.

126
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:55,779
All right.

127
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,439
So we've had those.

128
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,300
We have mushrooms.

129
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,920
And what about asparagus?

130
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,660
Asparagus is actually one of my favorite foods, but it's very strange looking.

131
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,959
It's kind of green and it kind of has this little head, right?

132
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,680
That's right.

133
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,519
It's long.

134
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:12,399
It's green.

135
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,779
It's kind of like a pencil, but at the very top, it's kind of like a plant almost.

136
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,220
Yeah.

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,600
They have a very strong taste and many people don't like asparagus.

138
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:24,319
That's right.

139
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,420
And the Germans, I think, actually Germans and the Dutch have special asparagus that's white.

140
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,100
Oh, really?

141
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:30,959
It's called Spargel.

142
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:31,660
Oh, wow.

143
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:37,960
But if any of you know what that is, it's basically a white asparagus, but asparagus is very popular in a lot of parts of the world.

144
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,539
Okay.

145
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:45,399
So now we have our vegetables, we have our bread, but now we need to add a little bit of extra flavor to the sandwich.

146
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,059
So this is where we add some condiments.

147
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:48,740
Okay.

148
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,220
So condiments are a category.

149
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,539
You can have many different kinds of condiments.

150
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,559
The most common are salt and pepper.

151
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:05,320
So a condiment is a category of the things that you would add flavor to, as you said, salt, pepper, but here they mention, for example, mayonnaise or ketchup.

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Ooh, and mustard as well.

153
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,059
These are all condiments.

154
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,200
So in different parts of the world, they have different kinds of condiments.

155
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:15,399
I've seen, for example, a lot of vinegar in Asia.

156
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,019
You can also have hot pepper flakes like in Europe.

157
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:18,820
Yeah.

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,379
The condiments that you add to your sandwich are varied.

159
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,879
I've seen people put all types of condiments in their sandwich.

160
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:33,779
And for example, one that may be a little bit strange or maybe a little bit more expensive condiment is caviar.

161
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,100
So caviar is not always considered a condiment.

162
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,919
It can be, but it can also be eaten alone, but it's basically just fish eggs.

163
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,320
They're little fish eggs.

164
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:43,000
Very small.

165
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:49,259
It always usually, in people's mind, it's kind of like a fancy food, very luxurious, very expensive.

166
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,279
Well, it can be very expensive if you get like beluga caviar.

167
00:09:53,179 --> 00:10:01,600
A lot of caviar comes from the Caucasus and Russia and Ukraine, these places, and it's very salty in flavor.

168
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,519
That's right.

169
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,740
So that is also considered a condiment in our case because we're using it for a sandwich, right?

170
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:12,559
Okay, so a lot of words there, a lot of interesting things going on in our sandwich.

171
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,759
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder, where we're going to take a look at some phrases.

172
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:20,779
Fluency Builder.

173
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:28,919
All right, so let's go back to the very beginning of the dialogue when she said, all right, let's start with the basics.

174
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, the basics is a set phrase in this context.

175
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,980
We can say this about many different things, but the basics basically refers to the most simple ingredients or the most simple elements.

176
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,360
In this case, bread, bread or meat, but you can also talk about the basics in other contexts.

177
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,539
Like clothes shopping.

178
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,259
When school started when I was a kid, my mom always used to buy me the basics, so t-shirts and socks.

179
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,240
So I guess the basics are the absolute necessary things, right?

180
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
And also very simple.

181
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:11,759
So for example, if you talk about dancing, the basics would be maybe a certain sequence of steps that important, essential, right?

182
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,139
That's right.

183
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,379
And would caviar be a part of the basics, for example?

184
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,440
No, no, no.

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,960
No, that's an extra.

186
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,559
Okay.

187
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,820
So this is what we refer to when we say the basics.

188
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:29,559
Now our chef, when she continued talking about her sandwich, she said, I would strongly recommend you use fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

189
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:30,320
Okay.

190
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:38,980
So you can say I would recommend this, but to strongly recommend is to have a very, very strong feeling about something.

191
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,419
That's right.

192
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,220
You're saying to the person, basically do it.

193
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:42,860
You must.

194
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,600
Yeah.

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,059
So if maybe your friend is sick, you can say something like, I would strongly recommend you go to the doctor today.

196
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,940
That means you really, really should go to the doctor.

197
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:55,639
I would be upset if you didn't.

198
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:57,159
It's kind of formal though.

199
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:07,580
It seems like you would maybe use it with your boss or maybe with a person you don't really know that well, but with your friend, you would say, I really think you should go to the doctor.

200
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,679
But you can say it in both contexts, but yeah, definitely more of a formal thing.

201
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,139
Okay.

202
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,179
So we strongly recommend it that you know.

203
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,519
Okay.

204
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,320
All right.

205
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
So now for our last phrase, right?

206
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,740
Where are we?

207
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,860
Last but not least.

208
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:23,500
All right.

209
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,799
Now moving on to our next phrase.

210
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,679
When she started talking about the condiment, she said, last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments.

211
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:33,460
Okay.

212
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,299
This is a very, very common phrase.

213
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:36,100
It's a set phrase.

214
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,200
You will hear these words together very often.

215
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,799
Last but not least.

216
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:42,659
What could this possibly mean?

217
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,659
So obviously last means the last step here.

218
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:46,679
The last point.

219
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:47,600
But why not least?

220
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,559
Well, it's not least important.

221
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,620
Just because it's last, it doesn't mean that it's not important.

222
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:53,500
Okay.

223
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:01,740
So maybe there are many people who have to give presentations in school and I'm the very, very last person to go.

224
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,019
The teacher will say last but not least, Catherine.

225
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,720
That's right.

226
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,779
Makes me feel better because you're saying you're last, but it doesn't mean you're not important.

227
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:10,360
Exactly.

228
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:23,120
So when you want to make sure that the last point of your presentation or what you're talking about is not ignored or you want to make sure that everyone knows that it's also very important, you say last but not least.

229
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:23,620
Great.

230
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,440
All right.

231
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:27,899
And now last but not least, the end of Fluency Builder.

232
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,080
We're going to close off with this little phrase.

233
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,740
When she was talking about salt and pepper, she said a touch of salt and pepper.

234
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,659
Okay.

235
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,200
A touch of salt and pepper is basically a measure.

236
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:39,980
It's not a lot.

237
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,980
It's very little amount of salt and pepper.

238
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,440
So we can say a touch.

239
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,639
So it's not really a specific quantity though, right?

240
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,440
We're not saying like a spoon of salt and pepper.

241
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:49,960
Not at all.

242
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,600
It basically means a little bit.

243
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,320
A little bit.

244
00:13:52,539 --> 00:14:05,320
So you're just saying maybe you'll hear this in maybe a cooking show or you'll read it in books when they'll say a pinch of salt or a touch of salt or a dash of salt.

245
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,200
That's right.

246
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,860
You could even say it about other things.

247
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:17,860
For example, if my friend just wrote this article and he wanted me to read it, I'd say it's a really good article but it could use a touch of humor.

248
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:18,399
Okay.

249
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,159
I think maybe if you made it a little bit funny, it would be better.

250
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,840
Or maybe if you're painting your house, you can say, oh, I think a touch of red paint would look really nice on this wall.

251
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,200
That's right.

252
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,659
A little bit of red paint would be good.

253
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,200
Okay.

254
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,759
So a touch of.

255
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,039
A really, really good phrase.

256
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,039
It makes you sound very natural.

257
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,100
Okay.

258
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,360
So that's all the time we have for today.

259
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,120
But before we go, let's listen to the dialogue again.

260
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,559
Welcome to our show.

261
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,559
Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

262
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,580
Are you ready?

263
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,899
Let's get started.

264
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:00,899
Let's start with the basics.

265
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:01,620
Bread.

266
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,159
Bread is an important ingredient here.

267
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,059
You need to remember one thing.

268
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:11,539
Choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb, and color.

269
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:21,100
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

270
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:24,879
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

271
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:34,340
Of course, each person's palette is different but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

272
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:38,720
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

273
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,139
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

274
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,840
The best choices here are evident.

275
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,299
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

276
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,879
You can't go wrong with them.

277
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:03,600
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

278
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,840
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

279
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:20,039
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

280
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:28,340
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

281
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,460
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

282
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,700
Till next time!

283
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,500
Alright, so talking about sandwich, this really reminds me of making sandwiches at home.

284
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,799
Grilled cheese sandwich.

285
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,659
We didn't really talk about it here, but I think it's my favorite sandwich.

286
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:57,019
The grilled cheese sandwich.

287
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,279
Very easy to make, just two pieces of bread and cheese inside.

288
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,100
Do you use butter though?

289
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:02,639
Yes.

290
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,660
Yeah, so you have to butter the bread, and so when you grill it, it gets really nice and brown.

291
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,079
Yeah.

292
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,700
Actually, I'm not a very big sandwich fan when I'm having, for example, a meal like lunch.

293
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,339
I don't really, I don't know, I think I need something more solid than just a sandwich at times.

294
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:20,160
Interesting.

295
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,579
I had a sandwich for dinner last night.

296
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,619
Not that we speak about it, yeah.

297
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,380
I had an egg salad sandwich.

298
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,119
So you had egg salad inside two pieces of bread.

299
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,259
That's right, but the bread I had was French bread, so that long, thin bread was very crunchy, very delicious.

300
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,819
But I actually, I like sandwiches for dinner.

301
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,660
They are a little bit lighter, yeah.

302
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:53,039
When you're having a big meal, it just seems like, although maybe sometimes places give you very big, heavy sandwiches that have, you know, like ham and salami and just a lot of things in there, so they're very, very filling.

303
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:54,380
That's very true.

304
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,859
Like a meatball sub, for example, is a very heavy sandwich.

305
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:58,500
That's right.

306
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:01,279
But sandwiches come in all shapes and sizes.

307
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:07,900
You can make basically any sandwich that your brain can think of, and so we hope that you've learned some words for talking about sandwiches today.

308
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:14,259
Of course, if you have any questions or comments or you want to share with us your very favorite sandwich, you should do so on EnglishPod.com.

309
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:14,700
All right.

310
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,420
We'll see you guys there.

311
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:15,799
Bye.

312
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:21,859
Bye.
