00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we've got a monologue.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We've got one person talking, telling you how to make the perfect sandwich.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
She's a chef, and she's going to teach us.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
She's going to talk about all the ingredients and some tips on how to make a sandwich.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So be prepared.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is going to be a really good lesson.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I'm already hungry thinking about it, so let's listen to the dialogue.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Welcome to our show.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today, I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you ready?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's get started.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's start with the basics, bread.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bread is an important ingredient here.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You need to remember one thing.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb, and color.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Of course, each person's palette is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The best choices here are evident.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can't go wrong with them.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Till next time!

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, we're back, so obviously I think she knows what she's talking about.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is going to be a great sandwich.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, so she mentioned a lot of ingredients, a couple of different words that we might not understand.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So let's take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, at the beginning of this monologue, as I said, the chef is talking about things that you need to look for in a bread, because bread is the base of a sandwich, and she mentioned the word crumb.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay, yeah, she said freshness, crumb, and color.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So what does she mean by crumb of the bread?

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, so crumb, a crumb, is a very, very, very, very, very small piece of bread, like when you put bread in a toaster, maybe it's what falls down, actually.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We call them breadcrumbs sometimes.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can cook with them, but they're basically little pieces of bread that fall off, little grains.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, yeah, so usually it happens all the time.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're having cookies or you're having some bread, you bite into it, and little pieces of bread or cookie fall down, those are called crumbs.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right, and I want to remind everyone that the word crumb has a B on the end, C-R-U-M-B, but we don't pronounce the B, we just say crumb.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, you don't say crumb.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, so just crumb.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, be careful with that one.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All right, so we have to keep a lookout for the crumb of the bread, I guess how fresh and how sometimes when you squeeze bread it makes a nice little sound.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Crunch, crunch.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Exactly.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, but she's also recommending a couple of different ingredients, and she said, well, it depends on each person's palate.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So after we've chosen our bread, she talks about a closed sandwich and maybe toasting it.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, so there are two options for sandwiches.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You might see these on menus as well as when you're cooking yourself.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
A closed sandwich means you have two pieces of bread, one on the bottom and one on top.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's closed.

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But the opposite is an open sandwich.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That means you only have one piece of bread and then maybe you have some meat on top.

63
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, okay.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Actually, I always thought that for it to be a sandwich you had to have two pieces of bread.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, now when you, I would challenge you to look on Google for open-faced sandwich or open sandwich, you'll find some very interesting things.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, I've had them.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Actually, you can put some meat and some cheese just on top of a piece of bread and you're done.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm a huge fan of those, yeah.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So that's a closed sandwich, though, when you have two pieces of bread and the meat in the middle.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And after that, she talks a little bit about people's tastes and what people want, but she used a very special word.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She said each person's palate is different.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, a palate in the context of food and taste means the way that food flavors affect a person individually.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's right.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So sometimes you say that some people have a very good palate, so they can maybe tell the difference between a wine from 1978 and a wine from 1980 or something like that.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So you can have a palate, a good palate for wine, but also in this case, we're talking about food.

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I could say I have a very sensitive palate, so I don't like to use very, very strong flavors.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So the palate is basically your taste.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's actually a physical part of your mouth.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's the top of your mouth where your tongue can touch the top of your mouth.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The roof of your mouth, exactly.

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And it's not just your ability to taste sweet, it's sweet and salty and sour and all these different flavors.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So a person's palate.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now herbs, right?

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Now moving on to the main ingredients.

89
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
She mentioned a lot of easy ones like tomatoes, onions, lettuce, but then we got into a little bit more specific things like, for example, this word that's always mispronounced, herbs.

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Actually, you can say herbs.

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a very British thing to do though.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So Americans and Canadians say herbs.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It has an H in the front.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's why it's confusing.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So we can accept basically if somebody says herbs, but I guess in American English, it's more commonly pronounced as a silent H.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's right.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Herbs.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Herbs.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And what are herbs?

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You might be asking.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, herbs can come in many different shapes and sizes.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
They're usually green.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They're usually grown.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They're ways of giving food different flavors.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And so basil, for example, is an herb.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a big green leaf, something that we use in pesto, for example.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can also have rosemary or mint.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
These are all kinds of herbs.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Some people even have an herb garden.

111
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's right.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
They grow their own herbs.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So now moving on to these weird looking vegetables, for example, aubergines.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Aubergines are the same as eggplants.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So you might hear this word sometimes.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's basically a big purple vegetable.

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So for those of you who haven't seen an aubergine or an eggplant, yeah, it's a big purple vegetable.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
They kind of looks like a cucumber, but a little bit fatter.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Very fat.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And if you hold them, they're not very hard.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They're kind of soft.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And a lot of people like to grill these or to cook with them in, for example, Chinese where there's a lot of eggplant or aubergines.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
All right.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So we've had those.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We have mushrooms.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And what about asparagus?

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Asparagus is actually one of my favorite foods, but it's very strange looking.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's kind of green and it kind of has this little head, right?

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's right.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's long.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's green.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's kind of like a pencil, but at the very top, it's kind of like a plant almost.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yeah.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They have a very strong taste and many people don't like asparagus.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's right.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And the Germans, I think, actually Germans and the Dutch have special asparagus that's white.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, really?

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's called Spargel.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, wow.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But if any of you know what that is, it's basically a white asparagus, but asparagus is very popular in a lot of parts of the world.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So now we have our vegetables, we have our bread, but now we need to add a little bit of extra flavor to the sandwich.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So this is where we add some condiments.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So condiments are a category.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can have many different kinds of condiments.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The most common are salt and pepper.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So a condiment is a category of the things that you would add flavor to, as you said, salt, pepper, but here they mention, for example, mayonnaise or ketchup.

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ooh, and mustard as well.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
These are all condiments.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So in different parts of the world, they have different kinds of condiments.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I've seen, for example, a lot of vinegar in Asia.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You can also have hot pepper flakes like in Europe.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The condiments that you add to your sandwich are varied.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've seen people put all types of condiments in their sandwich.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And for example, one that may be a little bit strange or maybe a little bit more expensive condiment is caviar.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So caviar is not always considered a condiment.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It can be, but it can also be eaten alone, but it's basically just fish eggs.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They're little fish eggs.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Very small.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It always usually, in people's mind, it's kind of like a fancy food, very luxurious, very expensive.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, it can be very expensive if you get like beluga caviar.

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
A lot of caviar comes from the Caucasus and Russia and Ukraine, these places, and it's very salty in flavor.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So that is also considered a condiment in our case because we're using it for a sandwich, right?

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, so a lot of words there, a lot of interesting things going on in our sandwich.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder, where we're going to take a look at some phrases.

172
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Fluency Builder.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All right, so let's go back to the very beginning of the dialogue when she said, all right, let's start with the basics.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, the basics is a set phrase in this context.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We can say this about many different things, but the basics basically refers to the most simple ingredients or the most simple elements.

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In this case, bread, bread or meat, but you can also talk about the basics in other contexts.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like clothes shopping.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When school started when I was a kid, my mom always used to buy me the basics, so t-shirts and socks.

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So I guess the basics are the absolute necessary things, right?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And also very simple.

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So for example, if you talk about dancing, the basics would be maybe a certain sequence of steps that important, essential, right?

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And would caviar be a part of the basics, for example?

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, no, no.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No, that's an extra.

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So this is what we refer to when we say the basics.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now our chef, when she continued talking about her sandwich, she said, I would strongly recommend you use fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

189
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So you can say I would recommend this, but to strongly recommend is to have a very, very strong feeling about something.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's right.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're saying to the person, basically do it.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You must.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah.

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So if maybe your friend is sick, you can say something like, I would strongly recommend you go to the doctor today.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That means you really, really should go to the doctor.

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I would be upset if you didn't.

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's kind of formal though.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It seems like you would maybe use it with your boss or maybe with a person you don't really know that well, but with your friend, you would say, I really think you should go to the doctor.

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But you can say it in both contexts, but yeah, definitely more of a formal thing.

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay.

202
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So we strongly recommend it that you know.

203
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
All right.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So now for our last phrase, right?

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Where are we?

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Last but not least.

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All right.

209
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Now moving on to our next phrase.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When she started talking about the condiment, she said, last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments.

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay.

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This is a very, very common phrase.

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a set phrase.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You will hear these words together very often.

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Last but not least.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What could this possibly mean?

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So obviously last means the last step here.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The last point.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But why not least?

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, it's not least important.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Just because it's last, it doesn't mean that it's not important.

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So maybe there are many people who have to give presentations in school and I'm the very, very last person to go.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The teacher will say last but not least, Catherine.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's right.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Makes me feel better because you're saying you're last, but it doesn't mean you're not important.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Exactly.

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So when you want to make sure that the last point of your presentation or what you're talking about is not ignored or you want to make sure that everyone knows that it's also very important, you say last but not least.

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Great.

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
All right.

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And now last but not least, the end of Fluency Builder.

232
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We're going to close off with this little phrase.

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
When she was talking about salt and pepper, she said a touch of salt and pepper.

234
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Okay.

235
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
A touch of salt and pepper is basically a measure.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's not a lot.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's very little amount of salt and pepper.

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So we can say a touch.

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So it's not really a specific quantity though, right?

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We're not saying like a spoon of salt and pepper.

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Not at all.

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It basically means a little bit.

243
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
A little bit.

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So you're just saying maybe you'll hear this in maybe a cooking show or you'll read it in books when they'll say a pinch of salt or a touch of salt or a dash of salt.

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's right.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You could even say it about other things.

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:17,000
For example, if my friend just wrote this article and he wanted me to read it, I'd say it's a really good article but it could use a touch of humor.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay.

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think maybe if you made it a little bit funny, it would be better.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Or maybe if you're painting your house, you can say, oh, I think a touch of red paint would look really nice on this wall.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's right.

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
A little bit of red paint would be good.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So a touch of.

255
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
A really, really good phrase.

256
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It makes you sound very natural.

257
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay.

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So that's all the time we have for today.

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But before we go, let's listen to the dialogue again.

260
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Welcome to our show.

261
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you ready?

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's get started.

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Let's start with the basics.

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Bread.

266
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Bread is an important ingredient here.

267
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You need to remember one thing.

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb, and color.

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Of course, each person's palette is different but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

272
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

274
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The best choices here are evident.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

276
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can't go wrong with them.

277
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,000
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

279
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Till next time!

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Alright, so talking about sandwich, this really reminds me of making sandwiches at home.

284
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Grilled cheese sandwich.

285
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We didn't really talk about it here, but I think it's my favorite sandwich.

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The grilled cheese sandwich.

287
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Very easy to make, just two pieces of bread and cheese inside.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Do you use butter though?

289
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes.

290
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah, so you have to butter the bread, and so when you grill it, it gets really nice and brown.

291
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah.

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Actually, I'm not a very big sandwich fan when I'm having, for example, a meal like lunch.

293
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't really, I don't know, I think I need something more solid than just a sandwich at times.

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Interesting.

295
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I had a sandwich for dinner last night.

296
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Not that we speak about it, yeah.

297
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I had an egg salad sandwich.

298
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So you had egg salad inside two pieces of bread.

299
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's right, but the bread I had was French bread, so that long, thin bread was very crunchy, very delicious.

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But I actually, I like sandwiches for dinner.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They are a little bit lighter, yeah.

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:53,000
When you're having a big meal, it just seems like, although maybe sometimes places give you very big, heavy sandwiches that have, you know, like ham and salami and just a lot of things in there, so they're very, very filling.

303
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's very true.

304
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Like a meatball sub, for example, is a very heavy sandwich.

305
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's right.

306
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But sandwiches come in all shapes and sizes.

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can make basically any sandwich that your brain can think of, and so we hope that you've learned some words for talking about sandwiches today.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Of course, if you have any questions or comments or you want to share with us your very favorite sandwich, you should do so on EnglishPod.com.

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,000
All right.

310
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We'll see you guys there.

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Bye.

312
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Bye.
