Welcome to our show.

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,919
Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:14,960
Are you ready?

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,300
Let's get started.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,239
Let's start with the basics.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Bread.

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,579
Bread is an important ingredient here.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,519
You need to remember one thing.

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,160
Choose the bread according to the following criteria.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,920
Freshness, crumb, and color.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:38,500
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,259
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,719
Of course, each person's palette is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,079
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

16
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,200
The best choices here are evident.

17
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,659
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,340
You can't go wrong with them.

19
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:20,980
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,180
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

21
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:37,439
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

22
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:45,719
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

23
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:51,859
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

24
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,980
Till next time.
