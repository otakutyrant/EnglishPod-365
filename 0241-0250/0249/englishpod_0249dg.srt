00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to our show.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Are you ready?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's get started.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's start with the basics.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Bread.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Bread is an important ingredient here.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You need to remember one thing.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Choose the bread according to the following criteria.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Freshness, crumb, and color.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you want a closed sandwich, I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now that our bread is ready, let's talk about the ingredients.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Of course, each person's palette is different, but I'm going to give you a few tips that you'll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The best choices here are evident.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chili, lettuce, and of course herbs.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You can't go wrong with them.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
As for aubergines, mushrooms, and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We can be subtle and add just a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we'll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Till next time.
