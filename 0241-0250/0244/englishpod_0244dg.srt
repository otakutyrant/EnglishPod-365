EnglishPod.com Right, Rebecca.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism, and this seemed like a good first step.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Certainly.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And after your internship?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I ended up staying two years there, actually.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I really enjoyed it there, and it really helped me build my skills.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, I see.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My husband and I moved to London, and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To London Weekly, right?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.
