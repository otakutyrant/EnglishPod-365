EnglishPod.com Right, Rebecca.

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:11,039
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was...

3
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,460
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,239
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,539
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism, and this seemed like a good first step.

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:22,399
Certainly.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,780
And after your internship?

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,019
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

9
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:31,679
I ended up staying two years there, actually.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,640
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

11
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:38,039
I really enjoyed it there, and it really helped me build my skills.

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,780
Yes, I see.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,659
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,780
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,539
My husband and I moved to London, and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

16
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,979
To London Weekly, right?

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,579
Yes!

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:57,460
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.
