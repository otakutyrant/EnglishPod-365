00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have a new lesson in our series about interviewing for a new job.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is, of course, at the elementary level.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So this is part four of our interview series.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Remember, we are taking a look each week at giving you tips and also the proper language for when you have an interview in English.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And on this occasion, we're going to talk about our work experience.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, you remember we talked a little bit about educational experience and educational background.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, today is all about your last couple of jobs.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
All right, so I think we should just listen to the dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a bit with language takeaway.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Right, Rebecca.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was...

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism, and this seemed like a good first step.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Certainly.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And after your internship?

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I ended up staying two years there, actually.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I really enjoyed it there, and it really helped me build my skills.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, I see.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, that's right.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My husband and I moved to London, and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The London Weekly, right?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
In some ways, it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So now we've picked out a couple of key words, and we're gonna take a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So Marco, a lot of people don't start out as a professional with a job.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They have something else first.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What is this?

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's right.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A very popular way to begin your work experience, you become an intern, or you work as an intern.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, so the name of the job we could say is intern.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm an intern, or he's an intern at my company.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Exactly.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So usually interns work at a company.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Usually, they're not paid, or if they are, it's very, very little pay.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And the purpose of an internship, or to work as an intern, is to gain experience.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So it's basically like a study opportunity for a job that you know you want.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I could be an intern at a media company, and I could learn all about media, but it's not really a full job.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Exactly.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And usually, it serves as an opportunity to maybe continue working at that company in a full-time job.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So you become an intern, and the noun or what you are doing is called an internship.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I'm an intern, but what I have is an internship.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's like saying, I have a job.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I have an internship, but I am an intern.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Exactly.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, so we've covered those two words.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, let's move on to when she's describing her work experience in the York Herald, and she described it as a very good first step.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, so a first step, you think about your foot, your step, your moving, it means the very first thing you do when you're heading in some direction.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right, and professionally, I guess your first steps are maybe becoming an intern.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right, or you could say, my first step was working in the mail room at this big movie studio, but later I became a famous movie producer.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Exactly.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Exactly, so that's kind of like the way that you begin your professional life.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And well, then they started talking about the newspapers, and actually Rebecca was offered a position as a junior local news reporter.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, so junior means usually lower ranking or not experienced, someone who is just starting out.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And of course, after junior, we have senior.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So, a senior news reporter is someone who's worked for many, many years as a reporter.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Usually, I guess a junior news reporter would make less money than a senior news reporter.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Exactly, you could also say junior executive or senior executive.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Junior manager.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
These are ways of describing length of experience, and in this case she's junior, but what kind of a job does she have?

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, she is a news reporter for local issues.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay, so she's a local news reporter.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now, what exactly does that mean if you're a local news reporter or for local issues?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, if I live in Chicago and I'm a local news reporter, I only write or report the news about Chicago.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a way of describing the things in my area.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So it's the opposite of our next phrase, national news reporter.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, so if you are a national news reporter or a national manager of maybe a company, then that means that you oversee things in the whole country.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So local is my city or my county, but in the case of national, we're talking about the whole country, nation, national.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So national is an adjective, but we could even go further than this.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What if I am a reporter and I talk about foreign countries?

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I talk about France and South Africa and even Iceland.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then I guess you would be an international news reporter.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Exactly.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I guess also at the executive level, you can have an international marketing manager, That's right.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
International marketing manager, not national marketing manager.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
These are very important ways to divide work to say he is the international manager.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Here's the national manager.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This tells you the kind of the size of this person's job.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Exactly.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So now more or less, you'd know how these jobs can be divided junior, senior, national, local, et cetera.

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So I think we should go back to the dialogue.

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Right, Rebecca.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was?

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good first step.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Certainly.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And after your internship?

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I ended up staying two years there actually.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, I see.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, that's right.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The London Weekly, right?

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In some ways, it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right, so now let's start with a couple of phrases and phrasal verbs on Fluency Builder.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Fluency Builder.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot of really wonderful phrases, Marco.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Some of them are ways of making your experiences sound better, more professional even.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
For example, this first one, sorry, Rebecca's talking about her first job in York and she says, I was in charge of the sports news section.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In charge of.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So that phrase, I was in charge of or to be in charge of, what does this describe?

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This describes responsibility.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Basically, she's saying, I was responsible for or I had to manage the sports news section.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
She's taking credit for this job that was important.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, so this is a key phrase because this is the typical phrase that you use to describe your responsibilities or to describe what you did in your previous job position or your previous job.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So, right, I could ask you, when you were in marketing, what were you in charge of?

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Right, and then you say, well, I was in charge of, and then you explain your responsibilities or what you did.

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I was in charge of our national accounts or I was in charge of the local news.

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Exactly.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So this is a very simple phrase, just remember it, I was in charge of, and then you can start explaining what were your responsibilities, what you did in your previous job.

128
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Alright, moving on now towards the end of that paragraph, Rebecca says that, well, being in charge of the sports news section was really fun and it really helped her build my skills.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It really helped me build my skills.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So to build your skills, or in this case I build my skills, means that I have some skills but maybe they're not really developed, maybe, you know, I just finished college, I want more experience.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, in that time during my first job, I build my skills.

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I become better at writing or having interviews, things like that.

133
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Exactly.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So when you build your skills, you kind of improve your abilities or you gain more experience.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Alright, and another interesting phrase coming up here, when Rebecca talked about moving to London with her husband, she said, I managed to find a position with a national newspaper.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, so I managed to, or you could say to manage to do something.

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is a really interesting phrase because it's another way of saying to be able to or to succeed at something.

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, so don't confuse it with manager or to manage people.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That is also correct, obviously it exists, but to manage to do something is to, as you said, to be able to do something.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Right, so for example, I was running really late yesterday and I had a ticket for a train at five o'clock.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I thought I would miss the train, but I managed to get to the train on time.

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That means I was able to get on the train on time.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, so you managed to find a job.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I managed to get to the train on time.

145
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was able to.

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Alright, and towards the end, Rebecca talked about her job at the London Weekly and she described it as a step down from my previous job.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, is this a good thing or a bad thing, Marco?

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
To be a step down in something is a bad thing.

149
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's to reduce in level or to decrease.

150
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, so basically she's saying, listen, I have this really great job in New York and I took a new job in London and the new job, it wasn't as good in many ways because maybe she had less responsibility or maybe it paid less.

151
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So this is a way of saying it wasn't as good as my last job.

152
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, so her new job was a step down from her previous job.

153
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You could say, I think his new girlfriend is a bit of a step down, if you know what I mean.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Exactly.

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So usually you're comparing, right?

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're making a comparison between something from the past to now.

157
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Exactly.

158
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, so a step down.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back to talk to you in a bit.

160
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Right, Rebecca.

161
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was?

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

164
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good first step.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Certainly.

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And after your internship?

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I ended up staying two years there, actually.

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

171
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes, I see.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes, that's right.

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The London Weekly, right?

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All right, so talking about internships and interns, it seems that usually it's not very exciting to become an intern because it ends up that the office people just make you make coffee or copies and stuff like that.

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're not really gaining much work experience.

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That is the reputation in the United States for internships.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So basically when you agree to do an internship, sometimes you have to apply to do an internship.

182
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a very long process.

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You end up, like you say, making coffee for people or photocopying reports.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And this is really boring work.

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I think, yeah, that is the reputation that many places have, like you say, in the United States.

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But also, I don't know, I guess it does seem in a way the only opportunity in order to be able to get into an industry or a company.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Maybe it's a really good company, like Procter & Gamble.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And how else are you going to be able to get in there with no job experience?

189
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, that's right.

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And a lot of people know that an internship doesn't really give you work experience, but they still think that it gives you some edge or some advantage when you're looking for jobs later.

191
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because if I write down on my resume, we were talking earlier about resumes.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If I write down on my resume that I was an intern at Procter & Gamble, wow, that's really impressive.

193
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Right, it looks good.

194
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right, so this is an interesting topic.

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let us know if you were ever an intern.

196
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Maybe you started out as an internship, or maybe you're doing one now.

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Was it better than we say?

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Did you do anything else other than making coffee?

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We really hope so.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And we look forward to hearing about your experiences.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
All right, we'll see everyone at EnglishPod.com.

202
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And until next time.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Bye.
