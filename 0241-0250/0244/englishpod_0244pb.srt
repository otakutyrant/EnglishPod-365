00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,040
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:05,799
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:11,779
My name is Catherine, and today we have a new lesson in our series about interviewing for a new job.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,859
This is, of course, at the elementary level.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,720
That's right.

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,379
So this is part four of our interview series.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:25,480
Remember, we are taking a look each week at giving you tips and also the proper language for when you have an interview in English.

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,519
And on this occasion, we're going to talk about our work experience.

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,359
Okay, you remember we talked a little bit about educational experience and educational background.

10
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:37,140
Well, today is all about your last couple of jobs.

11
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:44,100
All right, so I think we should just listen to the dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a bit with language takeaway.

12
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,840
Right, Rebecca.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,519
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was...

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,960
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

15
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,719
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,040
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism, and this seemed like a good first step.

17
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:06,900
Certainly.

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,239
And after your internship?

19
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,500
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

20
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,180
I ended up staying two years there, actually.

21
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,120
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,540
I really enjoyed it there, and it really helped me build my skills.

23
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,280
Yes, I see.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,180
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

25
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,280
Yes, that's right.

26
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,060
My husband and I moved to London, and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

27
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,439
The London Weekly, right?

28
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,040
Yes.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,000
In some ways, it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:47,299
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:52,579
So now we've picked out a couple of key words, and we're gonna take a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:00,599
So Marco, a lot of people don't start out as a professional with a job.

34
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,799
They have something else first.

35
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,400
What is this?

36
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:02,879
That's right.

37
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:09,300
A very popular way to begin your work experience, you become an intern, or you work as an intern.

38
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,979
Okay, so the name of the job we could say is intern.

39
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,819
I'm an intern, or he's an intern at my company.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,580
Exactly.

41
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,840
So usually interns work at a company.

42
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,620
Usually, they're not paid, or if they are, it's very, very little pay.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
And the purpose of an internship, or to work as an intern, is to gain experience.

44
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,139
That's right.

45
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:36,199
So it's basically like a study opportunity for a job that you know you want.

46
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,520
I could be an intern at a media company, and I could learn all about media, but it's not really a full job.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,280
Exactly.

48
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,960
And usually, it serves as an opportunity to maybe continue working at that company in a full-time job.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,520
So you become an intern, and the noun or what you are doing is called an internship.

50
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,020
So I'm an intern, but what I have is an internship.

51
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:03,599
Right.

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,039
It's like saying, I have a job.

53
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,900
I have an internship, but I am an intern.

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,680
Exactly.

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,080
All right, so we've covered those two words.

56
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:22,740
Now, let's move on to when she's describing her work experience in the York Herald, and she described it as a very good first step.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:32,340
Okay, so a first step, you think about your foot, your step, your moving, it means the very first thing you do when you're heading in some direction.

58
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,939
Right, and professionally, I guess your first steps are maybe becoming an intern.

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,539
Right, or you could say, my first step was working in the mail room at this big movie studio, but later I became a famous movie producer.

60
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,439
Exactly.

61
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,659
Exactly, so that's kind of like the way that you begin your professional life.

62
00:03:53,639 --> 00:04:02,520
And well, then they started talking about the newspapers, and actually Rebecca was offered a position as a junior local news reporter.

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:11,419
Okay, so junior means usually lower ranking or not experienced, someone who is just starting out.

64
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,879
And of course, after junior, we have senior.

65
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:19,079
So, a senior news reporter is someone who's worked for many, many years as a reporter.

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,759
Usually, I guess a junior news reporter would make less money than a senior news reporter.

67
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,300
Exactly, you could also say junior executive or senior executive.

68
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,360
Junior manager.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,500
These are ways of describing length of experience, and in this case she's junior, but what kind of a job does she have?

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,720
Well, she is a news reporter for local issues.

71
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,560
Okay, so she's a local news reporter.

72
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,379
Now, what exactly does that mean if you're a local news reporter or for local issues?

73
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:55,360
Well, if I live in Chicago and I'm a local news reporter, I only write or report the news about Chicago.

74
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,019
It's a way of describing the things in my area.

75
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,319
So it's the opposite of our next phrase, national news reporter.

76
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:14,379
Okay, so if you are a national news reporter or a national manager of maybe a company, then that means that you oversee things in the whole country.

77
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,180
That's right.

78
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:23,759
So local is my city or my county, but in the case of national, we're talking about the whole country, nation, national.

79
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,740
So national is an adjective, but we could even go further than this.

80
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,939
What if I am a reporter and I talk about foreign countries?

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,439
I talk about France and South Africa and even Iceland.

82
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,680
Then I guess you would be an international news reporter.

83
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:38,279
Exactly.

84
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,779
And I guess also at the executive level, you can have an international marketing manager, That's right.

85
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,139
International marketing manager, not national marketing manager.

86
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:53,339
These are very important ways to divide work to say he is the international manager.

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,100
Here's the national manager.

88
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,279
This tells you the kind of the size of this person's job.

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,000
Exactly.

90
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:00,560
Okay.

91
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:10,040
So now more or less, you'd know how these jobs can be divided junior, senior, national, local, et cetera.

92
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,579
So I think we should go back to the dialogue.

93
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,220
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

94
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,819
Right, Rebecca.

95
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,459
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was?

96
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,959
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

97
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,699
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

98
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,040
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good first step.

99
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:38,879
Certainly.

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
And after your internship?

101
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,480
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

102
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,160
I ended up staying two years there actually.

103
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,120
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

104
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,519
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

105
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,279
Yes, I see.

106
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,160
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,279
Yes, that's right.

108
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,060
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

109
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,439
The London Weekly, right?

110
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,040
Yes.

111
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,100
In some ways, it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

112
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,180
All right, so now let's start with a couple of phrases and phrasal verbs on Fluency Builder.

113
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,240
Fluency Builder.

114
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,660
Okay, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot of really wonderful phrases, Marco.

115
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,000
Some of them are ways of making your experiences sound better, more professional even.

116
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,660
For example, this first one, sorry, Rebecca's talking about her first job in York and she says, I was in charge of the sports news section.

117
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:47,699
In charge of.

118
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,300
So that phrase, I was in charge of or to be in charge of, what does this describe?

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,399
This describes responsibility.

120
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:03,779
Basically, she's saying, I was responsible for or I had to manage the sports news section.

121
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,800
She's taking credit for this job that was important.

122
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:19,980
Okay, so this is a key phrase because this is the typical phrase that you use to describe your responsibilities or to describe what you did in your previous job position or your previous job.

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,879
So, right, I could ask you, when you were in marketing, what were you in charge of?

124
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:30,220
Right, and then you say, well, I was in charge of, and then you explain your responsibilities or what you did.

125
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,019
I was in charge of our national accounts or I was in charge of the local news.

126
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:36,779
Exactly.

127
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:47,139
So this is a very simple phrase, just remember it, I was in charge of, and then you can start explaining what were your responsibilities, what you did in your previous job.

128
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:59,860
Alright, moving on now towards the end of that paragraph, Rebecca says that, well, being in charge of the sports news section was really fun and it really helped her build my skills.

129
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,519
It really helped me build my skills.

130
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:15,620
So to build your skills, or in this case I build my skills, means that I have some skills but maybe they're not really developed, maybe, you know, I just finished college, I want more experience.

131
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,039
Well, in that time during my first job, I build my skills.

132
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:24,200
I become better at writing or having interviews, things like that.

133
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:24,820
Exactly.

134
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,799
So when you build your skills, you kind of improve your abilities or you gain more experience.

135
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:42,019
Alright, and another interesting phrase coming up here, when Rebecca talked about moving to London with her husband, she said, I managed to find a position with a national newspaper.

136
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,419
Okay, so I managed to, or you could say to manage to do something.

137
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,940
This is a really interesting phrase because it's another way of saying to be able to or to succeed at something.

138
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Okay, so don't confuse it with manager or to manage people.

139
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:09,779
That is also correct, obviously it exists, but to manage to do something is to, as you said, to be able to do something.

140
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,899
Right, so for example, I was running really late yesterday and I had a ticket for a train at five o'clock.

141
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:21,159
I thought I would miss the train, but I managed to get to the train on time.

142
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:24,039
That means I was able to get on the train on time.

143
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:27,779
Okay, so you managed to find a job.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,600
I managed to get to the train on time.

145
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,039
I was able to.

146
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:41,759
Alright, and towards the end, Rebecca talked about her job at the London Weekly and she described it as a step down from my previous job.

147
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,240
Okay, is this a good thing or a bad thing, Marco?

148
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,179
To be a step down in something is a bad thing.

149
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,700
It's to reduce in level or to decrease.

150
00:10:51,659 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, so basically she's saying, listen, I have this really great job in New York and I took a new job in London and the new job, it wasn't as good in many ways because maybe she had less responsibility or maybe it paid less.

151
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,340
So this is a way of saying it wasn't as good as my last job.

152
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,519
Okay, so her new job was a step down from her previous job.

153
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,659
You could say, I think his new girlfriend is a bit of a step down, if you know what I mean.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,279
Exactly.

155
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,179
So usually you're comparing, right?

156
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,980
You're making a comparison between something from the past to now.

157
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:27,600
Exactly.

158
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,120
Okay, so a step down.

159
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,379
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back to talk to you in a bit.

160
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:43,679
Right, Rebecca.

161
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,279
Now I see that after graduating from university, your first job was?

162
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,799
For a local paper in York called the York Herald.

163
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,559
Actually, I started with them as an intern.

164
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:58,879
I was really keen on getting some experience in journalism and this seemed like a good first step.

165
00:11:59,399 --> 00:11:59,740
Certainly.

166
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,080
And after your internship?

167
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,340
They seemed impressed and offered me a position as a junior local news reporter.

168
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,000
I ended up staying two years there, actually.

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,980
I was in charge of the sports news section of the newspaper.

170
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:15,360
I really enjoyed it there and it really helped me build my skills.

171
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,120
Yes, I see.

172
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,980
But you decided to leave them in 2006, right?

173
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,100
Yes, that's right.

174
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,879
My husband and I moved to London and so I managed to find a position with a national newspaper based in London.

175
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,279
The London Weekly, right?

176
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:28,879
Yes.

177
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,799
In some ways it was a step down from my previous job, but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.

178
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:58,539
All right, so talking about internships and interns, it seems that usually it's not very exciting to become an intern because it ends up that the office people just make you make coffee or copies and stuff like that.

179
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,360
You're not really gaining much work experience.

180
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,799
That is the reputation in the United States for internships.

181
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:09,340
So basically when you agree to do an internship, sometimes you have to apply to do an internship.

182
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,279
It's a very long process.

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,460
You end up, like you say, making coffee for people or photocopying reports.

184
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:18,179
And this is really boring work.

185
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,360
I think, yeah, that is the reputation that many places have, like you say, in the United States.

186
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:33,460
But also, I don't know, I guess it does seem in a way the only opportunity in order to be able to get into an industry or a company.

187
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,299
Maybe it's a really good company, like Procter & Gamble.

188
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,159
And how else are you going to be able to get in there with no job experience?

189
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:41,759
Well, that's right.

190
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:54,419
And a lot of people know that an internship doesn't really give you work experience, but they still think that it gives you some edge or some advantage when you're looking for jobs later.

191
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,980
Because if I write down on my resume, we were talking earlier about resumes.

192
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,899
If I write down on my resume that I was an intern at Procter & Gamble, wow, that's really impressive.

193
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:04,700
Right, it looks good.

194
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
All right, so this is an interesting topic.

195
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,740
Let us know if you were ever an intern.

196
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,679
Maybe you started out as an internship, or maybe you're doing one now.

197
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,419
Was it better than we say?

198
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,659
Did you do anything else other than making coffee?

199
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:17,580
We really hope so.

200
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,980
And we look forward to hearing about your experiences.

201
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,419
All right, we'll see everyone at EnglishPod.com.

202
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:23,659
And until next time.

203
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:23,980
Bye.
