EnglishPod.com Honey, can you set the table?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Um, sure.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What are we having for dinner?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight, so set an extra placemat just in case.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, should I use the fancy silverware?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, go ahead.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Forks, spoons, and knives.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also there.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oops.
