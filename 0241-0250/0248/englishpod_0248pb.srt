00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:05,339
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,980
My name is Katherine, and today we've got another lesson all about food and eating.

4
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,739
So today we're going to talk about all the tools that we use when we're at the table, so what we use when we're eating.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,640
That's right.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:24,179
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and when we come back, we'll talk about some of these words and some of the great phrases you're learning today.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,859
Honey, can you set the table?

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,119
Well, I'm sure.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,219
What are we having for dinner?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,520
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,439
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,579
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight, so set an extra placemat just in case.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:44,579
Okay.

14
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,000
Should I use the fancy silverware?

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,060
Yeah, go ahead.

16
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,600
Forks, spoons, and knives.

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,640
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,619
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,359
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,460
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,480
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also thi- Oops.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,840
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of words in language takeaway.

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,180
Language takeaway.

24
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,540
So our first word is a very important one.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,519
You might have heard it before.

26
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,980
The word is silverware.

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,620
Okay, silverware.

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,079
Now this means that it's usually made something that's made out of silver, right?

29
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:32,799
It could be.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,780
Maybe traditionally it's made out of silver, but it doesn't have to be.

31
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,799
You could have wooden silverware or other metals.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,359
It's basically the things that you use to eat food with.

33
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,060
Okay, so we're going to take this as a category.

34
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:56,000
Silverware are all the tools that we use to eat food with, and in this, so for example, a fork is a part of a silverware.

35
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,140
It's a kind of silverware fork.

36
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:04,140
A fork is the one that you usually put in your mouth with a piece of lettuce or meat or something.

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,540
Okay, so it's pointy.

38
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,379
It has like four little points.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,979
Now the one that we use to have dessert or to have soup with, we call that a spoon.

40
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,500
A spoon, that's right.

41
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:18,620
So to eat yogurt or ice cream, you use a spoon.

42
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,800
And finally, to cut things, you use a knife.

43
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,439
Okay, so in the dialogue, we saw the plural form, knives, but singular, it would be knife.

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,379
That's right.

45
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,500
And sometimes there are foods that are very, very hard to cut.

46
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:36,659
For example, steak is very hard to cut because it's a tough meat.

47
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:39,379
And so in that case, we use a steak knife to cut it.

48
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,520
Okay, so we have a knife or a steak knife.

49
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,180
Steak knife more specifically is used to cut meats.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,900
All right, so these are three kinds or actually four kinds of silverware.

51
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,879
Of course, there are other kinds, but those are the most important.

52
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,360
After that, though, we have something that's important for making your food taste better.

53
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,560
So what if I want to add salt or pepper?

54
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:01,680
What are those things called?

55
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,439
Those are called salt and pepper shakers.

56
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,939
We saw them in the dialogue that we need to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

57
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,240
So the little thing where you keep the salt is called a shaker.

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,900
That's right, because the action, the verb is to shake.

59
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,259
That means moving your hand up and down so some salt will fall out onto your food.

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,099
Exactly.

61
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,500
So usually it's only salt and pepper that we keep in these things and these little shakers.

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:36,139
But apart from salt and pepper shakers and all the silverware we're putting out, we're also putting out some saucers because we're going to have coffee later on.

63
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:41,580
Okay, so this normally goes together with cups, cups and saucers, but everyone knows what a cup is.

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,479
What is a saucer?

65
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:47,639
So a saucer is this little plate that you put under the cup when you're having coffee.

66
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,580
So usually that's where you keep your spoon or maybe the little bag of tea.

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay, so a saucer is important because it also helps in case you spill some coffee or tea so the coffee or tea doesn't go on the ground.

68
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:00,860
It goes on the plate.

69
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:01,460
Exactly.

70
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,560
So that little plate is called a saucer.

71
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:07,439
Now where do we keep all the plates, all the silverware?

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,479
We usually keep them in a cupboard.

73
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:16,100
Okay, so you might want to say cupboard because it's cup, C-U-P-B-O-A-R-D.

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,959
That's not right.

75
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,300
The word is pronounced cupboard.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,840
Okay, so even though it may seem like you should pronounce cupboard, the correct pronunciation is cupboard.

77
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,079
Cupboard.

78
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,139
Cupboard.

79
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:38,100
Cupboard, like you said, is usually in the dining room or the kitchen because it houses, it keeps all of our plates and bowls and sometimes our silverware.

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,160
That's right.

81
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:46,519
Okay, so actually in the cupboard we also have some other things, dishes, specifically we have a gravy boat in there.

82
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:52,740
Okay, so I'm not even sure why they call it a boat, but a gravy boat is basically a special dish.

83
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:59,279
It's like a tall bowl with a spout, so you can pour it, that keeps gravy.

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,120
So gravy is like a liquid or a sauce that goes on top of meat or potatoes.

85
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,079
I guess it kind of looks like a boat.

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,220
Just imagine a boat, but inside it's empty, so then that's where you put the gravy in.

87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:10,899
You pour it.

88
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,620
You can pour it.

89
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,759
All right, and so we can find that.

90
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:23,399
We can also find serving dishes, which are basically big plates or bowls that we use when we're having dinner at the dinner table to keep, for example, a turkey or a roast.

91
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,860
And specifically we were also looking for wine glasses.

92
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:35,240
Well, maybe we weren't looking for them, but they found us because the person getting stuff out of the cupboard dropped some wine glasses.

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,839
These are very, very easy to break.

94
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:44,259
Wine glasses are basically just glasses that maybe are tall and you drink wine out of them.

95
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:44,800
That's right.

96
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,759
So there's a specific type of glass usually used to drink wine.

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,639
So wine glasses, I guess a normal glass that you use to drink maybe juice or water is just called a glass.

98
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,120
You wouldn't say wine glass.

99
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,759
Only when you're drinking wine.

100
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,899
Okay.

101
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:05,540
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here, a lot of tools that we use at the dinner table when we're having dinner.

102
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,680
So let's listen to the dialogue again and review.

103
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,899
Honey, can you set the table?

104
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,160
Um, sure.

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,220
What are we having for dinner?

106
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,540
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,480
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,579
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight, so set an extra place mat just in case.

109
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:27,600
Okay.

110
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,019
Should I use the fancy silverware?

111
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,100
Yeah, go ahead.

112
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,639
Forks, spoons and knives.

113
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,699
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

114
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,759
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.

115
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,420
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

116
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,519
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

117
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,420
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also the...

118
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,600
Oops.

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,959
All right, we're back.

120
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,639
So now we have four key phrases that we've prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,740
Fluency Builder.

122
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, so this first phrase is very important, especially as a child.

123
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,199
Your mother or father might ask you to do this.

124
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,300
The phrase is, to set the table.

125
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:17,879
Okay, so that's a phrasal verb, to set the table, and what does it mean if you're asked to set the table?

126
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,319
It means you will put down the plates and the silverware and the bowls so that everything is prepared for dinner.

127
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:38,300
Okay, so this is actually what we were doing, and a complementary phrasal verb to this, when you're setting the table, as you said, you are putting down or putting out the different spoons, knives, dishes, all that stuff.

128
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:46,660
Right, so the verbal phrase, to put out, means to place down or to make sure that you get something out on the table.

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,740
In this case, my mother would usually ask me to put out extra glasses for water, okay, or don't forget to put out the wine glasses in case we're drinking wine.

130
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:56,920
It just means to place down.

131
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:57,620
Exactly.

132
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:07,420
So just remember that we use it because all these things, they're inside the cupboard, so you have to take them out, so you have to put them out on the table, all right?

133
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:22,579
And sometimes we may have a guest or we may need an extra chair or an extra seat because we're having company, and the person in the dialogue said to set an extra placemat just in case.

134
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:30,899
Okay, so a placemat is basically a piece of plastic or maybe fabric that you put in front of a person when they're at the table.

135
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,960
So it's on the table, and it's something that protects the table.

136
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,120
So it's small.

137
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,240
Everyone has one, and the bowl and the silverware will go on top of that placemat.

138
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,919
But it also indicates that that is where someone will sit, okay?

139
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:51,600
So to put out or to set out an extra placemat means to prepare an extra place for someone else who will be coming.

140
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:55,940
So if you have a guest, for example, you'll set out an extra placemat for him or for her.

141
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:07,539
Okay, so we can say set an extra placemat because by this we are referring that somebody is going to sit down at the table, or you can just simply say set an extra place for someone.

142
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:08,299
That's right.

143
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,080
Set an extra place.

144
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:11,500
Your older brother is coming home from college tonight.

145
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,500
Okay, so we can set an extra place for him at the table.

146
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,179
And well, in this case, we didn't know if the brother was really coming or not, so she said, just in case.

147
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,200
This is a great phrase, one that you'll hear all the time.

148
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:32,960
It means I'm not sure what the result will be or what the outcome will be, but in case something happens or just in case we should do this.

149
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:35,679
So for example, Marco, I think it's going to rain today.

150
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,840
You should bring an umbrella just in case.

151
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,899
Okay, so this is a way of saying you're preventing something.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,720
You're prepared.

153
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,299
Maybe if it does rain, you'll have an umbrella.

154
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,700
Just in case, bring your umbrella.

155
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,600
Okay, so a lot of great phrases there.

156
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,799
A lot of vocab, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time.

157
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,679
Honey, can you set the table?

158
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:02,960
Um, sure.

159
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,039
What are we having for dinner?

160
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,340
Do I need to put anything out in particular?

161
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,320
Well, make sure to put out the pepper and salt shakers.

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,379
I don't know if your brother is coming tonight, so set an extra place, Matt, just in case.

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,820
Okay, should I use the fancy silverware?

164
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,899
Yeah, go ahead.

165
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,419
Forks, spoons, and knives.

166
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,480
I roasted some meat, so be sure to put out some steak knives as well.

167
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,419
I'll also set some cups and saucers for some coffee after dinner.

168
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,220
Honey, have you seen our soup bowls?

169
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,299
They're in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes.

170
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,019
Just be careful because the wine glasses are also thi- Oops.

171
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:49,519
All right, we're back, so talking about dinner and silverware, there are also a couple of other names that we didn't mention.

172
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:53,919
For example, many people refer to ceramic plates as china.

173
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,139
Yeah, these are usually the fancy kinds of plates and dishes that you have in your house.

174
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:21,940
Obviously, if you have just kind of cheap ceramics that you can throw away, or even paper plates, those aren't very important, but at a wedding or in a special occasion, a person or a family might receive china-ware, china, and that is very nice, very pretty porcelain plates or just lacquerware.

175
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:30,080
Okay, so you can call it china-ware, which is basically plates that are either very fine ceramic or porcelain, as you said.

176
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:30,460
That's right.

177
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,580
Or what was the other word that you said before?

178
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:33,519
Lacquerware.

179
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,139
Lacquerware is a certain kind of plate or ceramic that has a kind of sheen to it.

180
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,259
It's got a special kind of basically paint job.

181
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,259
Oh, okay.

182
00:11:44,080 --> 00:12:02,779
Yeah, because it's always been kind of strange, the fact that a name like china would also now be related to plates, but apparently, I guess, because Chinese porcelain is renowned as being such high quality, I guess this is why now we just have a word for it called china or china-ware.

183
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:14,539
I think it actually has to do with the fact that the Chinese in the old days sold, well, most of the British bought their porcelain from China, and so it was very, very in vogue.

184
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,120
It was very popular, and it was basically the only thing that the British wanted.

185
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,200
They just wanted all of this china, and it became a part of the vocabulary then.

186
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:27,659
It's really strange, though, that you would call something china.

187
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,759
It's like, I don't know any other country that you call something French.

188
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,220
This is a French.

189
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:35,500
Yeah, I'm not sure.

190
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:35,700
Or Frenchware.

191
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,559
I don't know.

192
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,740
I can't think of any.

193
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,460
Limoges is the name of a city in France, and it's a certain kind of ceramics.

194
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,399
Oh, there you go.

195
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,820
All right, so an interesting topic.

196
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:52,480
There are many other tools that we didn't mention, like salad fork and ice cream spoon.

197
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,279
I don't know.

198
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,899
There are so many.

199
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,559
Sometimes if you go to a fancy dinner, you will have maybe three spoons, three knives, three forks, and you don't know what to do with it.

200
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,120
Start on the outside and go in.

201
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,340
That's my one recommendation.

202
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,279
Exactly.

203
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:06,679

208
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,600
