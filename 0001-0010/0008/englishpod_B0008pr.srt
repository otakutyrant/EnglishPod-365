00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:06,099
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:06,919
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,039
How are you, Erica?

5
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,039
Marco, I'm doing really well today.

6
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:10,880
You're excited?

7
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:11,380
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:13,060
We've got a great lesson for everyone.

9
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,239
Yes, we have a really common situation where we're going to use real English, right?

10
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:17,679
Yep.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,679
Everyday English.

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,760
English that people really use.

13
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:22,219
And that's what we want you to learn.

14
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,480
What are we talking about today specifically?

15
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,640
Today we have a really common situation that is a little bit embarrassing.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,579
Alright, an embarrassing situation.

17
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,460
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be kind of fast.

18
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:44,609
Yeah, but don't worry if you don't understand everything because after 10 minutes you'll understand everything.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:45,840
Perfect.

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,780
Alright, let's listen.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,539
Nick, how's it going?

22
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,240
Oh, hey.

23
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,600
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,840
Do you live around here?

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,299
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,739
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,590
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

29
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,840
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

30
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:19,420
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,620
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,620
You know what?

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,319
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

34
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,359
Can you remind me?

35
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,120
Sure.

36
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,700
My name is Anna Faris.

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,700
Don't worry about it.

38
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:34,379
It happens to me all the time.

39
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:36,219
I'm terrible with names too.

40
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,260
Wow, Nick forgot her name.

41
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,719
Yeah, that's happened to me a couple of times and I'm going to tell you about it a little bit later.

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,519
Okay, alright, well let's start with our three language takeaways.

43
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,959
So our first word on our language takeaway is in a bit of a hurry.

44
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,959
In a bit of a hurry.

45
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,719
In a bit of a hurry.

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,000
In a bit of a hurry.

47
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,080
So Nick was in a hurry.

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,180
Yeah, that's right.

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,960
This is a great phrase, so let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase.

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,900
Can you drive faster?

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,180
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,840
I can't talk right now.

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,740
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

54
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,860
I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll check these files later.

55
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,080
Okay, so it's clear now.

56
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,900
Basically it means that you don't have time.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
You're moving really quickly.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,639
Okay, perfect.

59
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,880
Now let's look at our second language takeaway word and it's contact details.

60
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:02,599
Contact details.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,159
Contact details.

62
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,560
Contact details.

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,460
So what are your contact details?

64
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,840
Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card.

65
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,500
Alright, so we have like our name, our telephone number.

66
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,280
Your email address, perhaps your mobile phone number.

67
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,599
So all the useful information so people can get in touch with you.

68
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,699
Yep, so people can phone you or email you.

69
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,900
Okay, so contact details.

70
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:28,800
Great.

71
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Okay, so our third word is slipped my mind.

72
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:33,960
Slipped my mind.

73
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,780
Slipped my mind.

74
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,099
Slipped my mind.

75
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,780
So this is a funny phrase.

76
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,139
It's kind of strange, right?

77
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,620
Yeah, slipped my mind.

78
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,240
It sounds very weird.

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,919
Exactly.

80
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,080
Okay, so now we're going to listen to two examples of this phrase.

81
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,280
Try and see if you can figure out what it means.

82
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,020
Example one.

83
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,919
I'm sorry I forgot to respond to your email.

84
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,419
It just slipped my mind.

85
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,280
Example two.

86
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,500
Don't you know what day it is today?

87
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,919
Oh, it's your birthday.

88
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,120
It completely slipped my mind.

89
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:19,839
Ah, so slipped my mind is like I forgot.

90
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,240
You forgot something.

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,399
Accidentally.

92
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:22,980
Right.

93
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:23,819
Okay, great.

94
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,420
Now it's time for putting it together.

95
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,459
Putting it together.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,480
Alright, Erika, why don't you tell our listeners what putting it together is.

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
Well, putting it together helps you put language together.

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,639
It helps you be more fluent by knowing how words fit together.

99
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Great, so let's look at our first phrase today.

100
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,300
And it's around here.

101
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,420
Around here.

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,839
Around here.

103
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,399
Around here.

104
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,720
So this is like close by.

105
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:55,800
Close by, right.

106
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,660
I can say, for example, is there a bank around here?

107
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,639
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,899
So that's, is there a bank close to here?

109
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:03,560
Exactly.

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:10,040
Now, this phrase around here, we can change it a little bit and it means something a little bit different.

111
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,240
I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant right around the corner.

112
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,800
Right, and that would mean there is a great restaurant on the other street.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,319
Yep.

114
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,399
Around the corner.

115
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:21,720
Yep.

116
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,519
Great.

117
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,519
Or we have another example.

118
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,259
We can say around there.

119
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,300
Around there.

120
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:27,779
Right.

121
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,199
So for example, I can say, Los Angeles is a great city.

122
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,939
I used to live around there.

123
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,459
So you used to live near Los Angeles.

124
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,060
Exactly.

125
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:37,819
Alright.

126
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,800
It's a really good phrase and it's really common.

127
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:41,240
Yeah.

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,019
Now our next phrase and putting it together is terrible with.

129
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,279
Terrible with.

130
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,319
Terrible with.

131
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:49,540
Terrible with.

132
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:54,680
So we have a couple of examples that will show you how this phrase works.

133
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,040
Example one.

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,899
You're terrible with numbers.

135
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,759
You can't even remember your own telephone number.

136
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:09,800
Example two.

137
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,879
I'm terrible with directions.

138
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,300
I'm always getting lost.

139
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,399
Example three.

140
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,240
I'm terrible with faces.

141
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,860
I can never remember what people look like.

142
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,959
Wow, I understand that.

143
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,339
I'm also terrible with numbers.

144
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,959
I can barely add two plus two.

145
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,639
Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is a numbers person.

146
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,519
I'm terrible with faces.

147
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,259
I sometimes forget what people look like.

148
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,579
Really?

149
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,079
Yeah.

150
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:45,579
Uh-oh.

151
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,220
So I think it's time now for us to listen to our dialogue a second time.

152
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,500
Okay, this time the dialogue will be a little bit slower.

153
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,100
Right.

154
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,460
So try and listen for some of the words we've just talked about.

155
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,839
Nick, how's it going?

156
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,279
Oh, hey.

157
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,819
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

158
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,819
Do you live around here?

159
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,600
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

160
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,420
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

161
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,620
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

162
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,720
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

163
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,540
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

164
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,220
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

165
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,639
Sure.

166
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:40,680
You still have my contact details, right?

167
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,480
You know what?

168
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,699
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

169
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,680
Can you remind me?

170
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:50,600
Sure.

171
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,600
My name is Anna Faris.

172
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:55,720
Don't worry about it.

173
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,439
It happens to me all the time.

174
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,660
I'm terrible with names, too.

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,420
So it's more clear now.

176
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,040
You can understand a lot better, right?

177
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,040
Yeah, that's true.

178
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,720
Great.

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,939
So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,319
Fluency Builder.

181
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:24,720
So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases and show you how you can be more fluent or how you can...

182
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:25,959
Sound more native.

183
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,699
Yeah.

184
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:27,319
Great.

185
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,039
In the beginning of the dialogue, Anna said, Nick, how's it going?

186
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,759
Yeah, this is a great phrase.

187
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,379
It sounds really, really natural.

188
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,539
You know, sometimes I hear students say, how are you?

189
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,299
Or how are you doing?

190
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,259
Those are two great phrases, but this one sounds really, really natural.

191
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,679
It just sounds more casual.

192
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,019
Yeah, let's listen again to that phrase from the dialogue.

193
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,620
How's it going?

194
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,519
How's it going?

195
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,440
Great.

196
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,600
So next time that you find a friend on the street, you can just say, hey, how's it going?

197
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,240
Yeah.

198
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,200
So Marco, have you ever forgotten someone's name?

199
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,279
Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times.

200
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:16,019
And actually, the most embarrassing situation was that I forgot a family member's name.

201
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,480
No, a family member's name.

202
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:26,919
We had like a family reunion, and there were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins that I hadn't seen in a while, and I just forgot one of my uncle's names.

203
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:29,220
Uh-oh, that's pretty embarrassing.

204
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,399
So what did you do?

205
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:33,559
Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins.

206
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,620
And I'm like, hey, who is that guy?

207
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,139
He's like, oh, that's Uncle John.

208
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:37,879
I'm like, oh, man, I totally forgot.

209
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:44,820
Yeah, so it was really embarrassing because I didn't know what to call him, so I just called him Uncle because I didn't know his name.

210
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:45,539
Hi, Uncle.

211
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,080
Yeah.

212
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:47,480
Oh, yeah.

213
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:55,340
So when that happens to me when I'm in a business setting, sometimes what I do is I ask for someone's card.

214
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,399
Ah, yeah, that's the good technique.

215
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:06,080
Yeah, or sometimes I might ask them to write down their email because usually their full name is spelled out on their email address, so that's my trick when I've forgotten someone's name.

216
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,120
That's a good trick, and I guess a lot of our listeners can take your advice on that.

217
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:18,360
Okay, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue one more time, this time at natural speed.

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,580
Nick, how's it going?

219
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,279
Oh, hey.

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,639
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

221
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,879
Do you live around here?

222
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,320
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

223
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,220
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

224
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:40,759
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

225
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,100
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

226
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,840
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

227
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,460
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

228
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,659
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

229
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,659
You know what?

230
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,360
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

231
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,340
Please, can you remind me?

232
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,139
Sure.

233
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,720
My name is Anna Faris.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,740
Don't worry about it.

235
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,419
It happens to me all the time.

236
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm terrible with names, too.

237
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:23,320
