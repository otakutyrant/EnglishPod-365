00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How are you, Erica?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Marco, I'm doing really well today.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're excited?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We've got a great lesson for everyone.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, we have a really common situation where we're going to use real English, right?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yep.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Everyday English.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
English that people really use.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And that's what we want you to learn.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What are we talking about today specifically?

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today we have a really common situation that is a little bit embarrassing.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Alright, an embarrassing situation.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and it's going to be kind of fast.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, but don't worry if you don't understand everything because after 10 minutes you'll understand everything.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Perfect.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Alright, let's listen.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Nick, how's it going?

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, hey.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Do you live around here?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You know what?

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can you remind me?

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sure.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My name is Anna Faris.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't worry about it.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It happens to me all the time.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm terrible with names too.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Wow, Nick forgot her name.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, that's happened to me a couple of times and I'm going to tell you about it a little bit later.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, alright, well let's start with our three language takeaways.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So our first word on our language takeaway is in a bit of a hurry.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In a bit of a hurry.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In a bit of a hurry.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In a bit of a hurry.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So Nick was in a hurry.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, that's right.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is a great phrase, so let's listen to three examples of how you can use this phrase.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Can you drive faster?

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can't talk right now.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm in a bit of a hurry, so I'll check these files later.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, so it's clear now.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Basically it means that you don't have time.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're moving really quickly.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, perfect.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now let's look at our second language takeaway word and it's contact details.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Contact details.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Contact details.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Contact details.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So what are your contact details?

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Basically, this is the information you can find on your business card.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Alright, so we have like our name, our telephone number.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your email address, perhaps your mobile phone number.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So all the useful information so people can get in touch with you.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yep, so people can phone you or email you.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, so contact details.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Great.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, so our third word is slipped my mind.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Slipped my mind.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Slipped my mind.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Slipped my mind.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So this is a funny phrase.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's kind of strange, right?

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah, slipped my mind.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It sounds very weird.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, so now we're going to listen to two examples of this phrase.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Try and see if you can figure out what it means.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Example one.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry I forgot to respond to your email.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It just slipped my mind.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Example two.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't you know what day it is today?

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, it's your birthday.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It completely slipped my mind.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ah, so slipped my mind is like I forgot.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You forgot something.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Accidentally.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay, great.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now it's time for putting it together.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Putting it together.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Alright, Erika, why don't you tell our listeners what putting it together is.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, putting it together helps you put language together.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It helps you be more fluent by knowing how words fit together.

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Great, so let's look at our first phrase today.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And it's around here.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Around here.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Around here.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Around here.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So this is like close by.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Close by, right.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can say, for example, is there a bank around here?

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So that's, is there a bank close to here?

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Exactly.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now, this phrase around here, we can change it a little bit and it means something a little bit different.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I could say, Marco, there's a great restaurant right around the corner.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right, and that would mean there is a great restaurant on the other street.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yep.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Around the corner.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yep.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Great.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Or we have another example.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We can say around there.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Around there.

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Right.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So for example, I can say, Los Angeles is a great city.

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I used to live around there.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So you used to live near Los Angeles.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Exactly.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Alright.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a really good phrase and it's really common.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yeah.

128
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now our next phrase and putting it together is terrible with.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Terrible with.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Terrible with.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Terrible with.

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So we have a couple of examples that will show you how this phrase works.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Example one.

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're terrible with numbers.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can't even remember your own telephone number.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Example two.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm terrible with directions.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm always getting lost.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Example three.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm terrible with faces.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can never remember what people look like.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wow, I understand that.

143
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm also terrible with numbers.

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can barely add two plus two.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, yeah, I guess not everyone is a numbers person.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm terrible with faces.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I sometimes forget what people look like.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Uh-oh.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So I think it's time now for us to listen to our dialogue a second time.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, this time the dialogue will be a little bit slower.

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Right.

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So try and listen for some of the words we've just talked about.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Nick, how's it going?

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, hey.

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you live around here?

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sure.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You still have my contact details, right?

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You know what?

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Can you remind me?

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sure.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
My name is Anna Faris.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't worry about it.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It happens to me all the time.

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm terrible with names, too.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it's more clear now.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can understand a lot better, right?

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, that's true.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Great.

179
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Fluency Builder.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So with Fluency Builder, we take some very simple phrases and show you how you can be more fluent or how you can...

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sound more native.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Great.

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In the beginning of the dialogue, Anna said, Nick, how's it going?

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, this is a great phrase.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It sounds really, really natural.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You know, sometimes I hear students say, how are you?

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Or how are you doing?

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Those are two great phrases, but this one sounds really, really natural.

191
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It just sounds more casual.

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, let's listen again to that phrase from the dialogue.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How's it going?

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How's it going?

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Great.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So next time that you find a friend on the street, you can just say, hey, how's it going?

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So Marco, have you ever forgotten someone's name?

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, it's happened to me a couple of times.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And actually, the most embarrassing situation was that I forgot a family member's name.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, a family member's name.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We had like a family reunion, and there were a lot of aunts and uncles and cousins that I hadn't seen in a while, and I just forgot one of my uncle's names.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Uh-oh, that's pretty embarrassing.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So what did you do?

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, I had to ask one of my other cousins.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I'm like, hey, who is that guy?

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's like, oh, that's Uncle John.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm like, oh, man, I totally forgot.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, so it was really embarrassing because I didn't know what to call him, so I just called him Uncle because I didn't know his name.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hi, Uncle.

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, yeah.

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So when that happens to me when I'm in a business setting, sometimes what I do is I ask for someone's card.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ah, yeah, that's the good technique.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, or sometimes I might ask them to write down their email because usually their full name is spelled out on their email address, so that's my trick when I've forgotten someone's name.

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's a good trick, and I guess a lot of our listeners can take your advice on that.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue one more time, this time at natural speed.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Nick, how's it going?

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, hey.

220
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing in this neighborhood?

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you live around here?

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Actually, my office is right around the corner.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It was great to meet you last week at the conference.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, yeah, it was really interesting.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know, I'm in a bit of a hurry, but here's my card.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion.

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sure, you still have my contact details, right?

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know what?

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is really embarrassing, but your name has just slipped my mind.

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Please, can you remind me?

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sure.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
My name is Anna Faris.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't worry about it.

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It happens to me all the time.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm terrible with names, too.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:23,000
