00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,582
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:07,542
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,470
Hey, Amira.

5
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:09,276
How are you today?

6
00:00:09,508 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm doing great.

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,956
What about you?

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,460
I'm doing pretty good.

9
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,209
I'm excited about this, uh, lesson that you have for us today.

10
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:19,443
Yes, it's actually a very, very useful lesson.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,386
It's about someone asking his boss for an assistant.

12
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:24,643
Oh, okay, an assistant.

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,493
What's an assistant?

14
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,899
Well, it's someone who helps you with your work around the office.

15
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,201
Okay, great.

16
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's listen to this, uh, dialogue, and when we come back, we'll take a look at all the interesting and useful vocabulary that you'll find.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,434
Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

18
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:55,980
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,900
The timing is just not right.

20
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:01,337
The economy's bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff.

21
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:02,761
Yeah, I guess you're right.

22
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,137
Here's an idea.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,620
What if we hire an intern?

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,049
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

25
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,196
She?

26
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:14,800
Yeah, you know, a recent graduate, she could give me a hand with some of these projects, and we could keep our costs down.

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,883
That sounds reasonable.

28
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,361
Let me see what I can do.

29
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:28,369
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

30
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,847
Okay, great.

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,537
Let's meet her.

32
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,148
Hi, I'm Adam.

33
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:35,990
Oh, hi.

34
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:36,986
I'm Tony.

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,870
And we're back.

36
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:42,803
Tony.

37
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,700
He's surprised, ha?

38
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,900
Yeah, he's, uh, I don't know why, though, he's surprised.

39
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,040
I think we should talk about that a little bit later.

40
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:55,009
Yes, for now, let's look at some interesting vocabulary and phrases here.

41
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:57,200
Marco, I know you've chosen one for us.

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,960
Yeah, the first one that I want to take a look at is resources.

43
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,632
Resources.

44
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,045
Resources.

45
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:05,401
Resources.

46
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,617
And that means, in this text, basically money.

47
00:02:09,093 --> 00:02:09,320
Right.

48
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,479
So the office doesn't have enough money.

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,331
Okay.

50
00:02:12,857 --> 00:02:17,720
Okay, I've chosen another interesting word for you, and that's understaffed.

51
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:18,933
Understaffed.

52
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,420
Understaffed.

53
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,687
Understaffed.

54
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:28,300
Now, understaffed means that they don't have enough people working there.

55
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:30,270
They don't have enough workers.

56
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,521
Right, they don't have enough employees.

57
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:33,379
Perfect.

58
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:34,011
Okay.

59
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:38,080
Um, the next one is timing is just not right.

60
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,346
The timing is just not right.

61
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:43,249
The timing is just not right.

62
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,300
The timing is just not right.

63
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:55,664
Okay, let's listen to how we can use this entire phrase in a different situation so then we can understand what it means.

64
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:56,360
Let's listen.

65
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,900
I was going to sell my house, but the timing is just not right.

66
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,960
Honey, I think we should have a baby.

67
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,060
The timing is just not right.

68
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:20,784
Okay, great.

69
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,742
I guess that makes it, uh, clear.

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,813
Yes, actually it's very obvious that it means that it's just not a good time.

71
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:28,415
Right.

72
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,276
Perfect.

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,681
I have another interesting phrase for you, which is weight off my shoulders.

74
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,579
Weight off my shoulders.

75
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,860
Weight off my shoulders.

76
00:03:39,005 --> 00:03:40,693
Weight off my shoulders.

77
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:50,320
So to take weight off my shoulders is another way of saying to help me with my work or to take some of my work away from me.

78
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:57,580
If you have a lot of things to do and I come and help you, that means that I took some of the weight off your shoulders.

79
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:58,327
Yes.

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,980
Let's look at the next, uh, phrase that we have here and it's give me a hand.

81
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,415
Give me a hand.

82
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,160
Give me a hand.

83
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,546
Give me a hand.

84
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:09,700
Okay, now this is not literal.

85
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,560
It's not that I'm going to give you somebody's hand, right?

86
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:19,017
Let's listen to some examples and then we can come back and explain what it means.

87
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:28,118
Can you give me a hand with these boxes?

88
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:38,609
Neil, I'll need you to give me a hand with the sales reports.

89
00:04:44,476 --> 00:04:46,262
Here, let me give you a hand with your suitcase.

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,841
All right.

91
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:57,580
Give me a hand is another way of saying help or to help out.

92
00:04:58,186 --> 00:04:59,740
To help out.

93
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,133
Right.

94
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,740
Perfect.

95
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:07,455
Now the last phrase we're going to look at here in this dialogue is keep our costs down.

96
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,161
Keep our costs down.

97
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,596
Keep our costs down.

98
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:14,049
Keep our costs down.

99
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:20,662
So to keep our costs down means to try and not spend so much money.

100
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:27,127
Exactly, many companies, for example, now, uh, control how much printing you do.

101
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:28,160
Yes.

102
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,072
To keep the costs down of paper.

103
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:30,891
Yes.

104
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:36,137
So in other words, they do not want to have unnecessary spending.

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,184
Perfect.

106
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:37,958
Okay.

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:51,470
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one more time, but I want everyone to listen and see why Tony is surprised at the end when he meets his intern, when he meets his assistant.

108
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:06,704
Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

109
00:06:07,017 --> 00:06:10,020
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.

110
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:11,893
The timing is just not right.

111
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,360
The economy is bad and it's too risky to take on new staff.

112
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:16,760
Yeah, I guess you're right.

113
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,114
Here's an idea.

114
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,569
What if we hire an intern?

115
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:22,049
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

116
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,173
She?

117
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,800
You know, a recent graduate, she could give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down.

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,849
That sounds reasonable.

120
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:32,340
Let me see what I can do.

121
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:42,331
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

122
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:43,280
Okay.

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,798
Great.

124
00:06:43,908 --> 00:06:44,540
Let's meet her.

125
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,560
Hi.

126
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,133
I'm Adam.

127
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, hi.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,028
I'm Tony.

129
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,980
Well, you know, Marco, I think that Tony was really surprised because he was kind of hoping to have a female intern.

130
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,005
Yeah, I think that's exactly what he was expecting.

131
00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:09,241
Maybe this guy is a little bit sexist.

132
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,295
He thought that an intern should be a girl, but instead he was surprised.

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,240
Instead he got Adam.

134
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:14,880
Hehe.

135
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Exactly.

136
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,780
And it looks like Adam is really big and really tall because he's got that deep voice.

137
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:21,649
Right.

138
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:25,291
An intern, Marco, do you want to elaborate on that?

139
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:37,184
Working at a company, uh, with a very low salary or sometimes no salary at all, but what you're gaining is experience and you're, uh, learning a lot of things.

140
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:46,883
Everyone who has been an intern or had an intern knows that sometimes, uh, they are not treated all that well.

141
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,843
Sometimes they just serve coffee or they have to do paperwork.

142
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,834
Or like photocopying things and... Exactly.

143
00:07:55,036 --> 00:07:55,344
Yeah.

144
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,470
But some internships are really, really cool and some are really good experiences for, uh, learning.

145
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,173
Yes, definitely.

146
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:14,937
Um, actually, I, I know a friend of mine, she used to work as an intern in one of those really big companies and she told me that she has gained so much experience doing that.

147
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah, I mean, even if you don't get paid, the experience that you get is really good and that just opens doors for maybe getting another job or sometimes the interns get hired by the company to stay because they do such a good job.

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,257
Yeah, I think that's so mostly the case, huh?

149
00:08:33,619 --> 00:08:39,580
Yeah, that happened to me once I started working as an intern and after three months I was hired by the company.

150
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:41,409
So it does happen.

151
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,914
So you did a good job.

152
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:44,449
Uh, yeah, of course.

153
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
Hehehehe!

154
00:08:45,961 --> 00:08:47,860
All right, folks, we're out of time today.

155
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:55,620
I hope that you enjoyed our lesson and we'll be back tomorrow with another really cool and really interesting lesson from EnglishPod.

156
00:08:55,878 --> 00:09:06,544
Don't forget to come to our website at EnglishPod.com where you'll find some really great and interesting resources to help you learn and improve your English even more.

157
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:18,087
Yes, you should definitely do that and Marco and I would love to receive your comments and suggestions that you can leave on our community forum.

158
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,049
But for now, it's time for us to say bye. Bye.r
