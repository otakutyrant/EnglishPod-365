00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, Amira.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How are you today?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm doing great.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What about you?

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm doing pretty good.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm excited about this lesson that you have for us today.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes, it's actually a very, very useful lesson.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's about someone asking his boss for an assistant.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, okay, an assistant.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's an assistant?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, it's someone who helps you with your work around the office.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, great.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's listen to this dialogue, and when we come back, we'll take a look at all the interesting and useful vocabulary that you'll find.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The timing is just not right.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The economy's bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Here's an idea.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What if we hire an intern?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
She?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, you know, a recent graduate, she could give me a hand with some of these projects, and we could keep our costs down.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That sounds reasonable.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let me see what I can do.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, great.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's meet her.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hi, I'm Adam.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, hi.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm Tony.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And we're back.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tony.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's surprised, huh?

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, he's, uh, I don't know why, though, he's surprised.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think we should talk about that a little bit later.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, for now, let's look at some interesting vocabulary and phrases here.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Marco, I know you've chosen one for us.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, the first one that I want to take a look at is resources.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Resources.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Resources.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And that means, in this text, basically money.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Right.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So the office doesn't have enough money.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, I've chosen another interesting word for you, and that's understaffed.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Understaffed.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Understaffed.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Understaffed.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, understaffed means that they don't have enough people working there.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They don't have enough workers.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right, they don't have enough employees.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Perfect.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The next one is timing is just not right.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The timing is just not right.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The timing is just not right.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The timing is just not right.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, let's listen to how we can use this entire phrase in a different situation so then we can understand what it means.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's listen.

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was going to sell my house, but the timing is just not right.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Honey, I think we should have a baby.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The timing is just not right.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, great.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I guess that makes it clear.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, actually it's very obvious that it means that it's just not a good time.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Right.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Perfect.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have another interesting phrase for you, which is weight off my shoulders.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Weight off my shoulders.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Weight off my shoulders.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Weight off my shoulders.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So to take weight off my shoulders is another way of saying to help me with my work or to take some of my work away from me.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you have a lot of things to do and I come and help you, that means that I took some of the weight off your shoulders.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's look at the next phrase that we have here and it's give me a hand.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Give me a hand.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Give me a hand.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Give me a hand.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, now this is not literal.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not that I'm going to give you somebody's hand, right?

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's listen to some examples and then we can come back and explain what it means.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Can you give me a hand with these boxes?

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Neil, I'll need you to give me a hand with the sales reports.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Here, let me give you a hand with your suitcase.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
All right.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Give me a hand is another way of saying help or to help out.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
To help out.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Perfect.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now the last phrase we're going to look at here in this dialogue is keep our costs down.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Keep our costs down.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Keep our costs down.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Keep our costs down.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So to keep our costs down means to try and not spend so much money.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Many companies, for example, now control how much printing you do.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
To keep the costs down of paper.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So in other words, they do not want to have unnecessary spending.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Perfect.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one more time, but I want everyone to listen and see why Tony is surprised at the end when he meets his intern, when he meets his assistant.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The timing is just not right.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The economy is bad and it's too risky to take on new staff.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yeah, I guess you're right.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here's an idea.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What if we hire an intern?

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
She?

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You know, a recent graduate, she could give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down.

118
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That sounds reasonable.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let me see what I can do.

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Great.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's meet her.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hi.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm Adam.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, hi.

127
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm Tony.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, you know, Marco, I think that Tony was really surprised because he was kind of hoping to have a female intern.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, I think that's exactly what he was expecting.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Maybe this guy is a little bit sexist.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He thought that an intern should be a girl, but instead he was surprised.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Instead he got Adam.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Exactly.

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And it looks like Adam is really big and really tall because he's got that deep voice.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
An intern, Marco, do you want to elaborate on that?

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Working at a company with a very low salary or sometimes no salary at all, but what you're gaining is experience and you're learning a lot of things.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Everyone who has been an intern or had an intern knows that sometimes they are not treated all that well.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Sometimes they just serve coffee or they have to do paperwork.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Or like photocopying things.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But some internships are really, really cool and some are really good experiences for learning.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, definitely.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Actually, I know a friend of mine, she used to work as an intern in one of those really big companies and she told me that she has gained so much experience doing that.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, I mean, even if you don't get paid, the experience that you get is really good and that just opens doors for maybe getting another job or sometimes the interns get hired by the company to stay because they do such a good job.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, I think that's mostly the case, huh?

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yeah, that happened to me once I started working as an intern and after three months I was hired by the company.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it does happen.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you did a good job.

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, of course.

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All right, folks, we're out of time today.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I hope that you enjoyed our lesson and we'll be back tomorrow with another really cool and really interesting lesson from EnglishPod.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't forget to come to our website at EnglishPod.com where you'll find some really great and interesting resources to help you learn and improve your English even more.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes, you should definitely do that and Marco and I would love to receive your comments and suggestions that you can leave on our community forum.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But for now, it's time for us to say bye.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Bye.
