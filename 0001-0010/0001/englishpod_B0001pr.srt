00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,843
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,385
And Amira and I are here today with a great, great lesson for you.

5
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:15,345
Yes, we are.

6
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:18,494
Today we're going to be talking about a restaurant.

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,396
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more details?

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:29,243
Well we're talking about a situation in a restaurant and two people are involved, the waiter and the customer.

9
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:31,000
And I don't want to say any more.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,581
Okay, don't say any more.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,578
Let's just listen to this dialogue and we'll be back later to explain it.

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,338
Good evening.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,501
My name is Fabio.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,905
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,149
May I take your order?

16
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,418
No, I'm still working on it.

17
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:53,447
This menu is not even in English.

18
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:54,661
What's good here?

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
For you sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

20
00:01:00,654 --> 00:01:02,414
Does it come with coke and fries?

21
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:09,381
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

22
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,000
Excellent choice.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,680
Your order will be ready soon.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,658
How soon is soon?

26
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:23,461
Twenty minutes.

27
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:24,901
You know what?

28
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:26,858
I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

29
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:36,189
Uh oh, what a waiter.

30
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,065
What a waiter.

31
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,730
He is really angry at this customer and I can't blame him.

32
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,000
I would be angry too.

33
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:44,887
Yeah.

34
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:50,800
So I think Marco, you have chosen some interesting expressions for us here.

35
00:01:51,316 --> 00:01:52,269
What is the first one?

36
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:56,203
Well, the first one is I'm still working on it.

37
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,203
I'm still working on it.

38
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,603
I'm still working on it.

39
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,436
I'm still working on it.

40
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:09,047
Why don't we listen to some other examples on how you can use this word and then we'll come back and explain it.

41
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,141
Did you finish reading the magazine?

42
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:18,930
I'm still working on it.

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,643
Did you fix my car?

44
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,440
I'm still working on it.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,585
Ah, so you could say I'm still working on it means I still need more time.

46
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,698
Fantastic.

47
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:41,930
Great. Okay.

48
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,700
It's clear.

49
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:44,320
I have another one for you guys.

50
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,123
It's a phrase commonly used and you'll hear it all the time.

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,989
Coke and fries.

52
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,400
Coke and fries.

53
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a short way of saying Coca Cola and French fries.

54
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:01,461
So that's basically America's fast food.

55
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:02,167
Yeah.

56
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,840
Burger, Coke and fries.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,414
Okay.

58
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,509
What's next on the menu?

59
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,414
On the menu we have a complimentary glass of wine.

60
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:15,621
Complimentary glass of wine.

61
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,734
Complimentary means that it's free.

62
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,170
Free.

63
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:19,607
Yes.

64
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,603
We love that, huh?

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,040
Yeah.

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,901
We definitely like free things.

67
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,920
Well, um, I have another one for us here.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,563
Another interesting phrase.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,138
I'll go with.

70
00:03:30,436 --> 00:03:33,265
I'll go with.

71
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,690
So basically it's another way of saying I'm choosing.

72
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,830
Yeah, I'll choose or I'll take.

73
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,483
I'll take.

74
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:40,800
Okay.

75
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:41,527
Very good.

76
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:42,167
All right.

77
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:49,760
The next word that I want to take a look at is grab, grab, grab, grab.

78
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,661
Okay.

79
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:59,185
Now let's listen to some other examples of how we could use grab in different situations and then we'll come back and explain it.

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,330
On your way home.

81
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:07,956
Can you grab some milk?

82
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,512
Wait for me please.

83
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:12,967
I need to grab my coat.

84
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:18,501
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

85
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:24,858
All right.

86
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:29,490
Well I would understand that go grab means go get quickly.

87
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:30,756
To go get quickly.

88
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.
To go get quickly.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,512
Yeah.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,763
All right everyone.

91
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:42,000
So now it's time to listen one more time to the dialogue and listen carefully and try to understand why the waiter doesn't like the customer.

92
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's listen.

93
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:51,454
Good evening.

94
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,792
My name is Fabio.

95
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

96
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,265
May I take your order?

97
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,549
No, I'm still working on it.

98
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,570
This menu is not even in English.

99
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:00,843
What's good here?

100
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:06,145
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

101
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,552
Does it come with Coke and fries?

102
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:15,454
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

103
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:21,156
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

104
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,069
Excellent choice.

105
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,720
Your order will be ready soon.

106
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,629
How soon is soon?

107
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,592
20 minutes.

108
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:30,974
You know what?

109
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

110
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,000
<Spanish, it should be the waiter's angry word at the customer.>

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,080
<Spanish, it should be the waiter's angry word at the customer.>
<Spanish, it should be the waiter's angry word at the customer.>

112
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,512
<Spanish, it should be the waiter's angry word at the customer.>

113
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:45,490
Marco, why did this waiter get angry at the customer?

114
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:49,163
Well, he basically wasted the waiter's time.

115
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,810
I mean, this guy comes into the restaurant.

116
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:57,032
He is not very polite and he's asking all these questions.

117
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,247
In the end, he just gets up and says, I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

118
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:07,425
Yeah, and I also think that this guy was a lot more casual than the place he was in, right?

119
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,210
Yeah.

120
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,000
I think this was a nice, fancy restaurant.

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,490
So I think he was in the wrong place.

122
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

123
00:06:14,152 --> 00:06:19,000
So how many times, Marco, tell me, do you really have fast food a week?

124
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,550
Fast food?

125
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:21,367
Let's see.

126
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:22,385
Uhhh.

127
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:25,000
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,850
No, I'm just kidding.

129
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:27,403
No, no.

130
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:32,340
I think I get fast food maybe once a week, once or twice a week.

131
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:32,865
All right.

132
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,829
Talking about fast food made me hungry.

133
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,723
So I think I'm going to go grab something to eat myself.

134
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:38,538
Yeah, me too.

135
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,374
All right.

136
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,636
I hope you guys enjoyed the lesson today.

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:47,000
And remember that all of this vocabulary is useful for your everyday needs.

138
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:47,694
Yes.

Bye.
