00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And Amira and I are here today with a great, great lesson for you.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes, we are.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we're going to be talking about a restaurant.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more details?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well we're talking about a situation in a restaurant and two people are involved, the waiter and the customer.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And I don't want to say any more.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, don't say any more.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's just listen to this dialogue and we'll be back later to explain it.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Good evening.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Fabio.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
May I take your order?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, I'm still working on it.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This menu is not even in English.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's good here?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For you sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Does it come with coke and fries?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Excellent choice.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Your order will be ready soon.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How soon is soon?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Twenty minutes.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You know what?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Uh oh, what a waiter.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What a waiter.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He is really angry at this customer and I can't blame him.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I would be angry too.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I think Marco, you have chosen some interesting expressions for us here.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What is the first one?

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, the first one is I'm still working on it.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm still working on it.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm still working on it.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm still working on it.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why don't we listen to some other examples on how you can use this word and then we'll come back and explain it.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Did you finish reading the magazine?

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm still working on it.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Did you fix my car?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm still working on it.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah, so you could say I'm still working on it means I still need more time.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Fantastic.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Great.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's clear.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have another one for you guys.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a phrase commonly used and you'll hear it all the time.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Coke and fries.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Coke and fries.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Coke and fries.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a short way of saying Coca Cola and French fries.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So that's basically America's fast food.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Burger, Coke and fries.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's next on the menu?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
On the menu we have a complimentary glass of wine.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Complimentary glass of wine.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Complimentary glass of wine.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Complimentary means that it's free.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Free.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We love that, huh?

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We definitely like free things.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, um, I have another one for us here.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Another interesting phrase.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll go with.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll go with.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll go with.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll go with.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So basically it's another way of saying I'm choosing.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, I'll choose or I'll take.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll take.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Very good.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The next word that I want to take a look at is grab, grab, grab, grab.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now let's listen to some other examples of how we could use grab in different situations and then we'll come back and explain it.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
On your way home.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can you grab some milk?

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait for me please.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I need to grab my coat.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well I would understand that go grab means go get quickly.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
To go get quickly.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right everyone.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So now it's time to listen one more time to the dialogue and listen carefully and try to understand why the waiter doesn't like the customer.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's listen.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Good evening.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My name is Fabio.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
May I take your order?

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, I'm still working on it.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This menu is not even in English.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What's good here?

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
For you, sir, I would recommend spaghetti and meatballs.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Does it come with Coke and fries?

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It comes with either soup or salad and a complimentary glass of wine, sir.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll go with the spaghetti and meatballs, salad and the wine.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Excellent choice.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your order will be ready soon.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How soon is soon?

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
20 minutes.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know what?

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll go.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll be your waiter for tonight.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Marco, why did this waiter get angry at the customer?

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, he basically wasted the waiter's time.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I mean, this guy comes into the restaurant.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He is not very polite and he's asking all these questions.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In the end, he just gets up and says, I'll just go grab a burger across the street.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, and I also think that this guy was a lot more casual than the place he was in, right?

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think this was a nice, fancy restaurant.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So I think he was in the wrong place.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So how many times, Marco, tell me, do you really have fast food a week?

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Fast food?

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's see.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, I'm just kidding.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, no.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think I get fast food maybe once a week, once or twice a week.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
All right.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Talking about fast food made me hungry.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I think I'm going to go grab something to eat myself.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, me too.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I hope you guys enjoyed the lesson today.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And remember that all of this vocabulary is useful for your everyday needs.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000

So until then, bye.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Bye.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Bye.
