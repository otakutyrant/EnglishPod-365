00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Erica, today we are really excited, right?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah, we've got a great lesson today all about real English.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Exactly, English that you hear in movies and TV shows.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, speaking of movies, today's podcast takes place at the movies.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Exactly, and that's why it's so fun today.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, great, so before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
In today's vocabulary preview, we have two words.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And the first word is inconsiderate.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Inconsiderate.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Inconsiderate.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, Erica, what is it when someone is inconsiderate?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If someone's inconsiderate, they're not thinking about the feelings of other people.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Right, so for example, yesterday I was on the subway and it was full.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Right.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And an old lady was standing there and no one got up to give her their seat.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That was pretty inconsiderate.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Great, so now let's take a look at our second word and it's keep it down.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Keep it down.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Keep it down.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Keep it down.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So why don't we listen to some examples on how we use keep it down so we can understand.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Example one.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Excuse me, do you mind keeping it down?

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's after midnight.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, sorry.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Example two.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm trying to study.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you mind keeping it down?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Example three.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Do you mind keeping it down?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm trying to watch the game.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So that means be quiet.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, don't make so much noise.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I used to hear this one all the time from my mother.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I think we all did when we were children.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's gonna be kind of fast.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But don't worry about it if you can't understand everything.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
By the end of today's lesson, you will understand this dialogue.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's so inconsiderate.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't worry about it, it's not such a big deal.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, I can't hear a thing.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Excuse me, can you keep it down?

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sure, sorry about that.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Someone's phone is ringing.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Honey, I think it's your phone.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Did you forget to switch it off?

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh no, you're right.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's so embarrassing.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you mind keeping it down?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I hate it when people's phones ring when I'm watching a movie.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think everyone gets kind of angry, but we're gonna talk about this a little bit later.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why don't we take a look now at our language takeaway?

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Language takeaway.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So the language takeaway is our most important words for today's lesson.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And our first word today is not such a big deal.

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Not such a big deal.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Not such a big deal.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So when something is not a big deal, it's...

66
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Not a big problem.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not important, right?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Exactly.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, let's listen to some examples.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Example one.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't get these files to you by tomorrow.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's okay, it's not such a big deal.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Example two.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm really sorry.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm gonna be ten minutes late for the meeting.

76
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not such a big deal.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Peter and Liam are late too.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Example three.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now let's look at our second word.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And it's switch it off.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Switch it off.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Switch it off.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Switch it off.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So this word means to turn it off.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To turn something off.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now we can use it in three different ways.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, this one is a little bit complicated because it changes a little bit depending on how you use it.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So Marco, I think you've got some examples for us.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right, so for example, I can say, Did you switch off your phone?

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or you could say, Did you switch your phone off?

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right, or simply you can ask, Did you switch it off?

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think this one is a little bit hard.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's look at a couple more examples.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, so I can say, for example, Switch off the TV.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Switch the TV off.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or switch it off.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I think that's a little bit more clear.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But you know what, we even had trouble with that one, didn't we?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, we had to do it a couple of times.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, now let's look at our last word, and it's, Can't hear a thing.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Can't hear a thing.

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't hear a thing.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Can't hear a thing.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, we have some examples for this phrase, so let's listen.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Example one.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What's going on in there?

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know, I can't hear a thing.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Example two.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry, this music is too loud.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can't hear a thing.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So that's like saying, I can't hear.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Exactly, I can't hear anything.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's too loud.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Right, so now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's going to be slower.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This time listen for some of the key words we were explaining.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's so inconsiderate.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't worry about it.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not such a big deal.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can't hear a thing.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Excuse me, can you keep it down?

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sure, sorry about that.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Someone's phone is ringing.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Honey, I think it's your phone.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Did you forget to switch it off?

128
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh no, you're right.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's so embarrassing.

130
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you mind keeping it down?

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, great, now with the dialogue slower it's really understandable.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, I think you could catch those key words a lot better.

134
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Perfect, so now we are ready to look at putting it together.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Putting it together.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So in putting it together we help you use a great phrase in different ways.

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And today's phrase is, do you mind?

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Do you mind?

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you mind?

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, so let's listen to some examples on how you can use this phrase in different situations.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Example one.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you mind holding my coat for me?

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Example two.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, I forgot my wallet.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you mind paying for dinner?

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Example three.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you mind turning off your phone?

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So this phrase is usually pretty polite.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I could say to you, Marco, do you mind holding my coat for me?

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And that's really polite.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, so would you mind, do you mind are very polite phrases.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But depending on your voice and how you use your tone, it could be a little bit sarcastic, right?

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah, it could be a little bit rude if you say, would you mind keeping it down?

154
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Exactly, like we heard in our dialogue.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, so that's not so polite.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I mean, in English, you have to be careful because your tone of voice tells the other person how you're feeling, if you're angry, sad or just like in any other language.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, that's true.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, I mean, using a phrase like do you mind is a great phrase, but make sure you keep a positive tone in your voice.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Exactly.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So now that we've talked about all these great things, we can listen to the dialogue a third time, but it'll be at its normal speed.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's so inconsiderate.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Don't worry about it.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not such a big deal.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, I can't hear a thing.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Excuse me.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Can you keep it down?

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sure.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sorry about that.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Someone's phone is ringing.

172
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Honey, I think it's your phone.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Did you forget to switch it off?

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, no.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're right.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's so embarrassing.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Do you mind keeping it down?

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I know that in different countries there are different habits about watching movies.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, that's definitely true.

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Erika, what's it like in Canada?

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, in Canada it's really common to eat popcorn and candy and maybe chips while you're watching a movie.

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But if your phone rings in the movie theater, this is a big problem.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I imagine it is.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I would be upset also.

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What about in Ecuador?

187
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, in Ecuador and in South America, usually people can bring in food from the outside.

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Really?

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, so it's not really uncommon, depending on the city, to find people bringing in chicken or some sort of really smelly food.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No way.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So you get either really hungry or really upset, but that's what happens.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You know, I used to live in Switzerland, and in Switzerland you would have to eat before you watched the movie.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There was no popcorn, no soda, no candy inside the movie theater.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Can you imagine that?

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I could not live with that because the whole purpose of going to the movies is to have some popcorn and relax and have a good time.

196
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You can't have a movie without popcorn.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, so we've talked a lot about how to ask someone to be quiet today.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I hope that you'll go out and try a few of these phrases in your daily life.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, and I hope also that you visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Marco and I are there every day, so we'll be happy to answer your questions.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But until next time, goodbye.
