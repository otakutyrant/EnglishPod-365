00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,099
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,059
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,599
Erica, today we are really excited, right?

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,859
Yeah, we've got a great lesson today all about real English.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,120
Exactly, English that you hear in movies and TV shows.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,780
Yeah, speaking of movies, today's podcast takes place at the movies.

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,000
Exactly, and that's why it's so fun today.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,620
Uh-huh.

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,719
Okay, great, so before we listen to our dialogue, let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:33,939
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:38,500
In today's vocabulary preview, we have two words.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,520
And the first word is inconsiderate.

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:42,899
Inconsiderate.

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,079
Inconsiderate.

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,359
So, Erica, what is it when someone is inconsiderate?

16
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,079
If someone's inconsiderate, they're not thinking about the feelings of other people.

17
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,000
Right, so for example, yesterday I was on the subway and it was full.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,539
Right.

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,259
And an old lady was standing there and no one got up to give her their seat.

20
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:04,260
That was pretty inconsiderate.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,799
Great, so now let's take a look at our second word and it's keep it down.

22
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:09,859
Keep it down.

23
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,219
Keep it down.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,519
Keep it down.

25
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,200
So why don't we listen to some examples on how we use keep it down so we can understand.

26
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,780
Example one.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,299
Excuse me, do you mind keeping it down?

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,560
It's after midnight.

29
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,659
Okay, sorry.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,780
Example two.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,859
I'm trying to study.

32
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,379
Do you mind keeping it down?

33
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,739
Example three.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,079
Do you mind keeping it down?

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,359
I'm trying to watch the game.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,319
So that means be quiet.

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,079
Yes, don't make so much noise.

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,879
I used to hear this one all the time from my mother.

39
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,439
I think we all did when we were children.

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,379
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

41
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,460
It's gonna be kind of fast.

42
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,580
But don't worry about it if you can't understand everything.

43
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:24,199
By the end of today's lesson, you will understand this dialogue.

44
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,939
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

45
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,759
It's so inconsiderate.

46
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,319
Don't worry about it, it's not such a big deal.

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,860
No, I can't hear a thing.

48
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,039
Excuse me, can you keep it down?

49
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,740
Sure, sorry about that.

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,280
Someone's phone is ringing.

51
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,039
Honey, I think it's your phone.

52
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
Did you forget to switch it off?

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,240
Oh no, you're right.

54
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,500
That's so embarrassing.

55
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,719
Do you mind keeping it down?

56
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,680
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

57
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,659
I hate it when people's phones ring when I'm watching a movie.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,139
I think everyone gets kind of angry, but we're gonna talk about this a little bit later.

59
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,300
Why don't we take a look now at our language takeaway?

60
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,240
Language takeaway.

61
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,599
So the language takeaway is our most important words for today's lesson.

62
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,199
And our first word today is not such a big deal.

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,439
Not such a big deal.

64
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,020
Not such a big deal.

65
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,240
So when something is not a big deal, it's...

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,139
Not a big problem.

67
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,300
It's not important, right?

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,819
Exactly.

69
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,939
Okay, let's listen to some examples.

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Example one.

71
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,620
I can't get these files to you by tomorrow.

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,599
That's okay, it's not such a big deal.

73
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:18,959
Example two.

74
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,439
I'm really sorry.

75
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,779
I'm gonna be ten minutes late for the meeting.

76
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:28,500
It's not such a big deal.

77
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,220
Peter and Liam are late too.

78
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,139
Example three.

79
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,220
Now let's look at our second word.

80
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,379
And it's switch it off.

81
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,480
Switch it off.

82
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,939
Switch it off.

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,360
Switch it off.

84
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,000
So this word means to turn it off.

85
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,240
To turn something off.

86
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,980
Now we can use it in three different ways.

87
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:56,139
Yeah, this one is a little bit complicated because it changes a little bit depending on how you use it.

88
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,660
So Marco, I think you've got some examples for us.

89
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,360
Right, so for example, I can say, Did you switch off your phone?

90
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:06,720
Or you could say, Did you switch your phone off?

91
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,740
Right, or simply you can ask, Did you switch it off?

92
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,060
I think this one is a little bit hard.

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,480
Let's look at a couple more examples.

94
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,860
Okay, so I can say, for example, Switch off the TV.

95
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,680
Switch the TV off.

96
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:23,319
Or switch it off.

97
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,300
Yeah, I think that's a little bit more clear.

98
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,339
But you know what, we even had trouble with that one, didn't we?

99
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,980
Yeah, we had to do it a couple of times.

100
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,379
Okay, now let's look at our last word, and it's, Can't hear a thing.

101
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:37,939
Can't hear a thing.

102
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,680
I can't hear a thing.

103
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,019
Can't hear a thing.

104
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:44,500
Okay, we have some examples for this phrase, so let's listen.

105
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
Example one.

106
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,500
What's going on in there?

107
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,379
I don't know, I can't hear a thing.

108
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,199
Example two.

109
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:00,939
What?

110
00:06:01,459 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm sorry, this music is too loud.

111
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
I can't hear a thing.

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,199
So that's like saying, I can't hear.

113
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,279
Exactly, I can't hear anything.

114
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,220
It's too loud.

115
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,860
Right, so now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,079
It's going to be slower.

117
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,519
This time listen for some of the key words we were explaining.

118
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,740
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

119
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,259
It's so inconsiderate.

120
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,759
Don't worry about it.

121
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,540
It's not such a big deal.

122
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
I can't hear a thing.

123
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,759
Excuse me, can you keep it down?

124
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,819
Sure, sorry about that.

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,600
Someone's phone is ringing.

126
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,180
Honey, I think it's your phone.

127
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,600
Did you forget to switch it off?

128
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,720
Oh no, you're right.

129
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,540
That's so embarrassing.

130
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,019
Do you mind keeping it down?

131
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,959
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

132
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,259
Okay, great, now with the dialogue slower it's really understandable.

133
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,920
Yeah, I think you could catch those key words a lot better.

134
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,899
Perfect, so now we are ready to look at putting it together.

135
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,100
Putting it together.

136
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,420
So in putting it together we help you use a great phrase in different ways.

137
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:32,980
And today's phrase is, do you mind?

138
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,319
Do you mind?

139
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,379
Do you mind?

140
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:41,740
Okay, so let's listen to some examples on how you can use this phrase in different situations.

141
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,480
Example one.

142
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,680
Do you mind holding my coat for me?

143
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,819
Example two.

144
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,779
Oh, I forgot my wallet.

145
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,040
Do you mind paying for dinner?

146
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,420
Example three.

147
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,800
Do you mind turning off your phone?

148
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,819
So this phrase is usually pretty polite.

149
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:20,819
I could say to you, Marco, do you mind holding my coat for me?

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,779
And that's really polite.

151
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,300
Yeah, so would you mind, do you mind are very polite phrases.

152
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,759
But depending on your voice and how you use your tone, it could be a little bit sarcastic, right?

153
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:36,500
Yeah, it could be a little bit rude if you say, would you mind keeping it down?

154
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,639
Exactly, like we heard in our dialogue.

155
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,460
Yeah, so that's not so polite.

156
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,419
Yeah, exactly.

157
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:49,919
I mean, in English, you have to be careful because your tone of voice tells the other person how you're feeling, if you're angry, sad or just like in any other language.

158
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,799
Yeah, that's true.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,139
So, I mean, using a phrase like do you mind is a great phrase, but make sure you keep a positive tone in your voice.

160
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,080
Exactly.

161
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,740
So now that we've talked about all these great things, we can listen to the dialogue a third time, but it'll be at its normal speed.

162
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,519
Those people in front of us are making so much noise.

163
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,299
It's so inconsiderate.

164
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't worry about it.

165
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,860
It's not such a big deal.

166
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,379
Oh, I can't hear a thing.

167
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,539
Excuse me.

168
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,580
Can you keep it down?

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,799
Sure.

170
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,440
Sorry about that.

171
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,840
Someone's phone is ringing.

172
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:45,600
Honey, I think it's your phone.

173
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,100
Did you forget to switch it off?

174
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,519
Oh, no.

175
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:51,759
You're right.

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,039
That's so embarrassing.

177
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,259
Do you mind keeping it down?

178
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,899
I'm trying to watch a movie here.

179
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:08,259
So I know that in different countries there are different habits about watching movies.

180
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,940
Yeah, that's definitely true.

181
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,419
Erika, what's it like in Canada?

182
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,480
Well, in Canada it's really common to eat popcorn and candy and maybe chips while you're watching a movie.

183
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,059
But if your phone rings in the movie theater, this is a big problem.

184
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:25,279
I imagine it is.

185
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,980
I would be upset also.

186
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,000
What about in Ecuador?

187
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,860
Well, in Ecuador and in South America, usually people can bring in food from the outside.

188
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:35,320
Really?

189
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah, so it's not really uncommon, depending on the city, to find people bringing in chicken or some sort of really smelly food.

190
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,080
No way.

191
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,120
So you get either really hungry or really upset, but that's what happens.

192
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,159
You know, I used to live in Switzerland, and in Switzerland you would have to eat before you watched the movie.

193
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,740
There was no popcorn, no soda, no candy inside the movie theater.

194
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:00,740
Can you imagine that?

195
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:07,759
I could not live with that because the whole purpose of going to the movies is to have some popcorn and relax and have a good time.

196
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,519
You can't have a movie without popcorn.

197
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,200
Okay, so we've talked a lot about how to ask someone to be quiet today.

198
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,059
And I hope that you'll go out and try a few of these phrases in your daily life.

199
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:26,059
Yes, and I hope also that you visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

200
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,700
Marco and I are there every day, so we'll be happy to answer your questions.

201
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,379
But until next time, goodbye.
