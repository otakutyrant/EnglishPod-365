00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:03,919
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,919
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,000
How are you, Erika?

5
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:08,320
Marco, I'm doing really well.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,839
How about you?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,679
I'm doing great.

8
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,560
I'm really excited because today we're talking about travel.

9
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:13,419
That's right.

10
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,399
We're going to give you some real English to talk about travel.

11
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:18,140
Exactly.

12
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,859
English that you would use in everyday life that you hear in movies and TV shows.

13
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,579
English people actually use.

14
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,359
Exactly.

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
So why don't you tell us a little bit about this lesson for today?

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,899
OK, so today we are going to listen as a husband and wife get ready to go on a trip.

17
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:36,340
All right.

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,039
That sounds a little bit complicated.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,700
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,219
Well, let's look at our two preview words.

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,380
Vocabulary Preview.

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,340
OK, so the first word that we have is road trip.

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,359
Road trip.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,560
Road trip.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,439
Road trip.

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,259
OK, so road trips are really fun and interesting, right?

27
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,759
Road trips are great.

28
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,960
You get to get in a car with your family and drive on a vacation.

29
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:04,239
Yeah, those are really fun and they're really popular in North America.

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,000
Really popular.

31
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,420
I've been on a million road trips.

32
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,719
All right, we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

33
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,760
But now let's take a look at our second word and it's the cars packed.

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,239
The cars packed.

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,000
The cars packed.

36
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,819
The car is packed.

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,099
So when your car is packed, it means that?

38
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,040
Everything you need is inside the car.

39
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,579
All right, so your bags, your food, everything that you need for your trip.

40
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,000
Perfect.

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,620
OK, so those were our two preview words and now we are ready to listen to the dialogue for the first time.

42
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,780
OK, this dialogue will be at normal speed.

43
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,840
It will be fast, but don't worry if you don't understand everything.

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
After 10 minutes, we promise you will understand everything in this lesson.

45
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,459
So are we all ready to go?

46
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:02,780
Yep, I think so.

47
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,659
The car is packed.

48
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,959
We have munchies and music and the maps in the car.

49
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,060
Did you get the camera?

50
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,000
Got it.

51
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,099
Did you fill up the tank?

52
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:10,520
Yep, it's all set.

53
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,379
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

54
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm sure.

55
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,620
We've got all our bases covered.

56
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,819
Well, let's get going then.

57
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,280
I love road trips.

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,340
Yes.

59
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,460
Do you think we can make a pit stop?

60
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:39,680
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

61
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,180
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

62
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,919
Well, she forgot to go to the bathroom.

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,800
Yeah, I hate it when this happens.

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,360
This happens to me on almost every road trip.

65
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:57,860
OK, great.

66
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:00,180
So now it's time for our language takeaway.

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,120
We have three words for our language takeaway today.

68
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:05,620
Language takeaway.

69
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,919
And the first word is munchies.

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,000
Munchies.

71
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,879
Munchies.

72
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,159
So munchies are the words that we use in our language takeaway.

73
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,620
Munchies are?

74
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:14,520
Snacks.

75
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,080
Snacks.

76
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:15,419
Food.

77
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,039
Food.

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,699
Chips.

79
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:17,699
Chips.

80
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:18,319
Cookies.

81
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:19,960
Chocolate bars.

82
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,340
All that good stuff.

83
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,580
I love munchies.

84
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,419
And they're really good when you're taking a road trip.

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,180
Indeed.

86
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,680
OK, so let's take a look at our second language takeaway word for today.

87
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,120
And it is fill up the tank.

88
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,460
Fill up the tank.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,259
Fill up the tank.

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
Fill up the tank.

91
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,120
So this is to?

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,460
Put gas in your car.

93
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,620
Put gas in the gas tank.

94
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,479
Put gas in the gas tank.

95
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:43,960
Exactly.

96
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,099
All right, our last language takeaway today is?

97
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:48,740
Pit stop.

98
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:49,960
Pit stop.

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,919
Pit stop.

100
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:52,360
Make a pit stop.

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,479
It's a quick stop for you to get some gas, food, go to the bathroom.

102
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,879
Yeah, a pit stop.

103
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,900
A quick stop.

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,620
Great.

105
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,620
So now it's time for putting it together.

106
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,840
Putting it together.

107
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,099
OK, so we have two great phrases for you today.

108
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,620
Let's take a look at the first one.

109
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,719
We've got all our bases covered.

110
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,339
We've got all our bases covered.

111
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,560
We've got all our bases covered.

112
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,639
This is a really great phrase and it's really useful, right?

113
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,939
Yeah, let's listen to a couple of examples.

114
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,839
Example one.

115
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,699
We've got all our bases covered in case the hurricane hits.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,060
Example two.

117
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:44,120
OK, I have my keys, wallet and passport.

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,100
Looks like I have all my bases covered.

119
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,740
OK, it's clear now, but you can use this in a lot of different situations, right?

120
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,180
You can use this in many situations.

121
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,540
If I'm at work, I could say, all right, we've got a really good marketing plan.

122
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,939
We've got all our bases covered.

123
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:04,839
Exactly.

124
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,000
You have everything ready.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,639
You're all prepared.

126
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,420
Perfect.

127
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,060
All right.

128
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,639
Now let's take a look at our second phrase and it's, let's get going.

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,879
Let's get going.

130
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,399
Let's get going.

131
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,240
Let's get going.

132
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:21,139
All right, so when you say, let's get going, it just means?

133
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,160
Let's start.

134
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,720
Let's start.

135
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,120
Let's go.

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,540
Yeah.

137
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,319
OK, but the interesting thing about this phrase is you can change it a little bit and it means something different.

138
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,120
Let's listen to a couple of examples.

139
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,899
Example one.

140
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,939
I have the chicken, so let's get cooking.

141
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Example two.

142
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,300
This house is really scary.

143
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,720
Let's get out of here.

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Example three.

145
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,000
I have another meeting in 20 minutes, so let's get down to business.

146
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,779
So let's get down to business, Marco.

147
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,740
Let's get down to business.

148
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,160
Let's listen to the dialogue one more time, but this time?

149
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,379
It'll be a little bit slower and you'll understand much better.

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,839
So are we all ready to go?

151
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Yep, I think so.

152
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,980
The car's packed.

153
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,120
We have munchies and music and the map's in the car.

154
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,879
Did you get the camera?

155
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,199
Got it.

156
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,620
Did you fill up the tank?

157
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,560
Yep, it's all set.

158
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,180
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

159
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,660
I'm sure.

160
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,040
We've got all our bases covered.

161
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,500
Well, let's get going then.

162
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,459
I love road trips.

163
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,879
Um, do you think we can make a pit stop?

164
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,480
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

165
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,300
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

166
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,139
So that was a little more clear this time, wasn't it?

167
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,620
Yeah, you can definitely understand better about what we've been talking about.

168
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:03,000
Yep.

169
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,480
Okay, so now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

170
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,720
Erica, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

171
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:18,180
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great useful phrases to help you express your ideas clearly.

172
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,360
Okay, great.

173
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,459
So let's look at Fluency Builder.

174
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:23,459
Fluency Builder.

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,439
All right, so we all know how to ask the question.

176
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:29,899
Are we ready to go?

177
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,639
That's right, you can say, can we go now?

178
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,319
Or you can say, are we ready to go?

179
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:36,160
Exactly.

180
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,160
But there's another way that we can say this, and we heard it in our dialogue.

181
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,699
So let's listen.

182
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,079
So, are we all ready to go?

183
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,100
So, are we all ready to go?

184
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,120
Wow, that sounds really good.

185
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,399
It sounds a lot more fluent.

186
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:55,540
Fluent, exactly.

187
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,720
Okay, so another simple phrase that we all know how to say is, it is ready.

188
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,100
It is prepared.

189
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,259
It is ready.

190
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:04,879
Right.

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,660
So these examples are fine, they're right.

192
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,720
Yeah, they're correct English, no problem.

193
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,480
But there's another way to say this that we heard in the dialogue, and it sounds a lot more fluent.

194
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,759
Yep, it's all set.

195
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,600
Yep, it's all set.

196
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,899
It's all set, that sounds much better.

197
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes, and we're all set to listen to this dialogue for a third time, and this time it's going to be at its normal speed.

198
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,740
So, are we all ready to go?

199
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,100
Yep, I think so.

200
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,299
The car's packed, we have munchies and music, and the map's in the car.

201
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,379
Did you get the camera?

202
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,320
Got it.

203
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,440
Did you fill up the tank?

204
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,860
Yep, it's all set.

205
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,100
I'm sure.

207
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,980
We've got all our bases covered.

208
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,139
Well, let's get going then.

209
00:08:57,299 --> 00:08:58,720
I love road trips.

210
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,779
Do you think we can make a pit stop?

211
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,019
But we've only been on the road for ten minutes.

212
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,500
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

213
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,860
So Erica, you said you've been on a million road trips.

214
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,740
What was that all about?

215
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:30,559
Where have you been?

216
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,980
Okay, well maybe not a million road trips, but many road trips.

217
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:46,460
Every summer I used to go on a road trip with my family, and we would drive many, many hours, probably eight hours in one day, up to northern Canada.

218
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,759
Oh wow, nice.

219
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,919
Yeah, and then we would go camping, and we would sleep outside, and we would have a campfire at night.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,519
It was great.

221
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,120
Ah, family road trip.

222
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,620
Yeah, but maybe eight hours in a car is a little too long.

223
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,159
Well, I've been on a different kind of road trip with some buddies of mine, some friends.

224
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,279
We would drive to Las Vegas.

225
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:07,980
Really?

226
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,100
Yeah, so that's really fun.

227
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,899
A bunch of crazy guys in a car going to Las Vegas and then just having fun and talking about everything.

228
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,419
So that's a much different experience than a family road trip.

229
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,960
Maybe that sounds a little bit more fun.

230
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,019
Yeah, eight hours in a car is not really that boring with all your friends.

231
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:33,860
Alright folks, we're out of time for today, but be sure to visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

232
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,139
Okay, well thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.

233
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:38,720
Bye.
