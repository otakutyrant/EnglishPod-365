00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How are you, Erika?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Marco, I'm doing really well.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How about you?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm doing great.

8
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm really excited because today we're talking about travel.

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

10
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to give you some real English to talk about travel.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Exactly.

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
English that you would use in everyday life that you hear in movies and TV shows.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
English people actually use.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Exactly.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So why don't you tell us a little bit about this lesson for today?

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
OK, so today we are going to listen as a husband and wife get ready to go on a trip.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All right.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That sounds a little bit complicated.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, let's look at our two preview words.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary Preview.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
OK, so the first word that we have is road trip.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Road trip.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Road trip.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Road trip.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OK, so road trips are really fun and interesting, right?

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Road trips are great.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You get to get in a car with your family and drive on a vacation.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, those are really fun and they're really popular in North America.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Really popular.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I've been on a million road trips.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All right, we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But now let's take a look at our second word and it's the cars packed.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The cars packed.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The cars packed.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The car is packed.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So when your car is packed, it means that?

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everything you need is inside the car.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All right, so your bags, your food, everything that you need for your trip.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Perfect.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
OK, so those were our two preview words and now we are ready to listen to the dialogue for the first time.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
OK, this dialogue will be at normal speed.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It will be fast, but don't worry if you don't understand everything.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
After 10 minutes, we promise you will understand everything in this lesson.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So are we all ready to go?

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yep, I think so.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The car is packed.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We have munchies and music and the maps in the car.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Did you get the camera?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Got it.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Did you fill up the tank?

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yep, it's all set.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sure.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We've got all our bases covered.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, let's get going then.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I love road trips.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Do you think we can make a pit stop?

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, she forgot to go to the bathroom.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, I hate it when this happens.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This happens to me on almost every road trip.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OK, great.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So now it's time for our language takeaway.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We have three words for our language takeaway today.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Language takeaway.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And the first word is munchies.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Munchies.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Munchies.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So munchies are the words that we use in our language takeaway.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Munchies are?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Snacks.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Snacks.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Food.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Food.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Chips.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Chips.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Cookies.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Chocolate bars.

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All that good stuff.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I love munchies.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And they're really good when you're taking a road trip.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Indeed.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
OK, so let's take a look at our second language takeaway word for today.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And it is fill up the tank.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Fill up the tank.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Fill up the tank.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Fill up the tank.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So this is to?

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Put gas in your car.

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Put gas in the gas tank.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Put gas in the gas tank.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly.

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
All right, our last language takeaway today is?

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Pit stop.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Pit stop.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pit stop.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Make a pit stop.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a quick stop for you to get some gas, food, go to the bathroom.

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, a pit stop.

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A quick stop.

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Great.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So now it's time for putting it together.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Putting it together.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
OK, so we have two great phrases for you today.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's take a look at the first one.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We've got all our bases covered.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We've got all our bases covered.

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We've got all our bases covered.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is a really great phrase and it's really useful, right?

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, let's listen to a couple of examples.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Example one.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We've got all our bases covered in case the hurricane hits.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Example two.

117
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
OK, I have my keys, wallet and passport.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Looks like I have all my bases covered.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
OK, it's clear now, but you can use this in a lot of different situations, right?

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can use this in many situations.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If I'm at work, I could say, all right, we've got a really good marketing plan.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We've got all our bases covered.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Exactly.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have everything ready.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're all prepared.

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Perfect.

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right.

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now let's take a look at our second phrase and it's, let's get going.

129
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's get going.

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's get going.

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's get going.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All right, so when you say, let's get going, it just means?

133
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's start.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's start.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah.

137
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
OK, but the interesting thing about this phrase is you can change it a little bit and it means something different.

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's listen to a couple of examples.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Example one.

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have the chicken, so let's get cooking.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Example two.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This house is really scary.

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's get out of here.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Example three.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I have another meeting in 20 minutes, so let's get down to business.

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So let's get down to business, Marco.

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's get down to business.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one more time, but this time?

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It'll be a little bit slower and you'll understand much better.

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So are we all ready to go?

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yep, I think so.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The car's packed.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We have munchies and music and the map's in the car.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Did you get the camera?

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Got it.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Did you fill up the tank?

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yep, it's all set.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sure.

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We've got all our bases covered.

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, let's get going then.

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I love road trips.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Um, do you think we can make a pit stop?

164
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But we've only been on the road for 10 minutes.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So that was a little more clear this time, wasn't it?

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, you can definitely understand better about what we've been talking about.

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yep.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, so now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Erica, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great useful phrases to help you express your ideas clearly.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, great.

173
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So let's look at Fluency Builder.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fluency Builder.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
All right, so we all know how to ask the question.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Are we ready to go?

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's right, you can say, can we go now?

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Or you can say, are we ready to go?

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Exactly.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But there's another way that we can say this, and we heard it in our dialogue.

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So let's listen.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, are we all ready to go?

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, are we all ready to go?

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Wow, that sounds really good.

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It sounds a lot more fluent.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Fluent, exactly.

187
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, so another simple phrase that we all know how to say is, it is ready.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It is prepared.

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It is ready.

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Right.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So these examples are fine, they're right.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, they're correct English, no problem.

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But there's another way to say this that we heard in the dialogue, and it sounds a lot more fluent.

194
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yep, it's all set.

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yep, it's all set.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's all set, that sounds much better.

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes, and we're all set to listen to this dialogue for a third time, and this time it's going to be at its normal speed.

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, are we all ready to go?

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yep, I think so.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The car's packed, we have munchies and music, and the map's in the car.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Did you get the camera?

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Got it.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did you fill up the tank?

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yep, it's all set.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're sure we're not forgetting anything?

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sure.

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We've got all our bases covered.

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Well, let's get going then.

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I love road trips.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you think we can make a pit stop?

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But we've only been on the road for ten minutes.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I know, but I forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So Erica, you said you've been on a million road trips.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What was that all about?

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where have you been?

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, well maybe not a million road trips, but many road trips.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Every summer I used to go on a road trip with my family, and we would drive many, many hours, probably eight hours in one day, up to northern Canada.

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh wow, nice.

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, and then we would go camping, and we would sleep outside, and we would have a campfire at night.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It was great.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ah, family road trip.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, but maybe eight hours in a car is a little too long.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, I've been on a different kind of road trip with some buddies of mine, some friends.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We would drive to Las Vegas.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Really?

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah, so that's really fun.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
A bunch of crazy guys in a car going to Las Vegas and then just having fun and talking about everything.

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So that's a much different experience than a family road trip.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Maybe that sounds a little bit more fun.

230
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah, eight hours in a car is not really that boring with all your friends.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alright folks, we're out of time for today, but be sure to visit our website at EnglishPod.com and leave all your questions and comments.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay, well thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.

233
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Bye.
