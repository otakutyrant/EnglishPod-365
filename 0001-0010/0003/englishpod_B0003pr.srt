00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Amira and I are here today with an interesting lesson about a hotel situation.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more information?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, the situation is taking place in a hotel, and someone is checking in and is obtaining an upgrade.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
An upgrade.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Okay.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's an interesting word.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue, and then we'll come back and explain all this vocabulary.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Good afternoon.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What can I do for you?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'd like to check in, please.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alright.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Roberts.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, Mr.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Roberts, we've been expecting you.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, and here is your key card to the Presidential Suite.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But there must be some mistake.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My reservation was for a standard room.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you sure?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let me double-check.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is my confirmation number.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're right, Mr.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Roberts.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There seems to be a mix-up.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Unfortunately, we're overbooked at the moment.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Not to worry.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Woohoo!

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Presidential Suite, baby!

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay, everyone.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That is nice, huh?

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, the guy is really excited that he's gonna get the Presidential Suite.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There's some interesting phrases and vocabulary items here, and I know, Marco, you want to talk about some of them.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Right.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Alright, the first one, and this is really useful for all of our listeners who travel a lot, this phrase will come in handy, and it is, I have a reservation under the name.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Under the name.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Under the name.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Under the name.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So before we explain this phrase, let's listen to some examples on how it is used in other situations, and then we'll come back and give you more information.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My secretary made a reservation under my name.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry, sir, I don't have a reservation under that name.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do you have a reservation under the name Smith?

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Alright, some really good examples there on how we could use this phrase in other situations, but just in case, let me explain it real fast.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Under the name means that when you go to the restaurant or a hotel, and you tell them your name, they know that you are the person that they have been expecting.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They have been waiting.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, I have chosen another useful phrase for you, and it is mix up.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mix up.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mix up.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mix up.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There seems to be a mix up.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Before we talk about this phrase, let's listen to some examples of how it is used.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There was a mix up at the airport, and my bags were sent to Antarctica.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry, sir, there's been a terrible mix up.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We've given you the wrong baby.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, that was useful and funny.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, that's the baby situation.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh my God, imagine that happening.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, I know.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Well, guys, so a mix up is a confusion or a misunderstanding.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Exactly, well put.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Alright Marco, what do you have for us?

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, the next word that you should take a look at is overbooked.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Overbooked.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Overbooked.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Overbooked.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What does that mean?

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So if a hotel or a flight is overbooked, it means that they are full.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They are more than full.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right, so they cannot accept any more people.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Exactly.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, now why is this phrase useful?

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because it happens all the time.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's so many other situations where you can use this word or hear it from other native English speakers.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
For example, a bus or a train can be overbooked.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Exactly, that's really common.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, let's take a look at the last phrase for today, and that is complimentary upgrade.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Complimentary upgrade.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Complimentary upgrade.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Complimentary upgrade.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So this means that, for example, when the hotel is overbooked and all of their standard rooms are full, they will give you a better room, a more expensive room, but free.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, because it was not your fault.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right, this also happens sometimes, if you're lucky, on airplane flights.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So if you are an economy class and an airplane, but for some reason it's overbooked, they will move you to business class or first class for free.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have a similar story, but I'm not going to tell you about it now.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
For now, let's go and listen to the dialogue one more time, and when we come back, we'll talk some more.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Good afternoon, what can I do for you?

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'd like to check in, please.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Alright, um, Roberts.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, Mr.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Roberts, we've been expecting you, and here is your key card to the Presidential Suite.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But, there must be some mistake, my reservation was for a standard room.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you sure?

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let me double-check.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, here, this is my confirmation number.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're right, Mr.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Roberts, there seems to be a mix-up, unfortunately we're overbooked at the moment.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So?

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not to worry, we're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Woo-hoo!

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Presidential Suite, baby!

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I love listening to this dialogue, it's just so nice to see that someone is enjoying his upgrade so much, huh?

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, especially since he was expecting just a really normal room, and now he's gonna be treated like a king.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So Marco, have you ever gotten a complimentary upgrade?

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, yes I did.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
When I was traveling through India, I bought a normal seat in the train, but for some reason, it was overbooked.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So I talked to the station manager, and I got a complimentary upgrade to first class.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I had a similar experience as well, I was flying from Shanghai to Qatar, and I actually had an economy seat, but for some reason, they just upgraded me, and I was so happy.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh really?

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Like, it wasn't overbooked.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, I'm not sure, because normally the night flight is not that full, but they upgraded me for some reason, and I was so happy, it was an upgrade to first class.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Wow, that's really cool, I would prefer a first class upgrade on an airplane, yeah, any day.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, you know what really amazed me was the food you get there, you know, you have a five course meal.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh really?

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And you get all the drinks you can get, right?

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Exactly.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Wow, I would be really happy there.

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Alright everyone, we're out of time today, but be sure to listen tomorrow, because we'll be back again with another great podcast, and also, don't forget to go to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave us all your questions and comments in our community forum.

130

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Bye.
