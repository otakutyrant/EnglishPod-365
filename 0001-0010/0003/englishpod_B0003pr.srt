00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,840
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,996
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:07,790
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,650
Amira and I are here today with an interesting lesson about a hotel situation.

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,552
Amira, why don't you give us a little bit more information?

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,359
Well, the situation is taking place in a hotel, and someone is checking in and is obtaining an upgrade.

7
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:26,760
An upgrade.

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,180
Okay.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,693
That's an interesting word.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,900
Why don't we listen to the dialogue, and then we'll come back and explain all this vocabulary.

11
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:43,752
Good afternoon.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,887
What can I do for you?

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,700
I'd like to check in, please.

14
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:49,781
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

15
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:50,860
Alright.

16
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:52,763
Roberts.

17
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:56,174
Oh, Mr. Roberts, we've been expecting you.

18
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:59,221
Oh, and here is your key card to the Presidential Suite.

19
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,940
But there must be some mistake.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,740
My reservation was for a standard room.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,374
Are you sure?

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,580
Let me double-check.

23
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:07,520
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,140
Here.

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,319
This is my confirmation number.

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,203
You're right, Mr. Roberts.

27
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,320
There seems to be a mix-up.

28
00:01:14,603 --> 00:01:17,076
Unfortunately, we're overbooked at the moment.

29
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,614
So?

30
00:01:20,072 --> 00:01:20,916
Not to worry.

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,803
We're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

32
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:24,720
Woohoo!

33
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:26,894
Presidential Suite, baby!

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,618
Okay, everyone.

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,312
That is nice, ha?

36
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:40,785
Yeah, the guy is really excited that he's gonna get the Presidential Suite.

37
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:41,330
Yes.

38
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:48,160
There's some interesting phrases and vocabulary items here, and I know, Marco, you want to talk about some of them.

39
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:48,720
Right.

40
00:01:48,829 --> 00:02:00,523
Um, the first one, and this is really useful for all of our listeners who travel a lot, this phrase will come in handy, and it is, I have a reservation under the name.

41
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,283
Under the name.

42
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:04,065
Under the name.

43
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:05,650
Under the name.

44
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:16,610
So before we explain this phrase, let's listen to some examples on how it is used in other situations, and then we'll come back and give you more information.

45
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:28,014
My secretary made a reservation under my name.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,098
I'm sorry, sir, I don't have a reservation under that name.

47
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,527
Do you have a reservation under the name Smith?

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:52,698
Alright, some really good examples there on how we could use this phrase in other situations, but just in case, let me explain it real fast.

49
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:06,700
Under the name means that when you go to the restaurant or a hotel, and you tell them your name, they know that you are the person that they have been expecting, they have been waiting.

50
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,356
Yes.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,462
Well, I have chosen another useful phrase for you, and it is mix up.

52
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,876
Mix up.

53
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:16,420
Mix up.

54
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:17,207
Mix up.

55
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,645
There seems to be a mix up.

56
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:25,878
Before we talk about this phrase, let's listen to some examples of how it is used.

57
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:38,020
There was a mix up at the airport, and my bags were sent to Antarctica.

58
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,824
I'm sorry, sir, there's been a terrible mix up.

59
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:51,786
We've given you the wrong baby.

60
00:03:58,563 --> 00:04:00,678
Okay, that was useful and funny.

61
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,074
Yeah, that's the baby situation.

62
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,360
Oh my God, imagine that happening.

63
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,213
Yeah, I know.

64
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,763
Well, guys, so a mix up is a confusion or a misunderstanding.

65
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:12,540
Uh-huh

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,820
Exactly, well put.

67
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:16,186
Alright Marco, what do you have for us?

68
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:21,104
Okay, the next word that you should take a look at is overbooked.

69
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:22,780
Overbooked.

70
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:23,862
Overbooked.

71
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,240
Overbooked.

72
00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:26,365
What does that mean?

73
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:32,129
So if a hotel or a flight is overbooked, it means that they are full.

74
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,900
They are more than full.

75
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,306
Right, so they cannot accept any more people.

76
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,472
Exactly.

77
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,407
Okay, now why is this phrase useful?

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,078
Because it happens all the time.

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:52,952
There's so many other situations where you can use this word or hear it from other native English speakers.

80
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:57,920
Um, for example, a bus or a train can be overbooked.

81
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,022
Exactly, that's really common.

82
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:07,108
Okay, let's take a look at the last phrase for today, and that is complimentary upgrade.

83
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,500
Complimentary upgrade.

84
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,984
Complimentary upgrade.

85
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,179
Complimentary upgrade.

86
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:28,100
So this means that, for example, when the hotel is overbooked and all of their standard rooms are full, they will give you a better room, a more expensive room, but free.

87
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,440
Yes, because it was not your fault.

88
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:36,240
Right, this also happens sometimes, if you're lucky on airplane flights.

89
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,116
Yes.

90
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:47,325
So if you are an economy class and an airplane, but for some reason it's overbooked, they will move you to business class or first class for free.

91
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,100
I have a similar story, but I'm not going to tell you about it now.

92
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:58,182
For now, let's go and listen to the dialogue one more time, and when we come back, we'll talk some more.

93
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,630
Good afternoon, what can I do for you?

94
00:06:08,274 --> 00:06:09,660
I'd like to check in, please.

95
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,540
I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.

96
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,523
Alright, um, Roberts.

97
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,984
Oh, Mr. Roberts, we've been expecting you, and here is your key card to the Presidential Suite.

98
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:26,500
But, there must be some mistake, my reservation was for a standard room.

99
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,148
Are you sure?

100
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,474
Let me double-check.

101
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,106
Yeah, here, this is my confirmation number.

102
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,851
You're right, Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a mix-up, unfortunately we're overbooked at the moment.

103
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,415
So?

104
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:46,609
Not to worry, we're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.

105
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,478
Woo-hoo!

106
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,664
Presidential Suite, baby!

107
00:06:56,662 --> 00:07:04,880
I love listening to this dialogue, it's just, ah... it's just so nice to see that someone is enjoying his upgrade so much, huh?

108
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:12,198
Yeah, especially since he was expecting just a really normal room, and now he's gonna be treated like a king.

109
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:15,939
So Marco, have you ever gotten a complimentary upgrade?

110
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:17,912
Yes, yes I did.

111
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:27,828
When I was traveling through India, I bought a normal seat in the train, but for some reason, it was overbooked.

112
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:36,312
So I talked to the station manager, and I got a complimentary upgrade to first class.

113
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:48,312
I had a similar experience as well, I was flying from Shanghai to Qatar, and I actually had an economy seat, but for some reason, they just upgraded me, and I was so happy.

114
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:49,036
Oh really?

115
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,460
Like, it wasn't overbooked.

116
00:07:50,746 --> 00:08:01,740
Well, I'm not sure, because normally the night flight is not that full, but they upgraded me for some reason, and I was so happy, it was an upgrade to first class.

117
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,988
Wow, that's really cool, I would prefer a first class upgrade on an airplane, yeah, any day.

118
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:13,980
Well, you know what really amazed me was the food you get there, you know, you have a five course meal.

119
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:14,640
Oh really?

120
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,200
Yes.

121
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,920
And you get all the drinks you can get, right?

122
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,746
Exactly.

123
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,240
Wow, that would be really happy there.

124
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:28,708
Alright everyone, we're out of time today, but be sure to listen tomorrow, because we'll be back again with another great podcast.

125
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:38,019

126
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:52,003
