00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,540
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,350
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,280
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,350
Amira and I are here today with another interesting and useful lesson for you English learners.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,700
Amira, why don't you explain a little bit of what this lesson is about today?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's about calling in sick.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,460
Oh, okay.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,350
That's useful.

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,440
Yes, definitely.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,580
It happens to everyone once in a while.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,700
You don't feel so well, or you feel well but you don't want to go to work, so you call in sick.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,100
Alright. Okay.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:44,050
So let's listen to this dialogue, and I want everyone to keep their ears open and see if the boss believes this person.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's listen.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,960
Hello, Daniel speaking.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,820
How may I help you?

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,220
Hi, Daniel.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,240
Julie here.

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,380
Oh, hi, Julie.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,000
How are you?

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,580
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

22
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,300
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,000
What's wrong?

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,340
I have a headache, a sore throat, a runny nose, and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,020
I see.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,640
So you're calling in sick.

28
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,700
Yes.

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,380
I was hoping to take the day off to recover.

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,320
Okay, then.

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Try and get some rest.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,180
Marco, do you think he believed her?

33
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,200
No, I don't think he believed her.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
He didn't sound really convinced.

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,800
Yes, and Julie didn't sound really sick, huh?

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Exactly.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,880
Well, we have some really good vocabulary here.

38
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,350
Amira, why don't you begin with the first one?

39
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,560
The first phrase I've chosen for you is a very, very useful one.

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm feeling quite ill today.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm feeling quite ill today.

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,180
All right.

43
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,560
What does this mean exactly?

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,840
It means that she's feeling sick.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, okay.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,640
That's clear.

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,600
So she is sick.

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,640
She's feeling sick.

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,840
Okay, let's look at another really useful phrase, and this one is I'm coming down with the flu.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm coming down with the flu.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm coming down with the flu.

52
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,240
All right, and this phrase means that I am starting to get the flu or I am getting the flu.

53
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, the next phrase I have for you is calling in sick.

54
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,760
Calling in sick.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,740
Calling in sick.

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,000
Calling in sick.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,760
It means calling your boss to tell him that you can't come to work today.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,620
I personally love this phrase because it saves so much time and explanations.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,320
Okay, perfect.

60
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,680
So if I say this, then everyone will know that I am not coming to work today.

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,180
Yes, definitely.

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,680
Perfect.

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,300
All right, and the last phrase that we're going to take a look at today is I was hoping to take the day off.

64
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,260
I was hoping to take the day off.

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,640
I was hoping to take the day off.

66
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,680
I was hoping to take the day off.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,340
Right, and she says this to ask for permission because she does not want to go to work.

68
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, now couldn't she just say like I can't come today?

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,600
Right, she could say I can't come today, but that would be a little bit impolite.

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,520
Okay, so when she says I was hoping to take the day off, it's a polite way of asking.

71
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,260
It's a polite way, exactly, because she is talking to her boss.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
Very good.

73
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,000
So let's listen to the dialogue one more time.

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,640
The dialogue is a little different this time.

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,960
Listen carefully and see if you think the boss believes her this time.

76
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,260
Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you?

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
Hi Daniel, Julie here.

78
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,620
Hi Julie, how are you?

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,000
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.

80
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,840
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

81
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,620
What's wrong?

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,620
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

83
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,940
I have a headache, a sore throat, a runny nose, and I'm feeling slightly feverish.

84
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,320
I see, so are you calling in sick?

85
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,320
Yes, I was hoping to take the day off to recover.

86
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,980
Okay then, try and get some rest.

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,660
Okay guys, we're back, and I do think he believed her this time.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,640
Yeah, I think he was understanding when he said, okay then, try and get some rest.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah, and Julie sounded pretty sick.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,700
Yes, yes she did.

91
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,860
Yeah, it was convincing.

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,640
Well, you know what, I almost called in sick last week.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,820
Really?

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,640
Yeah, I wasn't feeling very well, and so I almost didn't come to work.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,560
Oh, that would have been really bad for me.

96
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,520
I would have been stuck here without you, Marco.

97
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,500
Yeah, you would have had to do the podcast all by yourself.

98
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh no.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,520
You know, actually I had the same symptoms as Julie.

100
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:34,220
I also had a headache, and I had a sore throat, and also the worst thing and the thing that I hate the most is I had a runny nose.

101
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,760
Oh no, that's really bad, because then you have to like blow your nose all the time, and then it gets red and it hurts, right?

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,300
Exactly, yeah.

103
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,320
Luckily, I didn't have a fever though.

104
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, thank God. Yeah.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,660
So did you take some medicine, and it just killed everything?

106
00:05:51,140 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, I had a friend, and he had some pills for the flu, and he just gave me a couple, and I felt better in about two days.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, great.

108
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:08,580
Well, so guys, let me tell you about a very funny thing that really happens in real life in Egypt.

109
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,520
What story do you have for us today?

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Well, it's actually not a story.

111
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,280
It's a fact.

112
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,740
I mean, people in Egypt, when they're sick, they never call in sick themselves.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,720
They'll have someone do that for them.

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh, that's interesting.

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,520
Why?

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,820
Why do they do this?

117
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,460
Well, there's this weird speculation about, you know, if you can make it to the phone, you can make it to the office.

118
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,200
I agree.

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,840
If I were a boss, I would do the same thing.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,740
Yeah.

121
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:53,840
