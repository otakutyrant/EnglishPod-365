00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,599
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,599
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:08,679
All right.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,560
Amira is here today, and she is going to tell us about the wonderful lesson she has prepared this time.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, thank you, Marco.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,579
Well, today, we have a very interesting lesson prepared for you.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,699
It's about someone cutting in line.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,760
Cutting in line?

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,280
Okay.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:32,640
Yeah, it happens all the time, and we all get very upset about it, but, you know, it happens.

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:33,920
Right, right.

13
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,280
Well, I imagine that everyone is wondering what cutting in line is.

14
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:48,359
Why don't we just listen to the dialogue one time, and then when we come back, Amira and I will gladly explain all the vocabulary in this dialogue.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,560
Let's listen.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,579
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,719
Yeah, but just relax, honey.

19
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,219
We're here, and we're going on vacation.

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,659
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.

21
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:10,620
I don't know.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,480
Look at that line.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,140
It must be a mile long.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,019
There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Honey, don't.

26
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:22,659
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there.

27
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:23,180
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,900
No, seriously, I was here first, and you can't cut in line like this.

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,519
Says who?

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,280
I do.

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,340
So sue me.

32
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,560
All right, that's it.

33
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,500
Whoa, I think there's punching.

34
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,379
Yeah, I guess this guy was just a crazy, I don't know, impatient man, huh?

35
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:56,560
Yes, yes, but we don't want to talk about this now, but for now, we will treat some of the vocabulary and very useful phrases in the dialogue.

36
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:58,700
So Marco, do you want to start?

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,159
Yes, let's take a look at our first word would be unbelievable.

38
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,060
Unbelievable.

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,379
Unbelievable.

40
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:08,539
Unbelievable.

41
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,960
Exactly, and just how you say it, it's something incredible, something amazing.

42
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:21,500
Yeah, but I would like to point out that unbelievable was used here to describe the man's frustration.

43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
He's not happy about the traffic in New York.

44
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,120
Exactly, perfect.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:40,400
Okay, in the next part, the woman, she's trying to calm and relax her husband, and she says that they'll be in Hawaii in a few hours, and you'll be on the golf course.

46
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:45,759
Right, so we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,319
Yes, we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.

48
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,379
So this is a great way of talking about your physical location in the future.

49
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:00,460
Right, so for example, Amira, tomorrow, where will you be?

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,419
Don't worry, Marco, I'll be in the office tomorrow.

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,780
Perfect, right?

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,439
That's where I need you to be.

53
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:07,979
Yes.

54
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:08,659
Okay.

55
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,199
All right, well, I have another interesting phrase here for you, must be a mile long.

56
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:16,580
A mile long.

57
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:18,699
A mile long.

58
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,280
A mile long.

59
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:33,099
Now, that's basically not a mile, it's not a kilometer long, but it's another way of saying that this line is really, really long.

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,020
Right, it's just an exaggeration.

61
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,419
Now let's take a look at there's no way.

62
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,439
There's no way.

63
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,180
There's no way.

64
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,620
There's no way.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:54,860
Perfect, let's listen to some other examples on how we use there's no way in a different situation, and then we can come back and talk about it a little bit more.

66
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,360
There's no way I can have those reports finished today.

67
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,660
The stadium is so crowded that there's no way we'll find a seat.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Do you think Michael's going to buy that house?

69
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,939
There's no way he has enough money to buy it.

70
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,319
All right, everyone, so there's no way is another way of saying it is impossible.

71
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:44,560
Exactly.

72
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,120
There's no way you should miss this podcast, right?

73
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes.

74
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,879
Well, I have another phrase for you as well.

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,620
Cut in line.

76
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,100
Cut in line.

77
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:57,540
Cut in line.

78
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,060
Cut in line.

79
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,759
Cut in line.

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,879
So, again, we have some really good examples on how you could use this phrase in different situations.

81
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,579
Let's listen to the examples, and then we can come back and talk about it some more.

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,180
Excuse me, I'm really late.

83
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,639
Can I cut in line, please?

84
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:31,500
I hate it when people cut in line at the bank.

85
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,540
It's so rude.

86
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:35,439
I think it's okay when a pregnant woman cuts in line.

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,060
All right, everyone, cut in line.

88
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:53,240
Right, so from the examples, we can understand that it means when you are standing in line somewhere and somebody gets in front of you.

89
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,680
I have another phrase for you here.

90
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,939
Sue me.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,199
Sue me.

92
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,459
Sue me.

93
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:01,920
Sue me.

94
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,560
Okay, now, sue me is not a nice phrase.

95
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,459
If you hear that, you know you're in trouble.

96
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,579
Yeah, it's kind of rude, I guess, to say sue me.

97
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:14,120
Right.

98
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:23,220
Well, it actually means like taking someone to court and asking for money because someone has harmed you in a way.

99
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:36,579
I think that we should listen to the dialogue one more time and try to figure out why he used that phrase and if he's really going to take him to court.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,120
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,180
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

102
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,240
Yeah, but just relax, honey.

103
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,759
We're here and we're going on vacation.

104
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,199
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,019
Oh, no, look at that line.

106
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,680
It must be a mile long.

107
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,560
There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

108
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,879
Honey, don't.

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there.

110
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:09,720
Yeah.

111
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,399
No, seriously, I was here first and you can't cut in line like this.

112
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,100
Who says who?

113
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:14,860
I do.

114
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:15,899
So sue me.

115
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,399
All right.

116
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,100
That's it.

117
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:22,759
All right.

118
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:23,779
We're back now.

119
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,779
This guy, when he says sue me, he's just being rude.

120
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:34,379
I mean, he's just being kind of impolite, impolite and telling him, I don't care.

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:34,959
Right.

122
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,759
Exactly.

123
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,199
Like you can't do anything about it.

124
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,019
Yeah.

125
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:39,759
Yeah.

126
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:40,240
OK.

127
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:42,379
Today in the studio, we have a guest.

128
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,939
Her name is Sarah and she's from England.

129
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:46,939
Hi there.

130
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,860
Hello.

131
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:49,779
All right.

132
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:56,839
So we're going to be asking her a couple of questions and she'll be a frequent guest on our show.

133
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,300
So you can expect to hear from her a lot.

134
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:00,560
Well, she didn't know that.

135
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,420
Yes, it's a surprise.

136
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,240
She knows now.

137
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:10,259
Well, Sarah, our topic today is about jumping the queue.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,040
OK, Amira, wait.

139
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,079
What is this jump the queue?

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
It's the same as cut in line, but in British English.

141
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,699
Ah, OK.

142
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,019
Queuing is very important in England.

143
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,920
We're very proud of our queues.

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,620
It's true.

145
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,160
It's true.

146
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,620
So so what would be the reaction of people if they like, you know, cut in line?

147
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,519
I think we do take it very seriously.

148
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,100
I'm laughing now, but it's it's quite serious.

149
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,700
So you don't dump the queue.

150
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,659
If people jump in front of you, it's you get a little touch since you shouldn't be doing that.

151
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,419
And we make it very obvious.

152
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,620
And so you say it out loud.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,879
We would, you know, perhaps say something.

154
00:08:55,059 --> 00:09:06,139
And we have systems, you know, in London on the metro, on the underground, you have to stand on the escalators on the right and queue and you can't jump in front.

155
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,600
You have to walk on the left and queue on the right.

156
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,659
And it's all very serious as there's rules and regulations.

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,440
Is there like a queue handbook that you have to read in high school and kind of take a test on?

158
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,799
Perhaps there should be.

159
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,480
There should be.

160
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,000
What about New York, Marco?

161
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,480
Well, no, definitely.

162
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,519
I guess this dialogue is similar to a reality of New York.

163
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:39,419
If somebody gets in front of you or cuts the line, somebody is going to say something and probably end up in a fight if the guy is rude.

164
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:40,960
Oh, my God.

165
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,539
Yeah.

166
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:48,679
Well, Sarah, why don't you tell us, is there a line or a queue for almost everything in England?

167
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:52,120
It seems like we do just like to form a queue.

168
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,700
So, you know.

169
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,340
Can you think of like some other examples of where you would normally you wouldn't queue, but you do?

170
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:00,720
Oh, gosh.

171
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:06,740
Things like in the supermarket, when you're trying to find some vegetables or something, I'd never push.

172
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,620
I'd never reach around or anything.

173
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,720
I'd just wait until that person had finished picking up their stuff and then and then go in.

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,559
So just try and.

175
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,299
So if like five people want to buy oranges at the supermarket, then you have a little mini queue of five people waiting.

176
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,559
There's no sort of just shoving through to the front.

177
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,799
You just don't do that.

178
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,059
So you don't stick your hand out and grab like a tomato.

179
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:33,159
If you do again, you would make sure that that person knows.

180
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,279
I'm just in a hurry or whatever.

182
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,600
But yeah, it's just letting someone go before you.

183
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,559
It's a courtesy.

184
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,519
I think it's quite important to us.

185
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,019
All right.

186
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,500
Right.

187
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:45,039
Great.

188
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,539
Thank you so much, Sarah.

189
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,220
It's a pleasure.

190
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,179
Yeah, we'll have you back very soon.

191
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,700
So.

192
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:50,620
All right.

193
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:53,960
We're out of time, but we'll be back tomorrow with another lesson.

194
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:56,059
And be sure to visit our website.

195
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:08,639

197
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:15,860
But for now, I wish you all well and bye.
