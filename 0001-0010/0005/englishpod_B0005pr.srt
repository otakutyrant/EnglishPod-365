00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm Amira.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Amira is here today, and she is going to tell us about the wonderful lesson she has prepared this time.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, thank you, Marco.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, today, we have a very interesting lesson prepared for you.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's about someone cutting in line.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Cutting in line?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, it happens all the time, and we all get very upset about it, but, you know, it happens.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Right, right.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, I imagine that everyone is wondering what cutting in line is.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Why don't we just listen to the dialogue one time, and then when we come back, Amira and I will gladly explain all the vocabulary in this dialogue.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's listen.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, but just relax, honey.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We're here, and we're going on vacation.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Look at that line.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It must be a mile long.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Honey, don't.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, seriously, I was here first, and you can't cut in line like this.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Says who?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I do.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So sue me.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right, that's it.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Whoa, I think there's punching.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, I guess this guy was just a crazy, I don't know, impatient man, huh?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, yes, but we don't want to talk about this now, but for now, we will treat some of the vocabulary and very useful phrases in the dialogue.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So Marco, do you want to start?

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, let's take a look at our first word would be unbelievable.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Unbelievable.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Unbelievable.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Unbelievable.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Exactly, and just how you say it, it's something incredible, something amazing.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, but I would like to point out that unbelievable was used here to describe the man's frustration.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He's not happy about the traffic in New York.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Exactly, perfect.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, in the next part, the woman, she's trying to calm and relax her husband, and she says that they'll be in Hawaii in a few hours, and you'll be on the golf course.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Right, so we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So this is a great way of talking about your physical location in the future.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Right, so for example, Amira, tomorrow, where will you be?

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't worry, Marco, I'll be in the office tomorrow.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Perfect, right?

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's where I need you to be.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right, well, I have another interesting phrase here for you, must be a mile long.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A mile long.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A mile long.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A mile long.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now, that's basically not a mile, it's not a kilometer long, but it's another way of saying that this line is really, really long.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right, it's just an exaggeration.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now let's take a look at there's no way.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's no way.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's no way.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's no way.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Perfect, let's listen to some other examples on how we use there's no way in a different situation, and then we can come back and talk about it a little bit more.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There's no way I can have those reports finished today.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The stadium is so crowded that there's no way we'll find a seat.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you think Michael's going to buy that house?

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's no way he has enough money to buy it.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All right, everyone, so there's no way is another way of saying it is impossible.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Exactly.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
There's no way you should miss this podcast, right?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, I have another phrase for you as well.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Cut in line.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Cut in line.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Cut in line.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Cut in line.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Cut in line.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, again, we have some really good examples on how you could use this phrase in different situations.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's listen to the examples, and then we can come back and talk about it some more.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Excuse me, I'm really late.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Can I cut in line, please?

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I hate it when people cut in line at the bank.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's so rude.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I think it's okay when a pregnant woman cuts in line.

87
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right, everyone, cut in line.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Right, so from the examples, we can understand that it means when you are standing in line somewhere and somebody gets in front of you.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have another phrase for you here.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sue me.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sue me.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sue me.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Sue me.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, now, sue me is not a nice phrase.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you hear that, you know you're in trouble.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, it's kind of rude, I guess, to say sue me.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Right.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, it actually means like taking someone to court and asking for money because someone has harmed you in a way.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think that we should listen to the dialogue one more time and try to figure out why he used that phrase and if he's really going to take him to court.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can't believe it took us two hours to get here.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The traffic in New York is unbelievable.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, but just relax, honey.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We're here and we're going on vacation.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In a few hours, we'll be in Hawaii and you'll be on the golf course.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, no, look at that line.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It must be a mile long.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's no way I'm waiting for another two hours.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Honey, don't.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hey, man, the end of the line is over there.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, seriously, I was here first and you can't cut in line like this.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who says who?

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I do.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So sue me.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
All right.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's it.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We're back now.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This guy, when he says sue me, he's just being rude.

120
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I mean, he's just being kind of impolite, impolite and telling him, I don't care.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Right.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Exactly.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Like you can't do anything about it.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
OK.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Today in the studio, we have a guest.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Her name is Sarah and she's from England.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hi there.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hello.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
All right.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So we're going to be asking her a couple of questions and she'll be a frequent guest on our show.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So you can expect to hear from her a lot.

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, she didn't know that.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes, it's a surprise.

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She knows now.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, Sarah, our topic today is about jumping the queue.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OK, Amira, wait.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is this jump the queue?

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's the same as cut in line, but in British English.

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ah, OK.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Queuing is very important in England.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We're very proud of our queues.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's true.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's true.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So so what would be the reaction of people if they like, you know, cut in line?

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I think we do take it very seriously.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm laughing now, but it's it's quite serious.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So you don't dump the queue.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If people jump in front of you, it's you get a little touch since you shouldn't be doing that.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And we make it very obvious.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And so you say it out loud.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We would, you know, perhaps say something.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And we have systems, you know, in London on the metro, on the underground, you have to stand on the escalators on the right and queue and you can't jump in front.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You have to walk on the left and queue on the right.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And it's all very serious as there's rules and regulations.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is there like a queue handbook that you have to read in high school and kind of take a test on?

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Perhaps there should be.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There should be.

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What about New York, Marco?

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, no, definitely.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I guess this dialogue is similar to a reality of New York.

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If somebody gets in front of you or cuts the line, somebody is going to say something and probably end up in a fight if the guy is rude.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, my God.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, Sarah, why don't you tell us, is there a line or a queue for almost everything in England?

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It seems like we do just like to form a queue.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So, you know.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Can you think of like some other examples of where you would normally you wouldn't queue, but you do?

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, gosh.

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Things like in the supermarket, when you're trying to find some vegetables or something, I'd never push.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'd never reach around or anything.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'd just wait until that person had finished picking up their stuff and then and then go in.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So just try and.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So if like five people want to buy oranges at the supermarket, then you have a little mini queue of five people waiting.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There's no sort of just shoving through to the front.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You just don't do that.

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So you don't stick your hand out and grab like a tomato.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you do again, you would make sure that that person knows.

180
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm just in a hurry or whatever.

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But yeah, it's just letting someone go before you.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a courtesy.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think it's quite important to us.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
All right.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Right.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Great.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thank you so much, Sarah.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a pleasure.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, we'll have you back very soon.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right.

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We're out of time, but we'll be back tomorrow with another lesson.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And be sure to visit our website.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:08,000

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But for now, I wish you all well and bye.
