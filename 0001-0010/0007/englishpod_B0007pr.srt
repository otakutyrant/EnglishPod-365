00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey Erica, how are you today?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Marco, I am doing really well and I'm really looking forward to today's lesson.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well so am I because here at EnglishPod we're giving you real English.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Everyday English.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Exactly, English that you hear in movies or in TV shows.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is English people actually use.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So Erica, what is our topic for today?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well today we're talking about computer viruses.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Perfect, so I think it's time for us to take a look at our preview.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay today we've got two words to preview.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The first word is virus.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Virus.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Virus.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So if your computer has a computer virus, it means your computer is sick, right?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Actually, a computer virus is a program that is designed to harm or to damage your computer.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh I see, okay, well thank you for being so technical.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's the technical explanation.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay let's take a look at our second word for our preview today and that would be froze.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Froze.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Froze.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Froze.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So if your computer froze it means that your computer stopped working.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Your applications or your programs stopped working and you just can't do anything.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Your computer is broken.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay great, so let's listen to our dialogue.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's going to be a little bit fast, but...

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't worry if you don't understand everything.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
At the end of this podcast you'll understand everything.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Perfect, let's listen.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh great, the stupid computer froze again.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's the third time today.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's acting up again.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It must have a virus or something.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just give me a second, I'll be right up.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well you have to make sure their antivirus software is updated regularly.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, anything else?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Um, yeah, sorry about that.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well I completely understand this guy.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When my computer freezes I kick it and punch it and do everything to it.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well I hope you don't punch it too hard Marco.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well it's still working so it's alright.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Alright, let's take a look at our language takeaway.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Language takeaway.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In today's language takeaway we have two words.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The first word for today is infected file.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Infected file.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Infected file.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Infected file.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And what is an infected file?

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
An infected file is a file in your computer that has a virus in it.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ah, perfect.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's really clear.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What is our second word for the language takeaway today?

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Our second word is not up to date.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Not up to date.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not up to date.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And what is it when something is not up to date?

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It means it doesn't have all the most recent information.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, perfect.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now let's listen to some examples.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Example 1.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I need to buy a new computer because mine isn't up to date.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Example 2.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can't find the street.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you sure this map is up to date?

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Example 3.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Example 4.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Sarah has just finished the reports and all the information is up to date.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, that was pretty clear.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You know, you can also use this phrase positively.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can say up to date.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay, for example we can say this is a new map.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is the most up to date map.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Exactly, or if I bought a new computer I could say I just got a new computer.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
All my software is up to date.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, great.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So now let's take a look at some phrases.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And it's time for putting it all together.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Putting it together.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, so Samuel said a really great phrase.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He said, I'll be right up.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll be right up.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll be right up.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll be right up.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now we can use this phrase in a lot of different situations.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So let's listen to some examples.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Example 1.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Can you help me with my computer?

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll be right there.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Example 2.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come downstairs, dinner is ready.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll be right down.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Example 3.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hurry up, I need to use the bathroom!

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll be right out.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay, really great and clear examples, right?

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, you know that phrase, I'll be right out?

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I used to hear this all the time when I was young.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Really?

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How come?

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, I have two sisters and we were always fighting for the bathroom.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So someone was always saying, just a minute, I'll be right out.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, that's common.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I had that too when I was young.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, now our second phrase is, it turns out that.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It turns out that.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It turns out that.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It turns out that.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is a great phrase, you can use it in many different situations.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Marco, can you give us an example?

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sure, for example, I can say, Frank didn't come to work today and it turns out that he was sick.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yep, or I could say, oh, I've been feeling really sick recently.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why?

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It turns out that I'm pregnant.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh my god, are you really pregnant?

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I'm not, I'm just kidding.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it'll be.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A little bit slower.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Alright.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh great, this stupid computer froze again.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's the third time today.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's acting up again, it must have a virus or something.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just give me a second, I'll be right up.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yours wasn't up to date.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's probably what was causing your problems.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, anything else?

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Um, yeah, sorry about that.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, that was a lot more clear this time.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Definitely, yeah, I understood a lot more.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, so now it's time to look at Fluency Builder.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Erica, why don't you explain what Fluency Builder is?

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In Fluency Builder, we give you some great useful phrases to help you express your ideas clearly.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, great, so let's look at Fluency Builder.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Fluency Builder.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay, so in this dialogue, we know his computer wasn't working.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right, so many students would probably say his computer was acting strangely.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
His computer isn't working properly.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Exactly, and that's perfect and that's fine.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, but there's a really great way to say it that we heard in the dialogue.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's acting up again.

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's acting up again.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I love this phrase, it's acting up.

157
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, it sounds really natural.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It sounds really natural.

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, we're ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But this time, it'll be at the normal speed.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Try and see if you can hear these keywords.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh great, the stupid computer froze again.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's the third time today!

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC?

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's acting up again.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It must have a virus or something.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Just give me a second, I'll be right up.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I ran a virus scan on your computer and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.

169
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay, anything else?

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer.

175
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Um, yeah, sorry about that.

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So Marco, I really think that my computer actually has a virus now.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really?

178
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How come?

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Because I have been turning on my computer and then suddenly it turns off by itself.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It shuts down by itself.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, that sounds like a virus.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But I ran a virus scan and there was no problem.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Well, maybe your anti-virus software isn't up to date.

184
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, I guess I'd better call Samuel.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, you can call Samuel to fix it.

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
