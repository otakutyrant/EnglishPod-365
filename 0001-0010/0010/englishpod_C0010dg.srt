00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:20,000
EnglishPod.com Alright people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales and we need to do it now.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I want concrete solutions.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How do you plan to drive sales?

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market, so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Lower our prices.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Not very creative.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It'll never fly with Swan.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What kind of thinking is that?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Anyone have a better plan?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Natalie?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Perhaps a promotion.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Maybe a two-for-one offer or something like that.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wow, that's the same thing.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Bad idea.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Really bad idea.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Damn it, people, come on!

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Think!

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hello, Mr.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Swan.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, Mr.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Swan.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello, Mr.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Swan.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Do we have any ideas yet?

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, Mr.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Swan.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
A two-for-one promotion.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hmm.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I kind of like the sound of that.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It sounds like something we should consider.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, exactly!

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's just what I was thinking.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm glad we thought of that.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Very creative.
