00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:20,460
EnglishPod.com Alright people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales and we need to do it now.

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,760
I want concrete solutions.

3
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,519
How do you plan to drive sales?

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:33,259
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market, so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

5
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:34,899
Lower our prices.

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,380
Not very creative.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,600
It'll never fly with Swan.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,020
What kind of thinking is that?

9
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,979
Anyone have a better plan?

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,560
Natalie?

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,520
Perhaps a promotion.

12
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:47,920
Maybe a two-for-one offer or something like that.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,439
Wow, that's the same thing.

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,500
Bad idea.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,979
Really bad idea.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,100
Damn it, people, come on!

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,619
Think!

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,119
Hello, Mr.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Swan.

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,479
Oh, Mr.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,740
Swan.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,439
Hello, Mr.

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:01,659
Swan.

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,740
Do we have any ideas yet?

26
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,619
Yes, Mr.

27
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:03,880
Swan.

28
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,260
We were kind of considering a two-for-one offer to get more competitive.

29
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,640
A two-for-one promotion.

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:10,480
Hmm.

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,079
I kind of like the sound of that.

32
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,900
It sounds like something we should consider.

33
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,920
Yeah, exactly!

34
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,640
That's just what I was thinking.

35
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,180
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

36
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,099
I'm glad we thought of that.

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:19,980
Very creative.
