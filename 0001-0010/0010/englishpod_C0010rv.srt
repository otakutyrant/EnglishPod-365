66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If we want to drive sales, I think we need to spend more time training our salespeople.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Drive sales.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The most important thing for us right now is to focus on driving sales.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Drive sales.

Dale, have you come up with any concrete solutions?

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry, but I just can't offer any concrete solutions right now.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Promotion.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We can't have a sales promotion right now because our costs are too high.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Promotion.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The department store is offering a promotion.

Promotion.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
A two-for-one promotion might be a way to attract new customers.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We guarantee that we can match the competitors' lowest price.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's impossible for us to match the competitors.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Our costs are just too high.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you think we can match the competitors' quality and still keep our price low?

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In the market.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
iPods are the most popular MP3 players in the market.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
In the market.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Our product is the cheapest in the market.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We'll never fly.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This marketing plan will never fly.

95
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We just don't have enough money for it.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We'll never fly.

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I like that idea, but it'll never fly with management.

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We'll never fly.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We'll never fly.

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Brad told me his idea for a film script, but the story will never fly.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's not interesting enough.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be here any minute.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hurry up!

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The bus will be here any minute.

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Be here any minute.

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Nick just called.

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He said he should be here any minute.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Be here any minute.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is everything prepared for the meeting?

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To consider.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We're considering a sales promotion.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
To consider.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think we need to consider a new sales strategy.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
To consider.

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Have you considered reducing the price?

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Brilliant.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's a brilliant idea.

119
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Brilliant.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Brilliant.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
