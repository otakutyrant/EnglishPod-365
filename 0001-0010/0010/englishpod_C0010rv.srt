If we want to drive sales, I think we need to spend more time training our salespeople.

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,120
Drive sales.

68
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,420
The most important thing for us right now is to focus on driving sales.

69
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,220

Dale, have you come up with any concrete solutions?

74
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,019
I'm sorry, but I just can't offer any concrete solutions right now.

75
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,240
Promotion.

76
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,100
We can't have a sales promotion right now because our costs are too high.

77
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:30,339
Promotion.

78
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,100
The department store is offering a promotion.

Promotion.

82
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,360
A two-for-one promotion might be a way to attract new customers.

83
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,279
We guarantee that we can match the competitors' lowest price.

84
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,139
It's impossible for us to match the competitors.

85
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
Our costs are just too high.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,180
Do you think we can match the competitors' quality and still keep our price low?

87
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,899
In the market.

88
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,720

iPods are the most popular MP3 players in the market.

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,300
In the market.

92
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:05,699
Our product is the cheapest in the market.

00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:09,160
We'll never fly.

94
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,100
This marketing plan will never fly.

95
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:22,699
We just don't have enough money for it.

96
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,319
We'll never fly.

97
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,079
I like that idea, but it'll never fly with management.

98
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,560
We'll never fly.

99
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,600
We'll never fly.

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,379
Brad told me his idea for a film script, but the story will never fly.

101
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,079
It's not interesting enough.

102
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,540
Be here any minute.

103
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:59,860

104
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,839
The bus will be here any minute.

105
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:05,339
Be here any minute.

106
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:12,639
Nick just called.

107
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,579
He said he should be here any minute.

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,240
Be here any minute.

109
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,319
Is everything prepared for the meeting?

110
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,519
The CEO will be here any minute.

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,839
To consider.

112
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,019
We're considering a sales promotion.

113
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,480
To consider.

114
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,840
I think we need to consider a new sales strategy.

115
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,240
To consider.

116
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,460
Have you considered reducing the price?

117
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,179
Brilliant.

118
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,000
That's a brilliant idea.

119
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,440
Brilliant.

120
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,220
