1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco and I am joined by Erica.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
How are you, Erica?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm doing great, Marco and you?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Excellent.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm doing really well and I'm really excited about our lesson for today.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We've got an intermediate lesson today and we're going to study some real English.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
English that you use every day, right?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
English that native speakers really use.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Exactly.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And today, as Erica mentioned, we have an intermediate lesson and not only is it intermediate but it's a business lesson.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, so today we're listening in to a sales meeting and we're going to learn some great useful English to talk about sales strategies.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we're going to learn English for sales strategies, for making suggestions and for responding to suggestions.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Great, so why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview for today.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So our vocabulary preview is a part of our lesson when we teach you some really important words that will help you to understand the dialogue better.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, great.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So that is what vocabulary preview is.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We have two words for you today and we can start off by looking at the first one.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Our first word today is drive sales.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Drive sales.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
To drive sales and that means?

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
To increase sales.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Right, to sell more.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Exactly, so to drive sales.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay, so now let's look at our second word and it's an interesting one.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's promotion.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Promotion.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Promotion.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Promotion.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So Erica, what is a promotion exactly?

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, so here we're not really talking about getting a better job, right?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, not like a job promotion.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, we're talking about a marketing strategy.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, so I can give you an example.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Suppose that I want to buy shampoo and if I go to the supermarket and I see buy one and get one free.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So that's a two for one.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's a two for one promotion.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, okay.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's a sales promotion or?

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Perhaps the shampoo in the supermarket is less expensive than usual.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yeah, usually maybe it costs five dollars but today it costs four dollars.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's a sales promotion.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Great, so that's a really good marketing strategy.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Exactly and we'll hear this word in our dialogue today.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Great, so we are ready to listen to our dialogue.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's gonna be pretty fast so it might be a little bit difficult to understand.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But don't worry if you don't understand everything because later in this lesson we're gonna explain all the important words and phrases.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Alright people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales and we need to do it now.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want concrete solutions.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How do you know?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In fact, we're the most expensive in the market so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Lower our prices?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Not very creative.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It'll never fly with Swan.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What kind of thinking is that?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Jeez, anyone have a better plan?

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Natalie?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Perhaps a promotion.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's the same thing.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Bad idea.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Really bad idea.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Dammit people, come on.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Think.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hello Mr.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Swan.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hello Mr.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Swan.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hello Mr.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Swan.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do we have any ideas yet?

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes Mr.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Swan, we were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A two for one promotion, hmm.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I kind of like the sound of that.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It sounds like something we should consider.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's just what I was thinking.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm glad we thought of that.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Very creative.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, so an interesting manager, right?

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know about interesting.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Maybe I would think bad manager.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We're gonna talk about him later on in the show but now let's take a look at our language takeaway.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Language takeaway.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, so language takeaway is the part of our lesson where we teach you the most important words from the dialogue.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All these words that we are going to focus on can be found in today's dialogue.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Exactly, so we have three words for you today.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's look at the first one.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Match the competitors.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Match the competitors.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Match the competitors.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Match the competitors.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Great, so we have some examples for you so you can listen and try and see if you can figure out what match the competitors really means.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Example one.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We guarantee that we can match the competitors lowest price.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Example two.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's impossible for us to match the competitors.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Our costs are just too high.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Example three.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you think we can match our competitors prices and still keep our quality high?

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, so I see that match the competitors means to be as good as or better than other companies in the same industry.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Exactly, match the competitors.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Alright, so let's move to our second word today for language takeaways and it is in the market.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In the market.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In the market.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In the market.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We heard this phrase in the dialogue and it means in the industry.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Exactly, I can say for example English pod is the best language pod in the market.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So of all the podcasts that teach English, English pod is the best.

116
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Of course, no doubt about it.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I totally agree.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Alright, or I can give you another example.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
iPods are the most popular mp3 players in the market.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So of all the mp3 players in the world, iPods are the most popular.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So let's move to our final word for today.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And it is it'll never fly.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It'll never fly.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It'll never fly.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It will never fly.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So this phrase sounds a little bit strange.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I know fly.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Are we talking about an airplane here?

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's going on?

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Exactly, but we're not so so we're gonna give you some examples and try and guess what it'll never fly really means.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Example one.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This marketing plan will never fly.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just too expensive.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Example two.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What you want to sell bikinis in Alaska?

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That'll never fly.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Example three.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Brad told me his idea for film script, but the story will never fly.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not interesting enough.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it means it won't work.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It won't work.

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not a good idea.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They'll never agree.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Exactly.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Great.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So now we've seen a lot of useful phrases and we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But this time it's going to be slow.

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So you'll be able to understand a little bit better and you'll be able to hear the words and phrases we were just talking about.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Alright people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And we need to do it now.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I want concrete solutions.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How do you plan to drive sales, Roger?

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lower our prices.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Not very creative.

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It'll never fly with Swan.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What kind of thinking is that?

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Geez, anybody else have a better plan?

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Natalie?

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Perhaps a promotion.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What?

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's the same thing.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Bad idea.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Really bad idea.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Damn it, people.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Come on.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Think.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hello, Mr.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Swan.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh, Mr.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Swan.

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hello, Mr.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Swan.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Do we have any ideas yet?

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yes, Mr.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Swan.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A two for one promotion.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hmm.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I kind of like the sound of that.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It sounds like something we should consider.

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, exactly.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's just what I was thinking.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
In fact, that's a brilliant idea.

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm glad we thought of that.

189
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Very creative.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, great.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I hope everyone understands a lot better now.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I hope everyone could listen out for some of those key words.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Fluency Builder.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So with Fluency Builder, we try to help you increase your fluency.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We take a word or phrase that you already know and show you how to say it a little bit more naturally, a little bit more like a native English speaker.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Right.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And we have three of these words for you today.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah, let's start with the first one.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, so often students will say something like, I'll be here soon or I will arrive soon.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Right.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And these sentences are correct.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They're totally fine.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But I think there's a better way to say this.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Right.

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And we heard it in the dialogue.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So let's listen to what the person in the dialogue said.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay, so be here any minute.

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He'll be here any minute.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It just sounds a little bit more natural.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah, I think I use this phrase quite often.

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He'll be here any minute.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He'll be here soon.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yeah, great.

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, so let's move on to our second phrase for Fluency Builder.

219
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So this phrase will help you to learn how to say I'm thinking about something in a better sounding way.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right, so you can say something like, we are thinking about a sales strategy.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Or, that sounds like something we should think about.

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Right.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it's perfectly correct.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, there's no problem with this.

225
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But in the dialogue, we heard something a little bit different.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So let's listen to it.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It sounds like something we should consider.

228
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It sounds like something we should consider.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So consider sounds like a pretty natural way of saying it, right?

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, and you think it sounds really kind of smart.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yeah, it sounds more formal, even a little more professional.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yeah, yeah, it's a good word.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yep.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay, brilliant.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So let's move on to our third word.

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Marco, you already said our third word.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, yeah, I actually did.

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Brilliant.

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's a great word right there.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah.

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A lot of people might say, that's a great idea or great.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But in the dialogue, we heard another way of saying the same idea.

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's a brilliant idea.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's a brilliant idea.

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay, so this is great.

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But I would have to say that it's a little bit more British English.

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, I'd agree with you there.

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I also think it sort of gives more power to this idea that it's a good idea.

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Brilliant idea.

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's a really, really good idea.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I like that word.

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay, so we're ready to listen to our dialogue again a third time, but at its normal speed.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right, people, we're holding this meeting today because we've got to do something about our sales, and we need to do it now.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I want concrete solutions.

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How do you plan to drive sales?

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Roger?

259
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, in fact, we're the most expensive in the market, so maybe we need to lower our prices to match the competitors?

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Lower our prices.

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Not very creative.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It'll never fly with Swan.

263
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What kind of thinking is that?

264
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Jeez.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Anyone have a better plan?

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Natalie?

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Perhaps a promotion.

268
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Maybe a two for one offer or something like that.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's the same thing.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Bad idea.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Really bad idea.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Damn it, people, come on.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Think.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The CEO will be here any minute.

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hello, Mr.

276
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Swan.

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, Mr.

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Swan.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hello, Mr.

280
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Swan.

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do we have any ideas yet?

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes, Mr.

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Swan.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We were kind of considering a two for one offer to get more competitive.

285
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
A two for one promotion.

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I kind of like the sound of that.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It sounds like something we should consider.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, exactly.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's just what I was thinking.

290
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
In fact, it's a brilliant idea.

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm glad we thought of that.

292
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Very creative.

293
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
All right, so listening to this dialogue makes you think about this boss.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm pretty sure everyone has had a manager or a supervisor that's similar to this guy.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yeah, this boss, Clark, I would have to say he sounds like a terrible person to work for.

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, that's true.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you're a manager, you want to motivate your employees.

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I think it's the most important thing a manager does is to encourage his or her employees and to help support them to grow and to be better people in the job.

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And this guy is totally not doing this.

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And you can tell because they are a little bit scared of talking and he cuts them off with saying, oh, it's a bad idea.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Give me a better idea and stuff like that.

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, I could never work for a guy like this.

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You know, my first boss that I had when I first entered the workforce, I was in a very junior position and I was working for a large company.

304
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And the general manager of the company, he was amazing.

305
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He was so encouraging.

306
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He knew every single employee's name, first name, and he would make an effort to stop and say hello and ask them how things were going.

307
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And you know what?

308
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This left me with such a good feeling about the company that I really wanted to work hard for this company and try my best.

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I think that I've never met such a great boss as this guy.

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No, I think that's true.

311
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Definitely.

312
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If you have a boss that's encouraging and motivating like that, it makes you work harder and makes you feel part of a really special team.

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And that's something we can all agree on.

314
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And I'm sure all our managers out there do the same.

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well, you know what?

316
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I hope some of our listeners log on to our website and maybe they can tell us experiences with bad managers or good managers, or if they are managers, how they handle things.

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah.

318
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And hopefully they can use some of these great phrases that we talked about today.

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Great.

320
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So be sure everyone to visit our website at EnglishPod.com and where you can find a lot of other information and really good resources to continue improving your English.

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's right.

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So thanks for listening today, everyone.

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
And until next time, this is goodbye.
