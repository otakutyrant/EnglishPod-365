00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,540
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,299
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,359
My name is Katherine, and today we have a lesson for you all about school.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,220
That's right.

5
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:14,140
Today we're going to take a look at a child's report card.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:21,219
So we're going to talk a little bit about what this means, what is a report card, and also everything that's inside this report.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:21,980
That's right.

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,300
So we're going to learn how to describe a child's schoolwork.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,820
Is it good?

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,460
Is it bad?

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,320
Let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a minute to discuss the meaning of some of these words and phrases.

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,939
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,399
Let's have a look.

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:43,640
What is this?

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,280
Where are all the grades?

16
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,359
He's in the third grade, Sam.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,439
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,920
A one means his achievement or work is excellent.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,840
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,240
What about here in physical education?

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,799
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,000
We should work on that with him.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,439
So confusing.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,560
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

25
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:19,939
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,040
So now let's start with some language.

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,060
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,760
All right, the first phrase here we have in language takeaway is actually a thing.

30
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,239
It's the report card, and this is the topic of today's dialogue.

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:37,939
That's right.

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,900
Now, you may remember, I'm sure pretty much it's standard everywhere in the world.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,140
You get a report, a small little report that tells your parents how well or how poorly you are doing in school.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,019
That's right.

35
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:59,799
Right, so after maybe two or three months, your teacher will write down how she or he thinks that you're performing at school.

36
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,379
That's right.

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,959
And usually parents have to sign this.

38
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,340
They have to say, okay, I see that my child is doing well or that he's doing poorly, and then the teacher will know as well.

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,659
And I think, well, you get report cards in elementary school, in high school, and also in university, right?

40
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,699
You do get a report card of some sort.

41
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,300
That's right.

42
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:20,080
Well, in university in America, we call them grades.

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,639
We don't really call them a report card.

44
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:28,039
In high school, middle school, and elementary school, so before college, we actually have a piece of paper.

45
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:28,460
Right.

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,719
And that's why it's called a card.

47
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:30,560
Yeah, that's right.

48
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,439
I think now for universities especially, you just go online and you see your grades.

49
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,319
That's right.

50
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,360
It's on the internet.

51
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:44,680
But the important thing about the report card is that it tells a parent and a student what his or her grades are.

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,460
That's right.

53
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,659
So the grades, this is a noun, is basically your score.

54
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:50,740
That's right.

55
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:59,000
So maybe you took a test and you did very well on your test, and you had some homework, and you did very well on your homework, so you have a good grade.

56
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,740
That's right.

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,699
But if you don't do your homework and you don't do well on your test, you have a bad grade.

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,240
That's right.

59
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,719
So for example, like in the United States, it's over 100 points.

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,639
So maybe a good grade would be 95 points out of 100.

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,860
So we call that an A.

62
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,659
That's called an A, that's right.

63
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:21,199
Or if you have a bad grade, maybe that's an F, which is 20% or 30%.

64
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,479
Right.

65
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:34,580
Okay, so now this is where we need to make a difference between the grades that his father was looking for, and then the mom says he's in the third grade.

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,099
So it's very different between having good grades or bad grades and fifth grade or third grade.

67
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:44,080
All right, two different grades, and we know this is confusing.

68
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
So we want to explain a little bit.

69
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,379
Third grade is actually the third year of elementary school.

70
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

71
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:00,319
So in the American education system, we start in kindergarten, and we have first grade, second grade, third grade, all the way up until the end, which is 12th grade.

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,860
That's right.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So that's everything between when you're five years old and when you're 18 years old.

74
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,479
And each year at school is a grade, a level.

75
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,560
That's right.

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,560
So as you said, it's a grade in different parts of the country.

77
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm not really sure if they call them a grade or they have the same system, but basically that's what it means in English.

78
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,019
You have first grade, third grade, 12th grade, finally, when you graduate.

79
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,379
That's right.

80
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,560
So you can say, my son is in eighth grade.

81
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,040
That means he's in his eighth year of school.

82
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:31,540
Right.

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,720
Very good.

84
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,480
So that is the difference.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:43,500
And now we're going to take a look at something that has to do with grades as well, is the marks that you get in your test or in your report card.

86
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,240
So this might actually help.

88
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,740
Remember when we said on your report card, your teacher might write down your grade.

89
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,000
That means, do you have an A or a B or a C.

90
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,300
Well, another way to call this is a mark.

91
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,839
So he has good marks.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,860
He has good grades.

93
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,680
So they're basically the same thing, grades and marks.

94
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:01,220
That's right.

95
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:01,620
They are.

96
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:06,639
And I know that in Britain, I think people more commonly say marks.

97
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,600
She got terrible marks at school and her father was angry with her.

98
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:18,120
But in America, we often say, you know, if you get good grades, I'll buy you sweets.

99
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,220
That's right.

100
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:19,699
Okay.

101
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,839
So you get a prize if you get good grades usually.

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,959
Well, it depends on your parents.

103
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,259
On your parents.

104
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:23,779
That's right.

105
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:35,759
Now, as we said, you can have a grade that's usually a number or a letter like A, B, C, D, F, but you can also get marks that are just very much black or white.

106
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,420
It's satisfactory or unsatisfactory, like in this case.

107
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right.

108
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,939
So satisfactory, this is an adjective, it describes something, is a good thing.

109
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:46,680
Okay.

110
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:49,040
So how did he do?

111
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,439
Well, his performance was satisfactory.

112
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,139
It's okay.

113
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,199
But if it's bad or if it's not good, we call it unsatisfactory.

114
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,019
That's right.

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,540
So this doesn't really have a number, as you can tell.

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,079
It's just basically pass or fail.

117
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,819
That's about it.

118
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:05,480
Good or bad.

119
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,000
Good or bad.

120
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,379
That's it.

121
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:06,899
Exactly.

122
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:07,699
No grade.

123
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,540
And we'll explain this in a minute.

124
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,759
There are some classes where you can't have a grade, like an A or a B, and that's why we have this satisfactory, unsatisfactory.

125
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,439
That's right.

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,160
All right.

127
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,879
So we've taken a look at a lot of language there.

128
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,899
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

129
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,420
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,920
Let's have a look.

131
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,199
What is this?

132
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,879
We're all the grades.

133
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,860
He's in the third grade, Sam.

134
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,959
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

135
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,480
A one means his achievement or work is excellence.

136
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,279
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

137
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,759
What about here in physical education?

138
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,319
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

139
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,500
We should work on that with him.

140
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,000
So confusing.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,160
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

142
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,060
All right, we're back.

143
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,959
So now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

144
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:15,660
Fluency Builder.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,720
You could have said, let's have a look, Marco.

146
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,180
That's one of the key phrases in today's dialogue.

147
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

148
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,639
He, the dad, got the report card and said, all right, let's have a look.

149
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,860
All right, this is a very common way to say, let's see, or let me look at that.

150
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,639
So let's have a look.

151
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,560
Maybe it's just one person, me, but we still say this, let, let us.

152
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:39,620
So it's plural.

153
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,019
It's very weird, but it just means let me look, let me see.

154
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:52,560
And exactly as you said, even though it's in plural and you may be by yourself or only you are going to look at something, people still say, let's have a look.

155
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,540
Let's have a look here.

156
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,199
That means I want to look at this.

157
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
So if I say, hey, I just bought this new CD.

158
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:01,439
Okay, I can say, hey, let's have a look.

159
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,000
All right.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,459
And I could give it to Marco and he can look at the case and see who the musician is.

161
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,100
That's right.

162
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,779
All right.

163
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,360
Now talking about one of the subjects in school, that means some of the classes that you have.

164
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,680
We had science, we have history, and there's another one called physical education.

165
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:17,300
All right.

166
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,540
So this is a class that has many different names.

167
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:23,160
It's physical, so you know that it has to do with your body.

168
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,660
So basically, it's a sports class and you play sports like football, basketball, things like that.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,339
It's also called PE.

170
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:32,759
PE for short, yeah.

171
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,960
Because remember, physical in English starts with a P, PH, physical.

172
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:43,879
But this is what I was saying earlier, Marco, you can't give a person an A or a B in physical education.

173
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,879
Well, you don't really.

174
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,379
So normally, students get satisfactory or unsatisfactory, right?

175
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,200
Because usually, it doesn't mean that you have to be very good at sports.

176
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,080
Sometimes it's just the effort counts.

177
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:07,700
You may not be very good at soccer or football or basketball, but if you try really hard, you're running around and you're actually doing what you're supposed to be doing, then you get a satisfactory note.

178
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,480
It means, yeah, I mean, you're not the best player in the world, but you're doing what you're supposed to.

179
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:12,059
Exactly.

180
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,279
All right.

181
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,720
So now when the father was talking, he's like, oh, you know, I don't understand this report card.

182
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,960
In my day, we got an A or a B.

183
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:22,720
All right.

184
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,960
So this is a common phrase that people say when they want to talk about when they were children or when they were growing up.

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,179
So older people often say, oh, in my day, things were different.

186
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,059
So this is a way to make a comparison between now and the past.

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,600
Yeah, right.

188
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:48,240
You're basically saying when I was a child or many years ago, this was what happened or this is how it used to be.

189
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,899
In my day, school was much more difficult.

190
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,539
Today, it's very, very easy.

191
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:55,240
That's right.

192
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,080
So this is how you start this comparison between the time when you were a child to now.

193
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,480
Yes.

194
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,539
In my day.

195
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:02,899
All right.

196
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:08,379
And to finish off, we're going to talk about failing an exam because obviously sometimes you do fail.

197
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,340
Yeah.

198
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,539
And if you fail an exam, you get a very bad grade, an F.

199
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,279
An F.

200
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,440
So F for fail.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,659
It's easy to remember.

202
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,580
That's right.

203
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,720
So you say you can say I didn't pass the exam, but you can also say I failed the exam.

204
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,019
Yes.

205
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:29,720
And normally fail means you received less than 60 percent.

206
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:30,720
That's right.

207
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,960
Or 50 percent.

208
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,860
So it's 50 percent.

209
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:41,720
So basically you missed if there are 10 questions on the exam, you missed five or six or seven or all the way to 10 of them.

210
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,480
So you missed more than half of the questions.

211
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,059
That's right.

212
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:52,419
And it's not only for school, for example, your driver's exam, when you're going to get your driver's license, you can also pass or fail that exam.

213
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,639
And if you fail the exam, you have to take it again.

214
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,100
That's right.

215
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,820
So that's all the fluency builder words we have for you today.

216
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,360
Let's take a look at them again and we'll be right back.

217
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,019
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

218
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,500
Let's have a look.

219
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:14,659
What is this?

220
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,379
Where are all the grades?

221
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,480
He's in the third grade, Sam.

222
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:23,539
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

223
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,039
A one means his achievement or work is excellence.

224
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:31,899
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

225
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,340
What about here in physical education?

226
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,899
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

227
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,100
We should work on that with him.

228
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,559
So confusing.

229
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,740
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,159
All right.

231
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,679
So big question, Marco.

232
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,039
When you were a student, did you get good grades?

233
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,600
I got good grades, but not great grades.

234
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,820
I was always the type of student that paid attention in class, did my homework, but never studied.

235
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,779
Ah, so you did not study for the tests.

236
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,779
That's why I never got an A, for example, or an A plus, but I always got a B.

237
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,779
So I was that type of just more chilled type of student.

238
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,460
You like to be in the middle.

239
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,039
Yeah.

240
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,220
Well, this was the thing.

241
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:31,299
I like to pay attention in class, so that was different because I would pay attention, I would take some notes, but then I would just remember everything.

242
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,360
So I did all right for the exam, didn't really have to study.

243
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:34,919
I see.

244
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,460
But sometimes in other subjects I did, I really liked them, so I wasn't studying, it was more fun for me, so then I would get great grades.

245
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,100
All right.

246
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,539
What about you?

247
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,779
Well, I always studied for tests, so generally my grades were pretty good.

248
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,799
Now something that we didn't talk about here is a GPA.

249
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,799
This is something that is very popular in the United States.

250
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,759
Basically, even if you want to apply for schools, your GPA is what counts.

251
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,279
What is a GPA?

252
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:01,720
That's right.

253
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,340
Well, we don't really have a GPA until high school, and then it's in high school and college.

254
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,440
And GPA stands for grade point average, so grade point average.

255
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:22,980
That means we take all of our marks or all of our grades together, so science grade, English grade, history grade, and we make an average.

256
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:30,720
So if I get mostly A's, my GPA is 4.0.

257
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:36,059
If I get mostly B's, my GPA is 3.0, and then it goes lower and lower.

258
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:42,379
And if you have a really bad GPA like a 1, you probably won't finish high school.

259
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,500
Now the GPA is very important for many reasons.

260
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,940
First of all, because it's also kind of a summary of your application to universities, right?

261
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,320
They take a look at your GPA.

262
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Yes, absolutely.

263
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,379
So this is a way to say, okay, how is this student overall?

264
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,200
How is this student in all of her classes, not just one class?

265
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:06,559
Right.

266
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:10,899
And then they see if you have a 3.5, they say, oh, well, it's pretty good.

267
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,320
Yeah, 3.5 is good.

268
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,279
4 is the best.

269
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:18,799
And again, 3 is good, it's okay, but a 2 or a 1 is not very good.

270
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,299
That's right.

271
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,240
So it's very interesting because all around the world, they have different grading systems.

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:31,960
I think I would say that the United States is the only place where I've seen that they use the ABCDF system.

273
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,039
In Latin American countries, for example, they don't do it over 100, they do it over 10.

274
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:37,580
Interesting.

275
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,539
So you would get a grade over 10, or in some countries, over 20.

276
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,580
I've seen that as well.

277
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,059
In Italy.

278
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,240
Yeah, it's over 20.

279
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:47,700
So you would get a 14, I think, would be a passing grade over 20.

280
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,179
Well, let us know, listeners, if you have a different grading system in your country.

281
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,539
Also, you can let us know how were your grades when you're studying in school.

282
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,980
You don't have to tell us, but we'd like to talk to you about grades.

283
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,200
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

284
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:02,179
Alright, we'll see you guys there.

285
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,620
Bye.
