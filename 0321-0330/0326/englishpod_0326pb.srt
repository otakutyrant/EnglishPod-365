00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have a lesson for you all about school.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to take a look at a child's report card.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we're going to talk a little bit about what this means, what is a report card, and also everything that's inside this report.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're going to learn how to describe a child's schoolwork.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is it good?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is it bad?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a minute to discuss the meaning of some of these words and phrases.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's have a look.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is this?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Where are all the grades?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He's in the third grade, Sam.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A one means his achievement or work is excellent.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What about here in physical education?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We should work on that with him.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So confusing.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So now let's start with some language.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, the first phrase here we have in language takeaway is actually a thing.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's the report card, and this is the topic of today's dialogue.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, you may remember, I'm sure pretty much it's standard everywhere in the world.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You get a report, a small little report that tells your parents how well or how poorly you are doing in school.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Right, so after maybe two or three months, your teacher will write down how she or he thinks that you're performing at school.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And usually parents have to sign this.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They have to say, okay, I see that my child is doing well or that he's doing poorly, and then the teacher will know as well.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And I think, well, you get report cards in elementary school, in high school, and also in university, right?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You do get a report card of some sort.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, in university in America, we call them grades.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We don't really call them a report card.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
In high school, middle school, and elementary school, so before college, we actually have a piece of paper.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And that's why it's called a card.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, that's right.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I think now for universities especially, you just go online and you see your grades.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's on the internet.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But the important thing about the report card is that it tells a parent and a student what his or her grades are.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So the grades, this is a noun, is basically your score.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's right.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So maybe you took a test and you did very well on your test, and you had some homework, and you did very well on your homework, so you have a good grade.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But if you don't do your homework and you don't do well on your test, you have a bad grade.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So for example, like in the United States, it's over 100 points.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So maybe a good grade would be 95 points out of 100.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So we call that an A.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's called an A, that's right.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Or if you have a bad grade, maybe that's an F, which is 20% or 30%.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, so now this is where we need to make a difference between the grades that his father was looking for, and then the mom says he's in the third grade.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So it's very different between having good grades or bad grades and fifth grade or third grade.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right, two different grades, and we know this is confusing.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So we want to explain a little bit.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Third grade is actually the third year of elementary school.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So in the American education system, we start in kindergarten, and we have first grade, second grade, third grade, all the way up until the end, which is 12th grade.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So that's everything between when you're five years old and when you're 18 years old.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And each year at school is a grade, a level.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So as you said, it's a grade in different parts of the country.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm not really sure if they call them a grade or they have the same system, but basically that's what it means in English.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You have first grade, third grade, 12th grade, finally, when you graduate.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So you can say, my son is in eighth grade.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That means he's in his eighth year of school.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Very good.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So that is the difference.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And now we're going to take a look at something that has to do with grades as well, is the marks that you get in your test or in your report card.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So this might actually help.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Remember when we said on your report card, your teacher might write down your grade.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That means, do you have an A or a B or a C.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, another way to call this is a mark.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So he has good marks.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He has good grades.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So they're basically the same thing, grades and marks.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They are.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And I know that in Britain, I think people more commonly say marks.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She got terrible marks at school and her father was angry with her.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But in America, we often say, you know, if you get good grades, I'll buy you sweets.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's right.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So you get a prize if you get good grades usually.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, it depends on your parents.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
On your parents.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's right.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, as we said, you can have a grade that's usually a number or a letter like A, B, C, D, F, but you can also get marks that are just very much black or white.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's satisfactory or unsatisfactory, like in this case.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So satisfactory, this is an adjective, it describes something, is a good thing.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So how did he do?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, his performance was satisfactory.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's okay.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But if it's bad or if it's not good, we call it unsatisfactory.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So this doesn't really have a number, as you can tell.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's just basically pass or fail.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's about it.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Good or bad.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Good or bad.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's it.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Exactly.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No grade.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And we'll explain this in a minute.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There are some classes where you can't have a grade, like an A or a B, and that's why we have this satisfactory, unsatisfactory.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
All right.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of language there.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's have a look.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What is this?

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We're all the grades.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's in the third grade, Sam.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A one means his achievement or work is excellence.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What about here in physical education?

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We should work on that with him.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So confusing.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
All right, we're back.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Fluency Builder.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You could have said, let's have a look, Marco.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's one of the key phrases in today's dialogue.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He, the dad, got the report card and said, all right, let's have a look.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
All right, this is a very common way to say, let's see, or let me look at that.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So let's have a look.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Maybe it's just one person, me, but we still say this, let, let us.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So it's plural.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's very weird, but it just means let me look, let me see.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And exactly as you said, even though it's in plural and you may be by yourself or only you are going to look at something, people still say, let's have a look.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's have a look here.

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That means I want to look at this.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So if I say, hey, I just bought this new CD.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, I can say, hey, let's have a look.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All right.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And I could give it to Marco and he can look at the case and see who the musician is.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now talking about one of the subjects in school, that means some of the classes that you have.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We had science, we have history, and there's another one called physical education.

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
All right.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So this is a class that has many different names.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's physical, so you know that it has to do with your body.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So basically, it's a sports class and you play sports like football, basketball, things like that.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's also called PE.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
PE for short, yeah.

171
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because remember, physical in English starts with a P, PH, physical.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But this is what I was saying earlier, Marco, you can't give a person an A or a B in physical education.

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, you don't really.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So normally, students get satisfactory or unsatisfactory, right?

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Because usually, it doesn't mean that you have to be very good at sports.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Sometimes it's just the effort counts.

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You may not be very good at soccer or football or basketball, but if you try really hard, you're running around and you're actually doing what you're supposed to be doing, then you get a satisfactory note.

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It means, yeah, I mean, you're not the best player in the world, but you're doing what you're supposed to.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Exactly.

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
All right.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So now when the father was talking, he's like, oh, you know, I don't understand this report card.

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In my day, we got an A or a B.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All right.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So this is a common phrase that people say when they want to talk about when they were children or when they were growing up.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So older people often say, oh, in my day, things were different.

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So this is a way to make a comparison between now and the past.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, right.

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're basically saying when I was a child or many years ago, this was what happened or this is how it used to be.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
In my day, school was much more difficult.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Today, it's very, very easy.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's right.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So this is how you start this comparison between the time when you were a child to now.

193
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In my day.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
All right.

196
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And to finish off, we're going to talk about failing an exam because obviously sometimes you do fail.

197
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And if you fail an exam, you get a very bad grade, an F.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
An F.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So F for fail.

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's easy to remember.

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's right.

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So you say you can say I didn't pass the exam, but you can also say I failed the exam.

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And normally fail means you received less than 60 percent.

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's right.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Or 50 percent.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So it's 50 percent.

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So basically you missed if there are 10 questions on the exam, you missed five or six or seven or all the way to 10 of them.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So you missed more than half of the questions.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And it's not only for school, for example, your driver's exam, when you're going to get your driver's license, you can also pass or fail that exam.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And if you fail the exam, you have to take it again.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So that's all the fluency builder words we have for you today.

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's take a look at them again and we'll be right back.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's have a look.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What is this?

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Where are all the grades?

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He's in the third grade, Sam.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
A one means his achievement or work is excellence.

224
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What about here in physical education?

226
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We should work on that with him.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So confusing.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
All right.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So big question, Marco.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When you were a student, did you get good grades?

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I got good grades, but not great grades.

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I was always the type of student that paid attention in class, did my homework, but never studied.

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ah, so you did not study for the tests.

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's why I never got an A, for example, or an A plus, but I always got a B.

237
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I was that type of just more chilled type of student.

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You like to be in the middle.

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Well, this was the thing.

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I like to pay attention in class, so that was different because I would pay attention, I would take some notes, but then I would just remember everything.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So I did all right for the exam, didn't really have to study.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I see.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But sometimes in other subjects I did, I really liked them, so I wasn't studying, it was more fun for me, so then I would get great grades.

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
All right.

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What about you?

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, I always studied for tests, so generally my grades were pretty good.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Now something that we didn't talk about here is a GPA.

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This is something that is very popular in the United States.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Basically, even if you want to apply for schools, your GPA is what counts.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What is a GPA?

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, we don't really have a GPA until high school, and then it's in high school and college.

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And GPA stands for grade point average, so grade point average.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That means we take all of our marks or all of our grades together, so science grade, English grade, history grade, and we make an average.

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So if I get mostly A's, my GPA is 4.0.

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If I get mostly B's, my GPA is 3.0, and then it goes lower and lower.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And if you have a really bad GPA like a 1, you probably won't finish high school.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Now the GPA is very important for many reasons.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
First of all, because it's also kind of a summary of your application to universities, right?

261
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
They take a look at your GPA.

262
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes, absolutely.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So this is a way to say, okay, how is this student overall?

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How is this student in all of her classes, not just one class?

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right.

266
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And then they see if you have a 3.5, they say, oh, well, it's pretty good.

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, 3.5 is good.

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
4 is the best.

269
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And again, 3 is good, it's okay, but a 2 or a 1 is not very good.

270
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's right.

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So it's very interesting because all around the world, they have different grading systems.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think I would say that the United States is the only place where I've seen that they use the ABCDF system.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
In Latin American countries, for example, they don't do it over 100, they do it over 10.

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Interesting.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So you would get a grade over 10, or in some countries, over 20.

276
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've seen that as well.

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
In Italy.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, it's over 20.

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So you would get a 14, I think, would be a passing grade over 20.

280
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, let us know, listeners, if you have a different grading system in your country.

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Also, you can let us know how were your grades when you're studying in school.

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You don't have to tell us, but we'd like to talk to you about grades.

283
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

284
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Alright, we'll see you guys there.

285
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Bye.
