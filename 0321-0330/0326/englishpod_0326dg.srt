1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's have a look.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What is this?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Where are all the grades?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He's in the third grade, Sam.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
A one means his achievement or work is excellence.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What about here in physical education?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We should work on that with him.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So confusing.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.
