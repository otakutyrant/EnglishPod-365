00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:09,320
Look, Jimmy's report card came today.

2
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,759
Let's have a look.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,980
What is this?

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,619
Where are all the grades?

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,699
He's in the third grade, Sam.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,780
You see, under each subject that he's being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three.

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,300
A one means his achievement or work is excellence.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,179
Here in science, for example, he got a two, which means it's satisfactory.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,579
What about here in physical education?

10
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,140
He got a three here, which means it's unsatisfactory.

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,340
We should work on that with him.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,759
So confusing.

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,899
In my day, we got an A or a B if we were doing well, and if we failed an exam, we would get an F.
