00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:04,099
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:04,900
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,200
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,740
And today we're going to buy some food at a store for basically bread, right, Marco?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,320
That's right.

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,960
Today we're going to a bakery.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,320
So this is basically a shop where they sell bread and different types of bread, actually.

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,199
That's right.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,179
So we're going to learn all about these different kinds of bread.

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,960
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

11
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,899
All right.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,540
We're back.

13
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:08,540
So now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,640
In Language Takeaway today, we have many different kinds of bread.

15
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,180
The first kind actually comes to English from the French language.

16
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,420
We have croissants.

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,159
That's right.

18
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:24,819
Croissants.

19
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:30,500
Now, as you say, this is a type of bread that comes from France, I guess.

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,560
That's right.

21
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,180
It's really delicious.

22
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:36,959
It's buttery and flaky, and it's in the shape of a crescent.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,420
So it's like a curve, like a C.

24
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,260
It kind of looks like also horns because it's got a horn on each side.

25
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:45,780
It does.

26
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,260
It does.

27
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:53,200
And many people like to eat this for breakfast in France, but you can find it everywhere in America at cafes and bakeries.

28
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:53,799
OK.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,379
Very good.

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,859
So those are croissants.

31
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,739
And now we're also buying blueberry muffins.

32
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:00,620
OK.

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,799
Muffins are a delicious baked good.

34
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:08,120
Blueberry muffins are the flavor, so we can also have strawberry or orange.

35
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:12,919
But in this case, a muffin is kind of like a sweet baked good.

36
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,400
It's round.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,860
So it's kind of like a cake, like a little cake.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
It is like a little cake.

39
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,780
The top is bigger than the bottom.

40
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,879
So the bottom you have some paper to hold onto, and the top is round and maybe a little bit hard.

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:25,539
OK.

42
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,039
Very good.

43
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:27,680
So those are muffins.

44
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,000
We'll post pictures of these on the site so you can see what they look like.

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,219
But moving on now, we have a type of bread.

46
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,099
This is a sourdough bread.

47
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:38,900
All right.

48
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:45,759
So there are many, many, many different kinds of breads, but sourdough is very unique because the flavor is a little bit sour.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,639
It's strong.

50
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:55,960
So dough is the substance or what you use to make bread, right, or before bread is baked.

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,599
That's right.

52
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,939
So before you make bread, it's kind of like a liquid.

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,759
You have some milk or water that you mix with flour, so you have to hold it in a bowl or a cup.

54
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,159
And after you bake it, it becomes hard.

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,379
So dough is when it's soft and like a liquid.

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:10,840
Right.

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,680
You've seen it when they're making bread.

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,840
They have this, it looks like a paste sometimes, and then it becomes hard.

59
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
Or when they're making pizzas, that's called dough.

60
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,979
And sour, obviously, because it has that flavor that you said, a very strong sour flavor.

61
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:24,939
That's right.

62
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,620
And a different kind of bread that we might find is whole wheat bread.

63
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:29,300
OK.

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,699
Now this is like the healthy choice.

65
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,400
Yes.

66
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,719
It's normally the healthy choice.

67
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:38,759
That's because the flour that we put in the dough is whole wheat flour.

68
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,620
It's a little bit healthier.

69
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,780
It's usually a little bit darker than white flour, so it'll be brown.

70
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,759
So yeah, it's basically the brown bread.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,560
I think if you've noticed when you go to the store and you can get bread, you'll find one that looks white on the inside, and this one actually looks brown on the inside.

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,280
That's right.

73
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:03,000
And an even more brown colored bread, maybe even black, is rye bread.

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,419
So what is rye?

75
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:12,740
Rye is another kind of grain, and when you bake this rye bread, it has a very strong flavor, and it's very, very dark, almost black.

76
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,719
It's actually my favorite kind of bread.

77
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,500
So what does it taste like, or what's the difference between whole wheat bread and rye bread?

78
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,300
Rye bread is much heavier.

79
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,259
It has a stronger flavor.

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,980
Whole wheat bread is lighter.

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,199
OK.

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,220
Very good.

83
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:35,839
So obviously it may be a little bit difficult to understand the differences between the breads, but we'll post pictures on the site so you can see them.

84
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,439
And also, well, you have to go out to the bakery and try them so you can taste the difference.

85
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:42,139
That's right.

86
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:49,680
All right, so now let's move on to language takeaway part two and talk about a little bit more of the other vocab found in this lesson.

87
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,839
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
What can I get you?

89
00:04:58,579 --> 00:04:58,800
Hi.

90
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:03,120
Let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,819
Sure.

92
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,779
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

93
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,100
No, that's OK.

94
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,480
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

95
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,319
Oh, we're out at the moment.

96
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,500
May I suggest some rye bread?

97
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,779
Sure, that sounds good.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,860
Do you have any cakes?

99
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:18,759
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

100
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,160
I'll just take a cheesecake.

101
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,180
Will that be all?

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:21,779
Yes.

103
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,399
Your total is $43.20.

104
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:34,040
So when you want to go buy some bread or some baked goods, you have to know how to count those goods.

105
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,759
So today we have a couple of words to help you count bread.

106
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,759
The first one we have is dozen.

107
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:39,660
That's right.

108
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,680
So for croissants, as you can see, it's a countable noun.

109
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:47,300
And so when you ask for a dozen croissants, you're asking for 12.

110
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,079
That's right.

111
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,120
So in English, the word dozen means 12.

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,339
You can buy a dozen eggs, or in this case, a dozen blueberry muffins, maybe.

113
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:57,120
OK.

114
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,959
So it's a very popular term, a dozen or a half a dozen.

115
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,519
And sometimes people just buy six.

116
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,180
That's right.

117
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,560
So half a dozen is six.

118
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,600
A whole dozen, just say dozen, is 12.

119
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,980
You can also have something special called a baker's dozen.

120
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,199
Yes, I've heard about this.

121
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,180
What is a baker's dozen?

122
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,399
Well, a baker's dozen is basically a present the baker gives you.

123
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,180
So you buy 12, maybe 12 croissants, and the baker gives you one more.

124
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:23,139
Wow, so you get 13.

125
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,379
Yes, a baker's dozen is 13.

126
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,579
But do you ask for a baker's dozen, or does the baker say, I'm going to give you the baker's dozen?

127
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,980
I don't think I've ever asked for it.

128
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,560
I think when I've bought bagels and they give me, I say, I want a dozen bagels, they give me a baker's dozen.

129
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:37,560
They give me 13.

130
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,339
Oh, OK.

131
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,759
So when you're buying bread, now obviously you don't really buy a dozen sourdough breads.

132
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,540
You buy a dozen loaves of sourdough bread.

133
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,740
So the countable noun here is a loaf of bread.

134
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,680
One loaf, two loaves.

135
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:56,240
Now this is very interesting because in English we don't have that many counting words, measure words.

136
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,680
But for bread, we do actually have this special word.

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,639
And so you can say, I would like two loaves of sourdough bread.

138
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,899
OK, and a loaf or loaves in the plural, what is it exactly?

139
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,759
It's one big piece.

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,680
So for example, you have maybe one little piece of bread.

141
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:16,560
It's called a slice.

142
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,439
That's what you eat.

143
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,759
But when you buy the bread, you have many, many, many slices together before you cut the bread.

144
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,100
That's called a loaf.

145
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:23,959
Very good.

146
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:33,300
So actually, this is the reason why the baker or the person attending the shop asked if he would like to have the loaf sliced.

147
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,360
Would you like the loaf sliced?

148
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,699
That means, would you like us to cut pieces of bread from this loaf?

149
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,100
Because sliced bread is how you eat it.

150
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:44,980
Right, exactly.

151
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,019
You don't really take a whole loaf of bread and start eating it like that.

152
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,439
Like an animal.

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,060
No, you cut it into slices.

154
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,759
And so sliced bread, we say, is one option.

155
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,199
You can also have unsliced, which means when you go home, you cut it yourself.

156
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,060
So this is a very particular word as well, because you have the adjective to have sliced bread, right?

157
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,860
You also have the verb to slice the bread.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,920
That means to cut it into slices.

159
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,579
And of course, you have the noun slices of bread.

160
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,480
So you have the individual pieces.

161
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,060
So it can be a verb, an adjective, and a noun.

162
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,720
That's right.

163
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,279
So it can be a little confusing.

164
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:26,160
But I recommend you all check out the website and practice a little bit in the comments section.

165
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,000
All right.

166
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,300
Good.

167
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:30,220
So let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

168
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,240
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

169
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,440
What can I get you?

170
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:43,559
Hi, let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

171
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,240
Sure.

172
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,200
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

173
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,539
No, that's okay.

174
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,940
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

175
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,779
Oh, we're out at the moment.

176
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,980
May I suggest some rye bread?

177
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:53,519
Sure.

178
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,240
That sounds good.

179
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,320
Do you have any cakes?

180
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,200
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

181
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,620
I'll just take a cheesecake.

182
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,620
Will that be all?

183
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,220
Yes.

184
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,840
Your total is $43.20.

185
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,279
All right.

186
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,960
So speaking about breads now, there is some particular ingredients that we don't mention in the dialogue, obviously, but they're worth mentioning.

187
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,139
What is the one main characteristic that most breads have?

188
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:22,159
Yeast.

189
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:22,820
Yeast.

190
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,519
That's right.

191
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,580
Y-E-A-S-T.

192
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,940
Yeast.

193
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,620
Yeast is actually alive.

194
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:28,539
It's an animal.

195
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,720
It's like a bacteria.

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,419
That's right.

197
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,220
And so you wonder why are some breads flat and why are some breads big, poofy, large?

198
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,700
Well, yeast is why.

199
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,799
Basically, you can't have a big, poofy bread, a big, large, tall bread, unless you have this yeast.

200
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,600
So yeast is what makes the bread rise.

201
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:56,179
And we also mentioned flour, which is basically just a powder made out of some type of grain usually.

202
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:56,799
Yeah.

203
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,159
Usually, it's made out of wheat.

204
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,360
Obviously, whole wheat is a little bit different from the white flour, which would be different processed wheat.

205
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,879
But we also have different things that you can even have rice flour.

206
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,980
Corn flour.

207
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,740
Corn flour.

208
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,759
So corn bread would be, of course, yellow because corn is yellow.

209
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:20,679
Now, so you can hear that we say the word flour, like a rose is a flour, but it's actually spelled different.

210
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,659
F-L-O-U-R, flour.

211
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,039
So there's two different things.

212
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:30,960
There's flowers in your garden and there's flour, F-L-O-U-R, which is something you can cook with.

213
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,539
That's right.

214
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,539
These are called homophones.

215
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,620
So they basically have the same pronunciation, but very different spellings.

216
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,639
And very different meanings.

217
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,659
So a very interesting lesson for us today.

218
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:45,740
Go out, get some bread, try some of these if you have them available.

219
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,899
But also, come to the questions and comments section and tell us about maybe your local bread.

220
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,580
I know that many countries around the world have very specific types of bread.

221
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,360
That's right.

222
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,659
Write some names down for us, send us your pictures, and we'll see you on the website.

223
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,679
Alright, bye guys.

224
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,059
Bye.
