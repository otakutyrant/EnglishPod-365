00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to buy some food at a store for basically bread, right, Marco?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we're going to a bakery.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So this is basically a shop where they sell bread and different types of bread, actually.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we're going to learn all about these different kinds of bread.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All right.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're back.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In Language Takeaway today, we have many different kinds of bread.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The first kind actually comes to English from the French language.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We have croissants.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Croissants.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now, as you say, this is a type of bread that comes from France, I guess.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's right.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's really delicious.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's buttery and flaky, and it's in the shape of a crescent.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So it's like a curve, like a C.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It kind of looks like also horns because it's got a horn on each side.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It does.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It does.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And many people like to eat this for breakfast in France, but you can find it everywhere in America at cafes and bakeries.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OK.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Very good.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So those are croissants.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And now we're also buying blueberry muffins.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
OK.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Muffins are a delicious baked good.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Blueberry muffins are the flavor, so we can also have strawberry or orange.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But in this case, a muffin is kind of like a sweet baked good.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's round.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So it's kind of like a cake, like a little cake.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It is like a little cake.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The top is bigger than the bottom.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the bottom you have some paper to hold onto, and the top is round and maybe a little bit hard.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
OK.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Very good.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So those are muffins.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We'll post pictures of these on the site so you can see what they look like.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But moving on now, we have a type of bread.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a sourdough bread.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All right.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So there are many, many, many different kinds of breads, but sourdough is very unique because the flavor is a little bit sour.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's strong.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So dough is the substance or what you use to make bread, right, or before bread is baked.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's right.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So before you make bread, it's kind of like a liquid.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You have some milk or water that you mix with flour, so you have to hold it in a bowl or a cup.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And after you bake it, it becomes hard.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So dough is when it's soft and like a liquid.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Right.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You've seen it when they're making bread.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They have this, it looks like a paste sometimes, and then it becomes hard.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or when they're making pizzas, that's called dough.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And sour, obviously, because it has that flavor that you said, a very strong sour flavor.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And a different kind of bread that we might find is whole wheat bread.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
OK.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now this is like the healthy choice.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's normally the healthy choice.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's because the flour that we put in the dough is whole wheat flour.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a little bit healthier.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's usually a little bit darker than white flour, so it'll be brown.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So yeah, it's basically the brown bread.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think if you've noticed when you go to the store and you can get bread, you'll find one that looks white on the inside, and this one actually looks brown on the inside.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And an even more brown colored bread, maybe even black, is rye bread.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So what is rye?

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Rye is another kind of grain, and when you bake this rye bread, it has a very strong flavor, and it's very, very dark, almost black.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's actually my favorite kind of bread.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So what does it taste like, or what's the difference between whole wheat bread and rye bread?

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Rye bread is much heavier.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It has a stronger flavor.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Whole wheat bread is lighter.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OK.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Very good.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So obviously it may be a little bit difficult to understand the differences between the breads, but we'll post pictures on the site so you can see them.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And also, well, you have to go out to the bakery and try them so you can taste the difference.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All right, so now let's move on to language takeaway part two and talk about a little bit more of the other vocab found in this lesson.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What can I get you?

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hi.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Sure.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, that's OK.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, we're out at the moment.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
May I suggest some rye bread?

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sure, that sounds good.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you have any cakes?

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll just take a cheesecake.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Will that be all?

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your total is $43.20.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So when you want to go buy some bread or some baked goods, you have to know how to count those goods.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So today we have a couple of words to help you count bread.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The first one we have is dozen.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So for croissants, as you can see, it's a countable noun.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And so when you ask for a dozen croissants, you're asking for 12.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's right.

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So in English, the word dozen means 12.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can buy a dozen eggs, or in this case, a dozen blueberry muffins, maybe.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
OK.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So it's a very popular term, a dozen or a half a dozen.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And sometimes people just buy six.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's right.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So half a dozen is six.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A whole dozen, just say dozen, is 12.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You can also have something special called a baker's dozen.

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes, I've heard about this.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What is a baker's dozen?

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, a baker's dozen is basically a present the baker gives you.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you buy 12, maybe 12 croissants, and the baker gives you one more.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Wow, so you get 13.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes, a baker's dozen is 13.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But do you ask for a baker's dozen, or does the baker say, I'm going to give you the baker's dozen?

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't think I've ever asked for it.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think when I've bought bagels and they give me, I say, I want a dozen bagels, they give me a baker's dozen.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They give me 13.

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, OK.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So when you're buying bread, now obviously you don't really buy a dozen sourdough breads.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You buy a dozen loaves of sourdough bread.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So the countable noun here is a loaf of bread.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
One loaf, two loaves.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now this is very interesting because in English we don't have that many counting words, measure words.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But for bread, we do actually have this special word.

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And so you can say, I would like two loaves of sourdough bread.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
OK, and a loaf or loaves in the plural, what is it exactly?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's one big piece.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So for example, you have maybe one little piece of bread.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's called a slice.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's what you eat.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But when you buy the bread, you have many, many, many slices together before you cut the bread.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's called a loaf.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Very good.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So actually, this is the reason why the baker or the person attending the shop asked if he would like to have the loaf sliced.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Would you like the loaf sliced?

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That means, would you like us to cut pieces of bread from this loaf?

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Because sliced bread is how you eat it.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Right, exactly.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't really take a whole loaf of bread and start eating it like that.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Like an animal.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, you cut it into slices.

154
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And so sliced bread, we say, is one option.

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can also have unsliced, which means when you go home, you cut it yourself.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So this is a very particular word as well, because you have the adjective to have sliced bread, right?

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You also have the verb to slice the bread.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That means to cut it into slices.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And of course, you have the noun slices of bread.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So you have the individual pieces.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So it can be a verb, an adjective, and a noun.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So it can be a little confusing.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But I recommend you all check out the website and practice a little bit in the comments section.

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Good.

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Welcome to Al's Bakery.

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What can I get you?

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hi, let me get a dozen croissants, four blueberry muffins, and a loaf of sourdough bread.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Sure.

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Would you like to have the loaf sliced?

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No, that's okay.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you have any whole wheat bread?

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, we're out at the moment.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
May I suggest some rye bread?

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Sure.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That sounds good.

179
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you have any cakes?

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We have various birthday cakes and also some ice cream cakes.

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll just take a cheesecake.

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Will that be all?

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Your total is $43.20.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
All right.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So speaking about breads now, there is some particular ingredients that we don't mention in the dialogue, obviously, but they're worth mentioning.

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What is the one main characteristic that most breads have?

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeast.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeast.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Y-E-A-S-T.

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeast.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeast is actually alive.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's an animal.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's like a bacteria.

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And so you wonder why are some breads flat and why are some breads big, poofy, large?

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, yeast is why.

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Basically, you can't have a big, poofy bread, a big, large, tall bread, unless you have this yeast.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So yeast is what makes the bread rise.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And we also mentioned flour, which is basically just a powder made out of some type of grain usually.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah.

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Usually, it's made out of wheat.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Obviously, whole wheat is a little bit different from the white flour, which would be different processed wheat.

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But we also have different things that you can even have rice flour.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Corn flour.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Corn flour.

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So corn bread would be, of course, yellow because corn is yellow.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, so you can hear that we say the word flour, like a rose is a flour, but it's actually spelled different.

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
F-L-O-U-R, flour.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So there's two different things.

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There's flowers in your garden and there's flour, F-L-O-U-R, which is something you can cook with.

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right.

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
These are called homophones.

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So they basically have the same pronunciation, but very different spellings.

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And very different meanings.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So a very interesting lesson for us today.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Go out, get some bread, try some of these if you have them available.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But also, come to the questions and comments section and tell us about maybe your local bread.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know that many countries around the world have very specific types of bread.

221
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's right.

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Write some names down for us, send us your pictures, and we'll see you on the website.

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Alright, bye guys.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Bye.
