EnglishPod.com Ah, Michelle.

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:08,500
Hi.

3
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,820
I was hoping to see you.

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:10,679
How have you been?

5
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,539
How's the family?

6
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:12,919
Oh, hello, Mr.

7
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:13,320
Campbell.

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,539
I'm fine and Jack's doing well.

9
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:16,500
How are you?

10
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,120
I'm fine, thanks.

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,640
I got your report this morning.

12
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:20,739
Thanks for that.

13
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,219
Are you joining the conference today?

14
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,160
Yes, I'm leaving at 4 p.m.

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,559
Good, well we can discuss this more then.

16
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,579
But I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.

17
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,559
Yes, me too.

18
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,500
I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference.

19
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,920
I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.

20
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,700
No, me neither.

21
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,219
It's far too expensive.

22
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,600
Well, let's discuss this more at the conference.

23
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,219
Maybe we can share a taxi there?

24
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,100
Yes, sure.
