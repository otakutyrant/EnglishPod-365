EnglishPod.com Ah, Michelle.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I was hoping to see you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
How have you been?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
How's the family?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, hello, Mr.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Campbell.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm fine and Jack's doing well.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How are you?

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm fine, thanks.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I got your report this morning.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thanks for that.

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you joining the conference today?

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, I'm leaving at 4 p.m.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good, well we can discuss this more then.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, me too.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, me neither.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's far too expensive.

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, let's discuss this more at the conference.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Maybe we can share a taxi there?

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, sure.
