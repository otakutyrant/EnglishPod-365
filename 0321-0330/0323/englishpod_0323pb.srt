00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,859
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:07,459
And today we have a great lesson for you about traveling.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,359
That's right.

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,560
You know, we have taken a look at previous lessons where you can buy a ticket, how to book a flight, what to do at the airport.

7
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:21,000
But now we are going to see what we can do if our flight gets canceled.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,440
Okay, this is not a fun situation.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,640
But hopefully with our help, you'll be able to understand what these messages are about flights that are canceled or delayed.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,920
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

11
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,380
Good afternoon, sir.

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,780
May I please see your passport and reservation?

13
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:41,859
Here you go.

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,500
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

15
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:48,039
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,000
Canceled?

17
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,320
What am I supposed to do now?

18
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,679
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

19
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,700
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,740
But it's on a first come first serve basis.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,859
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,459
What are my other options?

23
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,319
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today.

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,260
And you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:16,280
That's fine.

26
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:17,040
I'll do that then.

27
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,760
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,439
I'll book your flight now.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
All right, we're back.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,379
So now it's time for us to go into language takeaway.

31
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,200
Language takeaway.

32
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,760
All right, in language takeaway today, we have about four words or phrases.

33
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,760
The first one is the reason for this cancellation.

34
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,120
The reason is mechanical problems.

35
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:42,780
That's right.

36
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:48,239
She said that the airplane has some mechanical problems and that's why the flight is canceled.

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,120
So the key here is mechanical.

38
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,239
Mechanical, mechanical meaning like related to machines, right?

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,219
All right.

40
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,260
So something that's a mechanical problem has to do with the actual structure of the plane.

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,040
That's right.

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:08,419
So for example, maybe something is wrong with the wings or maybe something is wrong with the engines, some type of problem that has to do with the mechanics of the machine.

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,060
Right.

44
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:15,520
And obviously if you have a problem with the wings or the wheels or the engine, you don't want to fly that plane.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,159
That's right.

46
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,099
So this caused the canceled flight.

47
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,120
Now, after that, we heard this word.

48
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,060
We apologize for any inconveniences.

49
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,840
What's an inconvenience, Marco?

50
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,300
That's right.

51
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,360
Well, obviously, I planned to take this flight, let's say, Tuesday at 8 a.m.

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,300
And if the flight is canceled, that means I have to wait an hour or three hours or maybe for the next day.

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,860
So it's an inconvenience.

54
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,939
It means it's not convenient for me.

55
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,460
It causes me some trouble.

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,259
All right.

57
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,439
So something that is inconvenient causes problems or causes trouble.

58
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,060
That's right.

59
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,419
For example, you have this late flight or canceled flight.

60
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:53,479
That's an inconvenience.

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,699
But also small things can be inconvenient as well, like I want to go home at 5.

62
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,199
Unfortunately, I have to write this report.

63
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,599
It's very inconvenient.

64
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,360
That's right.

65
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,060
So maybe you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 12, but you also have a meeting at your work.

66
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,180
So it's inconvenient, these two dates.

67
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,120
All right.

68
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,780
They cause problems for each other.

69
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,139
So after that, the service person says, if your flight is urgent, I can put you on a waiting list.

70
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:18,819
Right.

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:19,680
Waiting list.

72
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,599
So this is another important phrase to understand when we're talking about canceled flights.

73
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:24,240
That's right.

74
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,020
We usually get put on a waiting list.

75
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:38,180
And it's basically a list with everyone's names where you are waiting for the next available flight or you're waiting to be able to have the service provided.

76
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:38,879
All right.

77
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:45,539
So you can have a waiting list at an airport like here, but you can also have a waiting list at a restaurant, right?

78
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,259
That's right.

79
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,500
And some restaurants are super popular and you've got to get on a waiting list.

80
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,479
So can I put my name on the waiting list?

81
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,620
That means, can you call me when there is a free table?

82
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,159
Right.

83
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:55,900
Exactly.

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:05,620
So even though we are on this waiting list, it doesn't mean that we are guaranteed to be able to take this flight this evening.

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,219
So there is no guarantee.

86
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,000
All right.

87
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:16,839
This guarantee, this is an important thing to talk about because a guarantee is something that means that we will definitely get a later flight.

88
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:17,160
Yeah.

89
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,839
We promise.

90
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:18,759
We promise.

91
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,100
So you often see the word guarantee in advertisements.

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,100
For example, this TV has a six month guarantee, so we guarantee it won't break.

93
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,420
If it does, we will fix it.

94
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,420
But no guarantee means that we can't promise.

95
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,519
We don't promise.

96
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,199
That's right.

97
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,439
So it's possible that you won't get a flight.

98
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,399
So for example, if you buy a new car, the manufacturer will guarantee that it's in good condition and it won't break down.

99
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,019
But if you buy a used car, it's unlikely that they will give you that same guarantee.

100
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:49,639
No, that's right.

101
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,480
They cannot promise it because they don't know.

102
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,100
Exactly.

103
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:52,980
All right.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,639
So a lot of words and phrases there.

105
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,000
Why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue again?

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
Good afternoon, sir.

107
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,939
May I please see your passport and reservation?

108
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:06,839
Here you go.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,699
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,259
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

111
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,199
Canceled?

112
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,439
What am I supposed to do now?

113
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,860
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

114
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:27,899
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first come first serve basis.

115
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,040
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

116
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,660
What are my other options?

117
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:40,420
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

118
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,459
That's fine.

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,240
I'll do that then.

120
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,959
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

121
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,600
I'll book your flight now.

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,800
All right.

123
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,600
So now let's take a look at three key phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

124
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,720
Fluency Builder.

125
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,420
OK, so the first phrase we have here is a very important one.

126
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,160
This tells us about the cause of the problem.

127
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,399
The service person said, I'm sorry, sir.

128
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,360
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems, right?

129
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,839
So this phrase due to basically is saying because of right.

130
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,399
That's right.

131
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,459
So this flight has been canceled because of mechanical problems.

132
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,639
And remember, this do is DUE.

133
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:24,819
That's right.

134
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,620
DUE.

135
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,819
So I think it's kind of a nicer or more formal way of saying because of or the reason is.

136
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,519
Exactly.

137
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,480
For example, the picnic has been canceled due to bad weather.

138
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,579
So it sounds a lot more professional, a lot more formal than if you say because of bad weather.

139
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,259
All right.

140
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,160
So just remember here, due to indicates the cause or the reason.

141
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,160
It's like saying because.

142
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:52,519
All right.

143
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,339
Now, when we were talking about the flights, we said that we are on the waiting list.

144
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:06,819
But in order to catch this flight, they are going to take people on a first come, first served basis.

145
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:07,639
All right.

146
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,220
First come, first served.

147
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,139
Now, this is a this is, again, a very common phrase.

148
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,379
It's related to that waiting list thing we're talking about.

149
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:21,199
If you have a waiting list, usually the waiting list is first come, first served.

150
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,920
So I could say, you know, am I guaranteed a spot?

151
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,420
And you could say, well, it's first come, first served.

152
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,480
Maybe, maybe not.

153
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:30,720
Right.

154
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,839
If I'm number one on the list, I will probably get a seat.

155
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,160
But if I'm number 30, probably, probably not.

156
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,139
So what we mean by it is that we don't give priority to anyone.

157
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
We don't say, oh, you are more important or you're not.

158
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,720
Whoever comes first gets it.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,220
All right.

160
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,660
So if I come to the restaurant at five o'clock, I get to sit sit first.

161
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,879
But if you come at five ten, you're next and after you five thirty.

162
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,959
So it's first come, first serve.

163
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,019
It depends on when you arrive.

164
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,860
That's right.

165
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,420
So obviously, this wasn't convenient for us.

166
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,120
So we are going to wait until tomorrow.

167
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,139
But the airline will put us up in a hotel.

168
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,079
We will put you up in a hotel.

169
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:08,879
All right.

170
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,180
So let's take this as a phrase, because we all know what a hotel is.

171
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,759
It's a place where you stay when you're on holiday or business.

172
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,600
But to put someone up.

173
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,779
What exactly does this mean?

174
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,959
Basically, you are paying for that person to stay at that hotel.

175
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,980
And you made the reservation and you're going to pay for the room.

176
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,040
So I will put you up means I will pay for your room at a hotel.

177
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,620
Right.

178
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,480
And it's usually only for accommodation for a hotel.

179
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,320
You can say I will put you up for a meal.

180
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:43,200
No, but you can say I'll put you up at my house, which means I will let you stay the night at my house.

181
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,759
So not food, but actually sleeping done right.

182
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,039
So it usually involves sleeping.

183
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:48,799
That's right.

184
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:55,080
So, for example, you could say he's he's coming to our hometown for the wedding.

185
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,639
I will put him up at my house.

186
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:03,820
Or if your company sent you to Japan, you say my company put me up at the Hyatt Hotel.

187
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:04,580
Oh, fancy.

188
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,080
Nice.

189
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:05,899
All right.

190
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:07,919
So that's all the phrases we have for you.

191
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:10,399
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

192
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Good afternoon, sir.

193
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,059
May I please see your passport and reservation?

194
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,980
Here you go.

195
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,820
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

196
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,379
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

197
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,299
Canceled?

198
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,580
What am I supposed to do now?

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,980
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

200
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,019
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first come first serve basis.

201
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,159
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

202
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,720
What are my other options?

203
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,559
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

204
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,559
That's fine.

205
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,340
I'll do that then.

206
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,080
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

207
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,759
I'll book your flight now.

208
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,480
All right, we're back.

209
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,399
So we're talking about canceled flights.

210
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,440
Usually it's due to bad weather and usually you can catch another flight soon.

211
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,899
But sometimes you do have these problems like when there was the whole 9-11 thing.

212
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,379
I think a lot of flights were canceled or the volcano that erupted and European flights were grounded for a long time.

213
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,440
Yes, that's right.

214
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,620
So sometimes there are natural disasters.

215
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,039
Sometimes there are man-made disasters.

216
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:31,919
But you actually said a very interesting word there and something that I think people who are learning about this should definitely study.

217
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,480
The word is grounded.

218
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,080
A flight has been grounded.

219
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,519
Yes, that means that the airplane will stay on the ground.

220
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,200
It means the plane will not fly.

221
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:52,200
OK, so when planes are grounded because of bad weather or because of a natural disaster like a volcano, it's a very serious situation because the people who are going to fly can't know.

222
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,500
Now, in our dialogue, we saw that they handled it, the airline handled it very, very well.

223
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,519
But I think this is a very rare case.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
You've had flights canceled before.

225
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:02,320
How did they handle it?

226
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,899
I have.

227
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,419
I've had two or three flights canceled one time because of a blizzard.

228
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,080
So all flights were grounded.

229
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,159
The weather was very bad, very dangerous.

230
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:14,039
And the airline company said, well, we're sorry, there are no more flights.

231
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,320
But if you come back tomorrow, we can help you.

232
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,940
And I was very lucky because they did not give me a hope.

233
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,279
They did.

234
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,299
They did not put me up in a hotel.

235
00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:23,919
But I was staying with a friend.

236
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,840
So my friends put me up at her house.

237
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,220
But the other time the flight was canceled.

238
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,360
The airline put me on a flight from another company, another airline company.

239
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,539
And so sometimes they can do that where they have they have a relationship with another airline company.

240
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,220
They can do that.

241
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:43,080
So usually they do try to handle it relatively well.

242
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:50,539
But I've heard sometimes that they are not very understanding or very sympathetic to the inconvenience they cause.

243
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,159
Definitely.

244
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:59,360
And I think the worst is when it's bad weather because everyone's angry and all the customers need to go somewhere, but they can't because there are no flights.

245
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,379
And so the people who are working for the airlines get very frustrated or upset.

246
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,639
Because basically it's not their fault.

247
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,980
It's not their fault there's bad weather.

248
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,440
So there's there's not really much compensation the company can give you.

249
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:12,440
No, definitely not.

250
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,299
Not really their fault.

251
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,799
But it's hard not to get frustrated because you want to go home.

252
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,700
You're tired.

253
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,200
You don't want to pay for another night in a hotel.

254
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,580
So I can understand both sides.

255
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,299
Well, it's an interesting topic.

256
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:30,539
And I'm sure many of our listeners who have traveled have had a flight delayed or canceled.

257
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,559

All right.

Bye, guys.
