00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And today we have a great lesson for you about traveling.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You know, we have taken a look at previous lessons where you can buy a ticket, how to book a flight, what to do at the airport.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But now we are going to see what we can do if our flight gets canceled.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, this is not a fun situation.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But hopefully with our help, you'll be able to understand what these messages are about flights that are canceled or delayed.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good afternoon, sir.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
May I please see your passport and reservation?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Here you go.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Canceled?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What am I supposed to do now?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But it's on a first come first serve basis.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What are my other options?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's fine.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll do that then.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll book your flight now.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All right, we're back.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So now it's time for us to go into language takeaway.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Language takeaway.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right, in language takeaway today, we have about four words or phrases.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The first one is the reason for this cancellation.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The reason is mechanical problems.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She said that the airplane has some mechanical problems and that's why the flight is canceled.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So the key here is mechanical.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mechanical, mechanical meaning like related to machines, right?

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All right.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So something that's a mechanical problem has to do with the actual structure of the plane.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So for example, maybe something is wrong with the wings or maybe something is wrong with the engines, some type of problem that has to do with the mechanics of the machine.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Right.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And obviously if you have a problem with the wings or the wheels or the engine, you don't want to fly that plane.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So this caused the canceled flight.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, after that, we heard this word.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We apologize for any inconveniences.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's an inconvenience, Marco?

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, obviously, I planned to take this flight, let's say, Tuesday at 8 a.m.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And if the flight is canceled, that means I have to wait an hour or three hours or maybe for the next day.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it's an inconvenience.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It means it's not convenient for me.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It causes me some trouble.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So something that is inconvenient causes problems or causes trouble.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
For example, you have this late flight or canceled flight.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's an inconvenience.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But also small things can be inconvenient as well, like I want to go home at 5.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Unfortunately, I have to write this report.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's very inconvenient.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So maybe you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 12, but you also have a meeting at your work.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it's inconvenient, these two dates.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They cause problems for each other.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So after that, the service person says, if your flight is urgent, I can put you on a waiting list.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Right.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Waiting list.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So this is another important phrase to understand when we're talking about canceled flights.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We usually get put on a waiting list.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And it's basically a list with everyone's names where you are waiting for the next available flight or you're waiting to be able to have the service provided.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So you can have a waiting list at an airport like here, but you can also have a waiting list at a restaurant, right?

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And some restaurants are super popular and you've got to get on a waiting list.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So can I put my name on the waiting list?

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That means, can you call me when there is a free table?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Exactly.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So even though we are on this waiting list, it doesn't mean that we are guaranteed to be able to take this flight this evening.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So there is no guarantee.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All right.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This guarantee, this is an important thing to talk about because a guarantee is something that means that we will definitely get a later flight.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We promise.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We promise.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So you often see the word guarantee in advertisements.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
For example, this TV has a six month guarantee, so we guarantee it won't break.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If it does, we will fix it.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But no guarantee means that we can't promise.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We don't promise.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So it's possible that you won't get a flight.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So for example, if you buy a new car, the manufacturer will guarantee that it's in good condition and it won't break down.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But if you buy a used car, it's unlikely that they will give you that same guarantee.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, that's right.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They cannot promise it because they don't know.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Exactly.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
All right.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So a lot of words and phrases there.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue again?

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good afternoon, sir.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
May I please see your passport and reservation?

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Here you go.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Canceled?

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What am I supposed to do now?

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first come first serve basis.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are my other options?

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's fine.

119
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll do that then.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll book your flight now.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So now let's take a look at three key phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Fluency Builder.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
OK, so the first phrase we have here is a very important one.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This tells us about the cause of the problem.

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The service person said, I'm sorry, sir.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems, right?

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So this phrase due to basically is saying because of right.

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So this flight has been canceled because of mechanical problems.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And remember, this do is DUE.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
DUE.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So I think it's kind of a nicer or more formal way of saying because of or the reason is.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Exactly.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
For example, the picnic has been canceled due to bad weather.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So it sounds a lot more professional, a lot more formal than if you say because of bad weather.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All right.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So just remember here, due to indicates the cause or the reason.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's like saying because.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
All right.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now, when we were talking about the flights, we said that we are on the waiting list.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But in order to catch this flight, they are going to take people on a first come, first served basis.

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
All right.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
First come, first served.

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, this is a this is, again, a very common phrase.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's related to that waiting list thing we're talking about.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you have a waiting list, usually the waiting list is first come, first served.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So I could say, you know, am I guaranteed a spot?

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And you could say, well, it's first come, first served.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Maybe, maybe not.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right.

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If I'm number one on the list, I will probably get a seat.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But if I'm number 30, probably, probably not.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So what we mean by it is that we don't give priority to anyone.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We don't say, oh, you are more important or you're not.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Whoever comes first gets it.

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
All right.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So if I come to the restaurant at five o'clock, I get to sit sit first.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But if you come at five ten, you're next and after you five thirty.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it's first come, first serve.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It depends on when you arrive.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's right.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So obviously, this wasn't convenient for us.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So we are going to wait until tomorrow.

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But the airline will put us up in a hotel.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We will put you up in a hotel.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
All right.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So let's take this as a phrase, because we all know what a hotel is.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's a place where you stay when you're on holiday or business.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But to put someone up.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What exactly does this mean?

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Basically, you are paying for that person to stay at that hotel.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And you made the reservation and you're going to pay for the room.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So I will put you up means I will pay for your room at a hotel.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And it's usually only for accommodation for a hotel.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can say I will put you up for a meal.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, but you can say I'll put you up at my house, which means I will let you stay the night at my house.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So not food, but actually sleeping done right.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So it usually involves sleeping.

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, for example, you could say he's he's coming to our hometown for the wedding.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I will put him up at my house.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or if your company sent you to Japan, you say my company put me up at the Hyatt Hotel.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, fancy.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Nice.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All right.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So that's all the phrases we have for you.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Good afternoon, sir.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
May I please see your passport and reservation?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Here you go.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Canceled?

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What am I supposed to do now?

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first come first serve basis.

201
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What are my other options?

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's fine.

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll do that then.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll book your flight now.

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
All right, we're back.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So we're talking about canceled flights.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Usually it's due to bad weather and usually you can catch another flight soon.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But sometimes you do have these problems like when there was the whole 9-11 thing.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I think a lot of flights were canceled or the volcano that erupted and European flights were grounded for a long time.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes, that's right.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So sometimes there are natural disasters.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sometimes there are man-made disasters.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But you actually said a very interesting word there and something that I think people who are learning about this should definitely study.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The word is grounded.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A flight has been grounded.

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, that means that the airplane will stay on the ground.

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It means the plane will not fly.

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:52,000
OK, so when planes are grounded because of bad weather or because of a natural disaster like a volcano, it's a very serious situation because the people who are going to fly can't know.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Now, in our dialogue, we saw that they handled it, the airline handled it very, very well.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But I think this is a very rare case.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You've had flights canceled before.

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
How did they handle it?

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have.

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I've had two or three flights canceled one time because of a blizzard.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So all flights were grounded.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The weather was very bad, very dangerous.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And the airline company said, well, we're sorry, there are no more flights.

231
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But if you come back tomorrow, we can help you.

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I was very lucky because they did not give me a hope.

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They did.

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They did not put me up in a hotel.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But I was staying with a friend.

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So my friends put me up at her house.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But the other time the flight was canceled.

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The airline put me on a flight from another company, another airline company.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And so sometimes they can do that where they have they have a relationship with another airline company.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They can do that.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So usually they do try to handle it relatively well.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But I've heard sometimes that they are not very understanding or very sympathetic to the inconvenience they cause.

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Definitely.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And I think the worst is when it's bad weather because everyone's angry and all the customers need to go somewhere, but they can't because there are no flights.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And so the people who are working for the airlines get very frustrated or upset.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because basically it's not their fault.

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's not their fault there's bad weather.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So there's there's not really much compensation the company can give you.

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, definitely not.

250
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Not really their fault.

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But it's hard not to get frustrated because you want to go home.

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're tired.

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You don't want to pay for another night in a hotel.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So I can understand both sides.

255
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, it's an interesting topic.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I'm sure many of our listeners who have traveled have had a flight delayed or canceled.

257
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000

All right.

Bye, guys.
