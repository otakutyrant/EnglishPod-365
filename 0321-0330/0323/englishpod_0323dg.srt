1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:06,860
EnglishPod.com Good afternoon, sir.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,220
May I please see your passport and reservation?

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,140
Here you go.

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,089
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,480
Canceled?

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,760
What am I supposed to do now?

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,140
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:34,340
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,880
What are my other options?

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,719
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today, and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,719
That's fine.

13
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:45,500
I'll do that then.

14
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,240
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

15
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:48,719
I'll book your flight now.
