1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
EnglishPod.com Good afternoon, sir.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
May I please see your passport and reservation?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here you go.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This flight has been canceled due to some mechanical problems.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Canceled?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What am I supposed to do now?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We apologize for any inconveniences that may be caused by this.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If your flight is urgent, I could put you on a waiting list for another flight this evening, but it's on a first-come, first-serve basis, so there's no guarantee you'll be able to take that flight.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are my other options?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, if you can wait until tomorrow, we will put you up in a hotel for today, and you can take the scheduled flight for tomorrow morning.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's fine.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll do that then.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you for your understanding, sir.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll book your flight now.
