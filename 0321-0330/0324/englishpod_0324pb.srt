00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're celebrating a very important and very special American holiday.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we are celebrating and talking about Thanksgiving, a very, as you say, traditional and big holiday in the United States.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So this year it's on November 25th.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's always on a Thursday.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's check out our dialogue to hear about what happens at this special dinner and why this is a holiday.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then we'll be back to talk about it in just a moment.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Not much, really.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's more of an American tradition.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So back home, we don't really celebrate it.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, you know, it's a time to get together with all of your family and be thankful for everything.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Once in the New World, they befriended the native named Squanto, who taught them how to harvest food from the area, such as corn.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then what happened?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter, and in celebration, they decided to have a big feast with the natives, giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health, and new lives.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Interesting.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Come to my house for Thanksgiving.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy and lots of stuffing.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Count me in.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So a very interesting holiday.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We learned a little bit about why it celebrated, how it came to be.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So let's take a look at some of those words now on language takeaway.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Language takeaway.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The first word we have for you guys today on language takeaway is settler.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, a settler is a person.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What kind of a person is a settler?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Basically, it's a person that goes to a place to settle down there or to settle there.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And that basically means to live there, to stay there permanently.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All right.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But the idea with a settler is that he or she will start to build something, build a house, build a city, build a town.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So settlers go to places where there aren't very many people.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Kind of hard to be a settler now.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But yeah, back then, obviously, there were so many places that were undiscovered or didn't have people and they would settle there.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And the place where they went in the United States is called Massachusetts.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Massachusetts.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, this is a very long, very hard to pronounce the word, and I believe it comes from a local Indian language, but Massachusetts, if you break it down, Massachusetts is a state.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And you might have heard of the biggest city in Massachusetts, which is Boston.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So Boston, Massachusetts.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But this is where the settlers first came when they came to America.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So I think if you go to Boston, it has kind of this atmosphere of, you know, of the settlers and how this old little touch to it of how it used to be right.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There is an old feel to Boston, because unlike most places in America, Boston has been has been a city for over 400 years, almost 500 years.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So it's much different from places like California or Texas.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
OK, so the settlers arrived to Massachusetts and they went there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OK, so the key here is persecution.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is something that you do to someone else, or this is something a government does to someone else.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Basically to persecute someone is to is to limit them or to attack them or to to prevent them from doing things that they want to do.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So basically, that is the reason why they left England, because the king was persecuting them.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They didn't let them be have their own religion.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They had this religion and the king did not approve of the religion and they felt like people were critical of them or attacking them or preventing them from practicing this religion.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And so their religious persecution in England pushed them to this place, the New World.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So that's our next word, right?

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The New World.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And this is what they used to call the continent of United States or North America.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They used to call it the New World.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So New World, Old World.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So if we think of Europe as being the Old World, America, like you're saying, Latin America, North America, these are part of the New World.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So it's almost like they had never been discovered before.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, yeah, basically everyone was concentrated in Europe at that time.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And then when they went to the West, they went to the New World.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And obviously, when they arrived, it wasn't empty.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They had people there.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And we say that they are the natives of that land.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
OK.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So a native of some place is someone who comes from there originally.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So if I came to America in 1500, there were Native American Indians who were living there.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And so they're the natives of this place.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now, can you use that nowadays?

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Can you say, I am a native of Italy?

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm a native of Italy.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm a native of Chicago.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, you can.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a little bit, you know, it's a little bit less common than saying I'm from Chicago or I'm from Italy.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But it's also correct.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
OK.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But in this case, we're talking about the natives as the people who were already there.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Native American Indians.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like Squanto.

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Like Squanto.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's the name of that Native American Indian who was there.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And this native named Squanto taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So this is the interesting part of the story.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It is.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Basically, these two groups worked together.

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You have Native American Indians and settlers.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And they worked together to make a meal and to survive, basically.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And to harvest food, to harvest, the key here is that it's a verb.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's something you do to crops or like corn or potatoes.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And you take them out from the field and you bring them home.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So in this case, the corn is growing out of the land.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And if you go out and cut it down and take it, you are harvesting corn.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You are you're collecting it.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And and so they harvested the food and they have a very big meal.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So we do want to talk about the special meal here that features all of this harvested food.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's take a look at some of those words in Language Takeaway Part 2.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So talking about the foods.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, obviously, the tradition is that you have this big meal together.

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And the one thing that is, I think, a given is that you have a big turkey.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's right.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So a turkey is a bird.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Mm hmm.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They make very funny sounds.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't they?

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Right.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Like gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But they they're very big.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They run around and they have this red part under their their neck and beaks and everything.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So it's a very commonly eaten food for Thanksgiving, but people can eat it any time.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is a weird thing.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I usually don't see turkey too much, if not during Thanksgiving.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Like I don't see somebody like a restaurant offering turkey.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, you don't.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But you do see it in delis like a roast turkey sandwich because turkey is very healthy.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
OK.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So we have turkey.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We also have pumpkin pie.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So pumpkin pie.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Pumpkin pie.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is a classic.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You've heard of apple pie.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
All right.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But pumpkin pie is a baked dessert that is filled with some pumpkin filling.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mm hmm.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So as you know, pumpkin or may know, pumpkin is a big.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a gourd.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a gourd.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Kind of vegetable.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Kind of like a vegetable.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's big and orange.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And basically, this is a it's kind of sweet.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Right.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The insides.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It is.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's a little bit sweet.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's big, orange and round.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Like you say, people often start to harvest them around October and October, I'd say.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Some people like to eat the seeds, but you can also scoop out with your spoon.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can take out some of the meat, some of the filling, the filling.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that's what we use to create this pumpkin pie.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Very good.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So pumpkin pie.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Delicious food.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Now we also have a typical mashed potatoes with gravy.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All right.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I love mashed potatoes.

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Mashed means to squish or to break down or to push down.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And so mashed potatoes, you have a normal potato and you mix up all the potatoes together.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So it's kind of like soft and creamy.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It almost becomes like a paste or almost like let's say like ice cream, but not cold.

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Not cold and not sweet.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But yeah, that's the consistency.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's what it feels like.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And so when we eat potatoes like this in America, we often like to eat it with a sauce.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And the sauce that we eat with mashed potatoes is called gravy.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Gravy.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Gravy.

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And now gravy is usually made out of what?

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Gravy is made from, well, you can make different kinds of gravy, but the way that we make it at my house is we take all of the juice from the turkey because when you bake a turkey in the oven, on the bottom of the pan, you'll get some liquid, some water, some fat.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And you use that to make a gravy.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Gravy.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So it's brown and it's very salty and delicious.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Awesome.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sounds delicious.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And to end things, we have stuffing.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Now this stuffing goes inside the turkey, right?

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But then you take it out.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So stuffing, we talk about stuffing in general as being something that you put inside something else.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So if I have a stuffed animal, he has some cotton inside or whatever.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But if you have a turkey, you take out all of the organs, the heart, the liver.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You take those parts out because we don't eat those.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And you put some bread, onions, and vegetables inside the turkey to cook, and then you take it out and you eat it.

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So it tastes a bit like turkey and meat, but it's very delicious.

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But you eat it apart, kind of like, let's say, rice or something.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's like a side dish.

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like a side dish.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It sounds delicious.

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And obviously, it's a very big meal, but very, very common, a traditional holiday in the United States.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's very fun to celebrate as well.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You get together with family and you have this nice meal together.

203
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's right.

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a wonderful holiday.

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And we'll be talking a bit about it in a second.

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But let's just take one more listen to today's dialogue.

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

208
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Not much, really.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's more of an American tradition.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So back home, we don't really celebrate it.

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, you know, it's a time to get together with all of your family and be thankful for everything.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Once in the New World, they befriended a native named Squanto, who taught them how to harvest food from the area, such as corn.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And then what happened?

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter.

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And in celebration, they decided to have a big feast with the natives, giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health and new lives.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Interesting.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Come to my house for Thanksgiving.

222
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy and lots of stuffing.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Count me in.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
All right.

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So Thanksgiving is a national holiday now, is it?

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You say it's on a Thursday.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's always on Thursday.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So you get that Thursday off from school, from work and everything.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You get Thursday and Friday.

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, you get two days.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, it's a four-day weekend.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, nice.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And it's a wonderful holiday because it's something that everybody in America can celebrate.

234
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Because you know, for Christmas, for example, some people don't celebrate Christmas.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or you don't really get holiday time off during the summer for everyone, maybe just the schoolchildren.

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And so this is actually a nice holiday because everybody is home.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Right.

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So it doesn't have a religious connotation because you're talking about the settlers and how they arrived there and they survived a harsh winter.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And so as you say, it's kind of like a neutral holiday where it's a good excuse to get together, have a big meal and just spend quality time with the family.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's right.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You cook all day.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You eat.

243
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You watch some football on TV.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You spend some time with your family and you fall asleep very, very full.

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So this is another very interesting thing is that usually on TV, because everyone is home, everyone is having dinner or spending time with each other, they will have a football game on TV for Thanksgiving.

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's right.

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So everyone's sitting around eating dinner and then there's a football game on the TV.

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Wow.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So that's kind of bad for the football players that have to be playing on Thanksgiving Day.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, but they get all hungry out there on the field and then they get to go home and eat a big turkey.

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And have a big meal.

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's very, very interesting.

253
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We'll put some pictures of the food that is commonly served on this holiday.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it would be interesting to know if, I know a lot of our listeners are not originally from the United States, so if you are there, tell us if you've celebrated it or have you seen it or will you celebrate it or any story that you can share with us.

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's right.

256
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We are very excited to hear this from you and we wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving.

257
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Visit our site, EnglishPod.com, to tell us more.

258
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000

259
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We'll see you guys there.

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Bye.

261
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Bye.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Bye.
