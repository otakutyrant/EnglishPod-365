00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,899
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,660
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:08,900
And today we're celebrating a very important and very special American holiday.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,759
That's right.

6
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:18,679
Today we are celebrating and talking about Thanksgiving, a very, as you say, traditional and big holiday in the United States.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,320
That's right.

8
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:21,780
So this year it's on November 25th.

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,000
It's always on a Thursday.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,500
Let's check out our dialogue to hear about what happens at this special dinner and why this is a holiday.

11
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,800
And then we'll be back to talk about it in just a moment.

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,359
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,920
Not much, really.

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,500
It's more of an American tradition.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,759
So back home, we don't really celebrate it.

16
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,299
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:55,579
Well, you know, it's a time to get together with all of your family and be thankful for everything.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

19
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:05,040
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,519
Once in the New World, they befriended the native named Squanto, who taught them how to harvest food from the area, such as corn.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,079
And then what happened?

22
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:21,319
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter, and in celebration, they decided to have a big feast with the natives, giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health, and new lives.

23
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,319
Interesting.

24
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:26,239
I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,879
Come to my house for Thanksgiving.

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,420
We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy and lots of stuffing.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,640
Count me in.

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,060
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,480
So a very interesting holiday.

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,980
We learned a little bit about why it celebrated, how it came to be.

31
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:49,219
So let's take a look at some of those words now on language takeaway.

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
Language takeaway.

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,159
The first word we have for you guys today on language takeaway is settler.

34
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,659
Now, a settler is a person.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,299
What kind of a person is a settler?

36
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,659
Basically, it's a person that goes to a place to settle down there or to settle there.

37
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,919
And that basically means to live there, to stay there permanently.

38
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:13,900
All right.

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:21,219
But the idea with a settler is that he or she will start to build something, build a house, build a city, build a town.

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,060
So settlers go to places where there aren't very many people.

41
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:25,719
That's right.

42
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,539
Kind of hard to be a settler now.

43
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:34,199
But yeah, back then, obviously, there were so many places that were undiscovered or didn't have people and they would settle there.

44
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:39,620
And the place where they went in the United States is called Massachusetts.

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,400
Massachusetts.

46
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:53,319
Now, this is a very long, very hard to pronounce the word, and I believe it comes from a local Indian language, but Massachusetts, if you break it down, Massachusetts is a state.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,800
And you might have heard of the biggest city in Massachusetts, which is Boston.

48
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,620
So Boston, Massachusetts.

49
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,680
But this is where the settlers first came when they came to America.

50
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,400
That's right.

51
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:15,599
So I think if you go to Boston, it has kind of this atmosphere of, you know, of the settlers and how this old little touch to it of how it used to be right.

52
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:25,379
There is an old feel to Boston, because unlike most places in America, Boston has been has been a city for over 400 years, almost 500 years.

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,039
So it's much different from places like California or Texas.

54
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,219
That's right.

55
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:39,759
OK, so the settlers arrived to Massachusetts and they went there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

56
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,379
OK, so the key here is persecution.

57
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:48,099
This is something that you do to someone else, or this is something a government does to someone else.

58
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:59,000
Basically to persecute someone is to is to limit them or to attack them or to to prevent them from doing things that they want to do.

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,639
That's right.

60
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,620
So basically, that is the reason why they left England, because the king was persecuting them.

61
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,080
They didn't let them be have their own religion.

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,699
Right.

63
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:17,000
They had this religion and the king did not approve of the religion and they felt like people were critical of them or attacking them or preventing them from practicing this religion.

64
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,959
And so their religious persecution in England pushed them to this place, the New World.

65
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,639
So that's our next word, right?

66
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,240
That's right.

67
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,180
The New World.

68
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:32,920
And this is what they used to call the continent of United States or North America.

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,459
They used to call it the New World.

70
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,779
So New World, Old World.

72
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:46,420
So if we think of Europe as being the Old World, America, like you're saying, Latin America, North America, these are part of the New World.

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,620
So it's almost like they had never been discovered before.

74
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,439
So, yeah, basically everyone was concentrated in Europe at that time.

75
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,399
And then when they went to the West, they went to the New World.

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,360
And obviously, when they arrived, it wasn't empty.

77
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,899
They had people there.

78
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:05,360
And we say that they are the natives of that land.

79
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:05,920
OK.

80
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,019
So a native of some place is someone who comes from there originally.

81
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,120
All right.

82
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:16,980
So if I came to America in 1500, there were Native American Indians who were living there.

83
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,800
And so they're the natives of this place.

84
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,240
Now, can you use that nowadays?

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,879
Can you say, I am a native of Italy?

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,439
I'm a native of Italy.

87
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,699
I'm a native of Chicago.

88
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,480
Yes, you can.

89
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,939
It's a little bit, you know, it's a little bit less common than saying I'm from Chicago or I'm from Italy.

90
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:34,139
But it's also correct.

91
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,519
OK.

92
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:39,279
But in this case, we're talking about the natives as the people who were already there.

93
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,920
Native American Indians.

94
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,459
Like Squanto.

95
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,300
Like Squanto.

96
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,620
That's the name of that Native American Indian who was there.

97
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:52,079
And this native named Squanto taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.

98
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,639
So this is the interesting part of the story.

99
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:54,139
It is.

100
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,459
Basically, these two groups worked together.

101
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,839
You have Native American Indians and settlers.

102
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,680
And they worked together to make a meal and to survive, basically.

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,100
And to harvest food, to harvest, the key here is that it's a verb.

104
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,899
It's something you do to crops or like corn or potatoes.

105
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,019
And you take them out from the field and you bring them home.

106
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:21,420
So in this case, the corn is growing out of the land.

107
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,160
And if you go out and cut it down and take it, you are harvesting corn.

108
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,439
You are you're collecting it.

109
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,040
Exactly.

110
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,740
And and so they harvested the food and they have a very big meal.

111
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,060
So we do want to talk about the special meal here that features all of this harvested food.

112
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,360
Let's take a look at some of those words in Language Takeaway Part 2.

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:41,839
All right.

114
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,379
So talking about the foods.

115
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,339
Now, obviously, the tradition is that you have this big meal together.

116
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:53,040
And the one thing that is, I think, a given is that you have a big turkey.

117
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:53,879
That's right.

118
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,019
So a turkey is a bird.

119
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:55,680
Mm hmm.

120
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:57,019
They make very funny sounds.

121
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,439
Don't they?

122
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:57,740
Right.

123
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,259
Like gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

124
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,300
But they they're very big.

125
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,819
They run around and they have this red part under their their neck and beaks and everything.

126
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,360
So it's a very commonly eaten food for Thanksgiving, but people can eat it any time.

127
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:12,740
Yeah.

128
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,699
This is a weird thing.

129
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,160
I usually don't see turkey too much, if not during Thanksgiving.

130
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,519
Like I don't see somebody like a restaurant offering turkey.

131
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:22,699
No, you don't.

132
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,680
But you do see it in delis like a roast turkey sandwich because turkey is very healthy.

133
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:28,639
OK.

134
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
So we have turkey.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,680
We also have pumpkin pie.

136
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,060
So pumpkin pie.

137
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:35,180
Pumpkin pie.

138
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,980
This is a classic.

139
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,240
You've heard of apple pie.

140
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:37,860
All right.

141
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,740
But pumpkin pie is a baked dessert that is filled with some pumpkin filling.

142
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,540
Mm hmm.

143
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:47,839
So as you know, pumpkin or may know, pumpkin is a big.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,720
It's a gourd.

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,759
It's a gourd.

146
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,019
Yeah.

147
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,180
Kind of vegetable.

148
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,399
Kind of like a vegetable.

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,199
It's big and orange.

150
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,879
And basically, this is a it's kind of sweet.

151
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,220
Right.

152
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,199
The insides.

153
00:07:59,199 --> 00:07:59,920
It is.

154
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,040
It's a little bit sweet.

155
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,279
It's big, orange and round.

156
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:08,639
Like you say, people often start to harvest them around October and October, I'd say.

157
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,339
Some people like to eat the seeds, but you can also scoop out with your spoon.

158
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,980
You can take out some of the meat, some of the filling, the filling.

159
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,379
And that's what we use to create this pumpkin pie.

160
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:20,300
Very good.

161
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,399
So pumpkin pie.

162
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,600
Delicious food.

163
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,100
Now we also have a typical mashed potatoes with gravy.

164
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,439
All right.

165
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,459
I love mashed potatoes.

166
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,379
Mashed means to squish or to break down or to push down.

167
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,820
And so mashed potatoes, you have a normal potato and you mix up all the potatoes together.

168
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,759
So it's kind of like soft and creamy.

169
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:41,299
Yeah.

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,500
It almost becomes like a paste or almost like let's say like ice cream, but not cold.

171
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,000
Not cold and not sweet.

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,659
But yeah, that's the consistency.

173
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,659
That's what it feels like.

174
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:57,039
And so when we eat potatoes like this in America, we often like to eat it with a sauce.

175
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,960
And the sauce that we eat with mashed potatoes is called gravy.

176
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:01,700
Gravy.

177
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:02,120
Gravy.

178
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,600
And now gravy is usually made out of what?

179
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:19,779
Gravy is made from, well, you can make different kinds of gravy, but the way that we make it at my house is we take all of the juice from the turkey because when you bake a turkey in the oven, on the bottom of the pan, you'll get some liquid, some water, some fat.

180
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
And you use that to make a gravy.

181
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:22,860
Gravy.

182
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,179
So it's brown and it's very salty and delicious.

183
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:26,860
Awesome.

184
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:27,879
Sounds delicious.

185
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,519
And to end things, we have stuffing.

186
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,639
Now this stuffing goes inside the turkey, right?

187
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:35,360
But then you take it out.

188
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,279
That's right.

189
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:41,860
So stuffing, we talk about stuffing in general as being something that you put inside something else.

190
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,639
So if I have a stuffed animal, he has some cotton inside or whatever.

191
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,500
But if you have a turkey, you take out all of the organs, the heart, the liver.

192
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,879
You take those parts out because we don't eat those.

193
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:59,860
And you put some bread, onions, and vegetables inside the turkey to cook, and then you take it out and you eat it.

194
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,200
So it tastes a bit like turkey and meat, but it's very delicious.

195
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,100
But you eat it apart, kind of like, let's say, rice or something.

196
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,539
It's like a side dish.

197
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:08,379
Like a side dish.

198
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,460
All right.

199
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,580
It sounds delicious.

200
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:18,399
And obviously, it's a very big meal, but very, very common, a traditional holiday in the United States.

201
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:20,399
It's very fun to celebrate as well.

202
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,080
You get together with family and you have this nice meal together.

203
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,860
That's right.

204
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,100
It's a wonderful holiday.

205
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,340
And we'll be talking a bit about it in a second.

206
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,460
But let's just take one more listen to today's dialogue.

207
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,840
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

208
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:41,379
Not much, really.

209
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,980
It's more of an American tradition.

210
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,240
So back home, we don't really celebrate it.

211
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,759
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

212
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:54,100
Well, you know, it's a time to get together with all of your family and be thankful for everything.

213
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,360
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,519
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

215
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Once in the New World, they befriended a native named Squanto, who taught them how to harvest food from the area, such as corn.

216
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,559
And then what happened?

217
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,940
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter.

218
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:19,799
And in celebration, they decided to have a big feast with the natives, giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health and new lives.

219
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,740
Interesting.

220
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,700
I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

221
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,360
Come to my house for Thanksgiving.

222
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:30,879
We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy and lots of stuffing.

223
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,200
Count me in.

224
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,039
All right.

225
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,460
So Thanksgiving is a national holiday now, is it?

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,580
You say it's on a Thursday.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,360
It's always on Thursday.

228
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,059
So you get that Thursday off from school, from work and everything.

229
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,679
You get Thursday and Friday.

230
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,519
Oh, you get two days.

231
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,799
Yeah, it's a four-day weekend.

232
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,419
Oh, nice.

233
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,919
And it's a wonderful holiday because it's something that everybody in America can celebrate.

234
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,700
Because you know, for Christmas, for example, some people don't celebrate Christmas.

235
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:07,159
Or you don't really get holiday time off during the summer for everyone, maybe just the schoolchildren.

236
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,000
And so this is actually a nice holiday because everybody is home.

237
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,460
Right.

238
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:19,559
So it doesn't have a religious connotation because you're talking about the settlers and how they arrived there and they survived a harsh winter.

239
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:29,080
And so as you say, it's kind of like a neutral holiday where it's a good excuse to get together, have a big meal and just spend quality time with the family.

240
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,460
That's right.

241
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,320
You cook all day.

242
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:31,179
You eat.

243
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,320
You watch some football on TV.

244
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,679
You spend some time with your family and you fall asleep very, very full.

245
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:50,940
So this is another very interesting thing is that usually on TV, because everyone is home, everyone is having dinner or spending time with each other, they will have a football game on TV for Thanksgiving.

246
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:51,840
That's right.

247
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,379
So everyone's sitting around eating dinner and then there's a football game on the TV.

248
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:55,960
Wow.

249
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:01,059
So that's kind of bad for the football players that have to be playing on Thanksgiving Day.

250
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, but they get all hungry out there on the field and then they get to go home and eat a big turkey.

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,840
And have a big meal.

252
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,299
It's very, very interesting.

253
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:12,360
We'll put some pictures of the food that is commonly served on this holiday.

254
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:25,600
And it would be interesting to know if, I know a lot of our listeners are not originally from the United States, so if you are there, tell us if you've celebrated it or have you seen it or will you celebrate it or any story that you can share with us.

255
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,320
That's right.

256
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:30,120
We are very excited to hear this from you and we wish you all a very happy Thanksgiving.

257
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,740

258
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:33,100

We'll see you guys there.

260
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:33,960
Bye.

261
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:34,240
Bye.

262
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
Bye.
