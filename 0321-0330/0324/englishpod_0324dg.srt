00:00:04,479 --> 00:00:10,599
So, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,179
Not much, really.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,000
It's more of an American tradition, so back home we don't really celebrate it.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,579
In fact, I'm not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,839
Well, you know, it's a time to get together with all of your family and be thankful for everything.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,219
Yeah, but how did this holiday come to be?

7
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:34,320
Well, the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,820
Once in the New World, they befriended a native named Squanto who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn.

9
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,359
And then what happened?

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:50,600
Well, they had enough harvest for the next winter, and in celebration they decided to have a big feast with the natives, giving thanks to the land and everyone for their food, health, and new lives.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,579
Interesting.

12
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,520
I am amazed how big and delicious Thanksgiving dinners are.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,159
Come to my house for Thanksgiving.

14
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:01,700
We're having turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes with gravy, and lots of stuffing.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,859
Count me in!
