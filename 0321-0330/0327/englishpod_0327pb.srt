00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,620
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,480
My name is Catherine and today we're going shopping for something.

3
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,039
What are we going shopping for, Marco?

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:17,280
That's right, today we are buying pants and we're gonna try to see if we find a good pair of jeans.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,179
Yeah, sometimes pants are too small, sometimes they're too big, let's try and find the right pair today.

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,100
Excuse me, can I try on this pair of jeans?

7
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,100
Sure, let me see.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,859
I'm afraid we don't have any size 8s left.

9
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,619
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,380
I'm always a size 4.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,420
Here, I'll try these.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,979
They seem a bit too tight, shall I find you a larger size?

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,040
No, they fit fine.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,239
They show off my curves perfectly.

15
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,920
Yeah, your love handles.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,359
Yes, they sure do, although, here, you forgot to close this button.

17
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,099
Yeah, right, I'll do it now.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,739
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:38,840
Language Takeaway Alright, so today on Language Takeaway the first phrase we have is actually a verbal phrase.

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,500
Because this is what we do when we go to find some clothes, we try on those clothes.

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:56,920
That's right, so that is a, as you said, a verbal phrase and to try on a pair of pants or to try on some clothes is to put them on and see if they are okay, if they're the right size.

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,519
That's right, so if I'm in the store and I see a shirt that I really like, I go to the dressing room to try it on.

23
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,479
Or you could say, oh my gosh, Marco, come here, this shirt is great, you should try it on.

24
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:23,159
That's right, so you try it on or you try on something, alright, so as we said, we wanted to try on a pair of jeans, so let's take a look at this connection of words, pair of jeans.

25
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:30,680
Alright, so you don't have a jeans, you have a pair of them, and this is because you have not one, but two legs.

26
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,219
So pair means two of something.

27
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:43,960
That's right, so it doesn't mean that you have two pants, right, it doesn't mean that you have two pieces of clothing, it means that you have one piece of clothing that's a pair of jeans.

28
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,080
That's right, so you have one part for one leg and one part for another leg.

29
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,620
The same is true of glasses because, you know, glasses are for your two eyes.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,219
That's right.

31
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,699
So you have a pair of glasses.

32
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,699
That's right, a pair of glasses, a pair of shoes.

33
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,419
Also.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:06,680
Okay, so we are trying on these pair of jeans, but they seem to be a bit too tight.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,780
Alright, so tight is a word we use when something is too small.

36
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,060
It's hard to move if something is too tight.

37
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,080
So maybe if the pants are too small, they might be too tight.

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,939
Yeah, and we often say this, especially to girls, my mom used to say this, oh no, you're not wearing that skirt, it's too tight.

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,719
You can see your body underneath.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,259
Okay, so actually the opposite would be loose if something's too big.

41
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:41,960
Too big, if it's too big it's loose, if it's too small it's tight.

42
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:48,620
Okay, now if it's not too big and not too small, then that means it fits.

43
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,219
It fits, that's right, so I could say, I think I want to buy this pair of jeans, it fits very well.

44
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,620
So if the pants or the pair of jeans fit, it means they are okay for you, they're not too big, not too small.

45
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,400
They're comfortable.

46
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,159
Comfortable.

47
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,919
And in this case she said that they fit perfectly because they show off her curves.

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,139
Now what is she talking about, my curves?

49
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:26,040
Well a curve is something that's not straight, it bends, but when we're talking about a person's curves, we're talking about maybe a woman's hips or her behind, her rear end, or her chest.

50
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:32,000
And so women who have curves maybe are rounder, not flat.

51
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:40,860
So it's something that usually you would use with girls, right, a girl has nice curves.

52
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,839
You wouldn't really say that for a guy, I think.

53
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,399
No, guys you don't really talk about curves.

54
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,920
But with girls, usually you can see someone's curves if she wears tight clothes.

55
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,279
Okay, very good.

56
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,459
So why don't we take a break, let's review all this vocab and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

57
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,240
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm always a size 4.

59
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,019
Here, I'll try these.

60
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,360
They seem a bit too tight.

61
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:40,519
Shall I find you a larger size?

62
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,680
No, they fit fine.

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,839
They show off my curves perfectly.

64
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:47,519
Yeah, your love handles.

65
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,939
They sure do, although here, you forgot to close this button.

66
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:53,399
Yeah, right.

67
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,740
I'll do it now.

68
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,560
Alright, now it's time for three phrases.

69
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,620
Let's take a look at those on Fluency Builder.

70
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,639
Fluency Builder.

71
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,939
Alright, so we heard this phrase here, I'm afraid, and it means something maybe different from what you've heard before.

72
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,839
So the shopkeeper said, I'm afraid we don't have any size 8s left.

73
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,939
That's right, so when you start a sentence like this, you're basically apologizing a little bit, right?

74
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,459
Yeah, it's like saying, I'm sorry, I don't think we have size 8s left.

75
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,000
So maybe I go into the store and I say, well, I would like some chocolate milk, please.

76
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,699
And I say, I'm sorry, I'm afraid we ran out of chocolate milk.

77
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,639
I'm afraid we ran out.

78
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,660
So this means it's too bad or unfortunately we don't have any.

79
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,399
That's right.

80
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,439
So it's not the same being afraid like you're scared.

81
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,300
No, it's not that afraid.

82
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,500
It's a polite way for usually a shopkeeper to say, I'm sorry, we can't help you.

83
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,740
So going back to curves, the girl used this interesting phrasal verb there to show off.

84
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:16,959
All right, so we know the word to show, but to show something off, to show off means to display or exhibit.

85
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,160
It's almost like you want other people to look at you.

86
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:33,339
Okay, so I guess maybe you can see it on the street if someone is in their car and they're playing loud music, kind of drawing attention to their car.

87
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,439
They're kind of showing off their car.

88
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,379
So they want you to see their car or just hear how great sound system they have.

89
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,220
That's right.

90
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,839
Or some women will wear very, very short skirts because they want to show off their long legs.

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,579
That's right.

92
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,040
All right, but now something that you don't really want to show off are your love handles.

93
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,079
All right, now this is a very funny phrase.

94
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,199
It's actually something we say in spoken English that if you say it to someone else might be very rude.

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,019
Love handles are the part of your body above your waist that if you have a little fat, it's like they're squishy.

96
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:11,740
You can touch them.

97
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:25,060
So just think about how maybe people that are a little bit overweight, they put on a pair of pants and on their sides, in their waist, the extra skin that kind of is around the pants.

98
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,180
That's called love handles.

99
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:33,639
And we say love handles because when someone hugs you or they want to hold you, that's where they put their hands.

100
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,720
There's extra to hold on to.

101
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,279
I think sometimes they're even called, they may be called like tires or something like this.

102
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,940
Well, spare tires in the front.

103
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,159
It's near your belly.

104
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,120
All right, so that's called a spare tire.

105
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,039
That's right.

106
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,980
So a spare tire is in the front.

107
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,720
It's a belly.

108
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,440
Normally when people drink a lot of beer, very often they have a spare tire.

109
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,460
But this is actually, love handles are on the sides.

110
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,639
But that's our last word today.

111
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,399
Let's remember that it's not something you want to go around telling people they have, but you can joke with your friends about it.

112
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:05,919
Right, exactly.

113
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,659
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

114
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,299
What are you talking about?

115
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,059
I'm always a size four.

116
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,980
Here, I'll try these.

117
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,419
They seem a bit too tight.

118
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,580
Shall I find you a larger size?

119
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,740
No, they fit fine.

120
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,879
They show off my curves perfectly.

121
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,580
Yeah, your love handles.

122
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,340
They sure do.

123
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,000
Although, here, you forgot to close this button.

124
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,460
Yeah, right.

125
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:03,720
I'll do it now.

126
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:17,620
All right, so speaking about pants, I've noticed something that the girl asked for a size four, but she really was a size eight.

127
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,539
So how does this work?

128
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:23,139
Because as guys, we don't have size fours, five, or ones, or anything.

129
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,820
You buy a pair of jeans, you say size 32 in the waist and size 30 in length or something like this.

130
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,379
So that's right.

131
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,080
Men's clothes usually indicate the size of your waist.

132
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,460
So 32 is a 32-inch waist.

133
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:39,419
But women's clothes don't have those measurements.

134
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,379
And I sometimes think it would be better if we did because it's very hard.

135
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:49,220
Some stores have size four, which is one size, but if you go to another store, it's very different.

136
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,860
So you always have to try on these clothes.

137
00:10:52,299 --> 00:11:00,580
But normally, in America, the sizes go from zero, which is the very, very smallest, to 14 or 16, which is the largest.

138
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,779
A normal size for most women would be an eight, I think, an eight or a ten.

139
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:16,240
And now, obviously, this depends on the countries because, for example, being in Asia, in China, women are usually a little bit thinner or smaller.

140
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:25,179
So it's harder, I think, to actually have this universal form of measurements for girls.

141
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,019
That's right.

142
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,700
So in the back of your pants, for example, there'll usually be some fabric.

143
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,419
And it will say the size according to different countries.

144
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:37,059
So in America, size six.

145
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,159
In China, size, I don't know, 28.

146
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,940
And so they'll have the different numbers.

147
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,100
And UK is also a different size.

148
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,200
Kind of like your shoes.

149
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:56,480
If you look inside your shoe, it'll say, I think, a Japanese size, the UK size, which is like 41, 42, and the USA size, which is like size eight or nine.

150
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:56,919
Size eight, yeah.

151
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,059
So it's very, very interesting, especially when you're buying clothes.

152
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,879
You have to remember what size you are, and you have to ask the person that you try it on.

153
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,159
Because some things I know you can try on, right?

154
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,059
That's right.

155
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:13,480
And in some stores, you have to ask for help to take things off the racks.

156
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,960
So it can be very difficult.

157
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,419
But normally, if you say, hey, can I try this on, the shopkeeper will help you.

158
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:19,899
