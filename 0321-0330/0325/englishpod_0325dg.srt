EnglishPod.com Hey, Michelle.

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:11,859
Good to see you.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,720
Are you at lunch?

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,980
Oh, hi, Jim.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,580
No, I just got back.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,519
I thought you were on vacation now.

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,160
No, I wish I was.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,280
I just got back from Spain, actually.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,559
Oh, wonderful.

10
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,879
Have you been there before or was it your first time?

11
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,739
My first time.

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,839
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this is my first time to Spain.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,380
It was amazing and the weather was just beautiful.

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,600
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,979
I'm so jealous of you.

16
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,280
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,899
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,539
Well, I really recommend Spain.

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,960
You really should go.

20
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,759
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

21
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,780
This is my floor.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,179
Speak again soon, I hope.

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,020
For sure.

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,700
Take care.
