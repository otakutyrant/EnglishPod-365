EnglishPod.com Hey, Michelle.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good to see you.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are you at lunch?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, hi, Jim.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No, I just got back.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I thought you were on vacation now.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No, I wish I was.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I just got back from Spain, actually.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, wonderful.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Have you been there before or was it your first time?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
My first time.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this is my first time to Spain.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was amazing and the weather was just beautiful.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm so jealous of you.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I really recommend Spain.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You really should go.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is my floor.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Speak again soon, I hope.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For sure.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Take care.
