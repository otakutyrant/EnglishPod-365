00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,319
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,259
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:08,599
And today at EnglishPod, we have a lesson for you about small talk.

5
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,259
That's right.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:17,899
We continue with our series about short, casual conversations you may have with your friends, somebody you haven't seen in a long time, or maybe even a co-worker.

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:18,800
That's right.

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,980
So in today's dialogue, we're going to listen to two people who work in the same building.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,579
They're going to talk a little bit about travel, right, Marco?

10
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:27,039
Yep.

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,559
We're going to talk a little bit about recommending a place to go on vacation, maybe Europe.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,659
And so we're going to have some great phrases as to speaking of this topic very briefly with a friend.

13
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:38,299
All right.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,799
Let's listen to today's dialogue.

15
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,979
Oh, I wish I was.

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,140
I just got back from Spain, actually.

17
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,340
Oh, wonderful.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,680
Have you been there before, or was it your first time?

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,579
My first time.

20
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,659
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain.

21
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:09,719
It was amazing.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200
And the weather was just beautiful.

23
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,420
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

24
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,799
I'm so jealous of you.

25
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,140
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,719
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

27
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,379
Well, I really recommend Spain.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,780
You really should go.

29
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,599
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

30
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:29,620
This is my floor.

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,019
Speak again soon, I hope.

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,840
For sure.

33
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,620
Take care.

34
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,640
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:40,060
So now let's take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:43,099
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,480
All right, in Language Takeaway, we've got a couple of words and phrases for you.

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,719
The first one is I just got back.

39
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,760
So to get back from somewhere, Marco.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,939
That's right, Jim.

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,939
Jim just got back from Europe.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:04,060
And when you say I just got back is I recently or very recently returned from somewhere.

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:04,939
That's right.

44
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,920
To get back from somewhere means to return from that place.

45
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,280
So in this dialogue, Jim just got back from Spain.

46
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,580
Michelle just got back from lunch.

47
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,759
This means to return from somewhere.

48
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:17,240
That's right.

49
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,259
So it can be a place, not only a country, but it can be, for example, the office.

50
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,960
I just got back from work.

51
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:27,120
Or I just got back from football practice.

52
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,539
That's why I'm very sweaty.

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,139
Right.

54
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,620
So this obviously means that you are now not in the same place where you just got back from.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,979
No, I'm from America.

56
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
I went to Spain on vacation and I just got back from Spain.

57
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,020
That means I'm in America again.

58
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
You're not still in Spain.

60
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:44,580
No.

61
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:47,879
All right, so that's for our first word.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,879
Now let's go on.

63
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,780
And Michelle said, oh, I'm so jealous of you.

64
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,180
All right.

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,960
Jealous is an adjective and a very, very common one.

66
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,860
You can use it in many different circumstances.

67
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,719
It means to want what someone else has.

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,500
That's right.

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,740
So in this case, Michelle is jealous that Jim went on vacation.

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,879
So she wishes she could go on vacation.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,580
That's right.

72
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,900
I'm so jealous of you.

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,400
Or if you see someone who has a new pair of shoes and you like the shoes because you don't have them, you can say, I'm so jealous.

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,680
I love your shoes.

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,300
That's right.

76
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,360
So you say, I am jealous.

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,800
Or if you are jealous of a person, you say, I am jealous of you.

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,560
And so they were ending their conversation.

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,680
And Jim said, you know what?

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,699
It's been great to catch up with you.

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:32,280
All right.

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,639
This is a really important phrase to catch up.

83
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,479
It means two different things.

84
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:47,580
And we're going to talk about one meaning here today to catch up with someone like to talk to them about what they've been doing recently means to learn about their life because maybe you haven't talked in a long time.

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,419
That's right.

86
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:58,500
So maybe you haven't seen your friend in two years and you go out for dinner to catch up to talk about what has happened in your life recently.

87
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,180
That's right.

88
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:06,500
Or you can, if you see a friend on the street and you know that you haven't seen him or her in a long time, you can make a date to catch up.

89
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:09,099
So Hey Marco, I haven't seen you in months.

90
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,039
Let's catch up sometime soon.

91
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,599
That's right.

92
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,839
And that means to share information and to find out how you have been recently.

93
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,120
All right.

94
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:22,319
Now when he was getting out of the elevator, he said, this is my floor.

95
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,899
Now we know floor, but my floor, what is it?

96
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,339
My floor?

97
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:25,980
Your floor?

98
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,660
Whose floor?

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
This doesn't make much sense, does it?

100
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,939
Well, actually floor here means that this is the floor that I work on or the floor that I live on.

101
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,839
It means the place I'm going to.

102
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,240
Right.

103
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:46,199
So we know floor, the ground beneath our feet in a building, but in this case we're talking about one of the levels of a building.

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,699
So maybe the sixth floor.

105
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,360
That's right.

106
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,120
So if I'm in my apartment building in the elevator, I can say, Oh, stop the elevator.

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,139
This is my floor.

108
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,379
I want to get off the elevator.

109
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:57,720
Right.

110
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,199
This is where I live.

111
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,439
All right.

112
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,699
So a lot of great stuff there.

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,040
Why don't we take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

114
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey, Michelle.

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,980
Good to see you.

116
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,819
Are you at lunch?

117
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,079
Oh, hi, Jim.

118
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,680
No, I just got back.

119
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,620
I thought you were on vacation now.

120
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,259
No, I wish I was.

121
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,360
I just got back from Spain actually.

122
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,639
Oh, wonderful.

123
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,959
Have you been there before or was it your first time?

124
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,860
My first time.

125
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,959
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain.

126
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,000
It was amazing.

127
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,480
And the weather was just beautiful.

128
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,759
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

129
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,060
I'm so jealous of you.

130
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,379
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sites.

132
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:47,620
Well, I really recommend Spain.

133
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,079
You really should go.

134
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,860
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

135
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,879
This is my floor.

136
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,300
Speak again soon, I hope.

137
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:56,120
For sure.

138
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,839
Take care.

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,300
All right, we're back.

140
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,579
So now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,180
Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,279
So there are some keys to these small talk conversations and they are definitely the phrases.

143
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,399
The first one we have here is good to see you.

144
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,879
So Jim says, hey, Michelle, good to see you.

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,579
That's right.

146
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:27,339
So we've chosen this phrase because it's very casual and very common to use as a polite way of saying, hey, how are you?

147
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,160
Good to see you.

148
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm actually showing you that I'm happy that I am talking to you.

149
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,860
So this is a very flexible phrase.

150
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,980
You can say it at the beginning of a conversation when you just see someone.

151
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,579
Hey, Marco, good to see you.

152
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:42,740
Or at the end, you can say it was very good to see you.

153
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,620
I hope to see you again soon.

154
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,480
That's right.

155
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:52,939
So maybe you can use it at the beginning if you just begin to talk to someone or if you're saying goodbye, you can say, well, you know what?

156
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:55,980
I have to go now, but it's been good to see you.

157
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,600
So very flexible phrase.

158
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,339
That's right.

159
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:58,759
That's right.

160
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:03,939
Now, when Michelle thought that Jim was on vacation, Jim said, no, no, no.

161
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,699
I wish I was.

162
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,800
All right.

163
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,600
I wish I was.

164
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,879
I thought you were on vacation.

165
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,540
So she thought that he was still on vacation in Spain.

166
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,180
And he says, well, I'm not because, you know, here I am.

167
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,680
But I wish I was.

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,379
I wish I was in Spain right now because Spain is so nice.

169
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,079
That's right.

170
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,860
So it may seem a little bit strange, but it's actually completing the idea.

171
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,959
So and basically we're using the verb to be because that's the question.

172
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,060
Are you on vacation?

173
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,459
No, I wish I was on vacation.

174
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,639
So that means he's not, but he wants to be.

175
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,459
That's right.

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,459
OK, so now he actually had to get going and he used this exact phrase.

177
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,819
He said, I must be going.

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,399
I must be going.

179
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
Now, remember this as a phrase.

180
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,819
This is a good way to end a conversation.

181
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,439
Maybe you have to go to work.

182
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,420
Maybe you have your kids at home.

183
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,899
You have to take them somewhere.

184
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,540
So you say, I'm really sorry.

185
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,500
I must be going, but let's see each other again soon.

186
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:04,220
That's right.

187
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,560
So you are politely ending the conversation.

188
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,259
You are politely saying, I can't talk to you anymore.

189
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,300
I must be going now, but it's been great to talk to you.

190
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:13,620
That's right.

191
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,240
Very polite.

192
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,000
So remember this one.

193
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,000
It's better than I'm going now.

194
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:17,480
Right.

195
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,120
We don't say that.

196
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,339
Yeah.

197
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,100
Or I have to go.

198
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,540
Well, you can say I have to go, but it's nice saying, oh, you know what?

199
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,199
I really like talking to you, but I must be going.

200
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,560
And Jim also finished by saying, we'll speak again soon.

201
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,579
And Michelle said, for sure.

202
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,620
For sure.

203
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,899
Now, Americans particularly love to say this phrase.

204
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,059
For sure means yes, or I agree, or definitely.

205
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:40,759
Right.

206
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,820
You can use it as an interjection.

207
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,220
So if I say, hey, Catherine, am I going to see you later on today?

208
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
Yeah, for sure.

209
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:48,960
For sure.

210
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:49,500
There we go.

211
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,399
So you're saying yes, absolutely, definitely, for sure.

212
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,720
So, Marco, my birthday is Friday night.

213
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,720
Are you going to come to the party?

214
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,519
Ah, for sure.

215
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,940
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

216
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,500
Aww.

217
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,360
All right.

218
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,519
So that's all we have for today.

219
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,720
Why don't we review everything we've taken a look at now and listen to the dialogue one last time.

220
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,620
Hey, Michelle.

221
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,559
Good to see you.

222
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,419
Are you at lunch?

223
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,700
Oh, hi, Jim.

224
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,259
No, I just got back.

225
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,240
I thought you were on vacation now.

226
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,860
No, I wish I was.

227
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,019
I just got back from Spain, actually.

228
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,240
Oh, wonderful.

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,580
Have you been there before, or was it your first time?

230
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,480
My first time.

231
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,559
I've traveled around Europe a lot, but this was my first time to Spain.

232
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,100
It was amazing, and the weather was just beautiful.

233
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,299
No rain and just sun, sun, sun.

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,679
I'm so jealous of you.

235
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,019
I've never been anywhere in Europe.

236
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,600
I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights.

237
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,299
Well, I really recommend Spain.

238
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,700
You really should go.

239
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,480
Anyway, it's been great to catch up, but I must be going.

240
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,500
This is my floor.

241
00:09:58,019 --> 00:09:58,899
Speak again soon, I hope.

242
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,720
For sure.

243
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,480
Take care.

244
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,440
All right, so this was another part of our small talk series.

245
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:13,159
As you can see, very short, but very useful language used to talk very briefly with someone.

246
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,019
It always happens.

247
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:18,480
You meet somebody at the elevator, or you just want to talk very quickly.

248
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:28,399
Yeah, but you don't want to talk about anything that's too personal, like someone's politics or their religious beliefs or their children, because maybe you don't know them very well.

249
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,679
These are really great topics to talk about, like business trips or vacation or the weather.

250
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,019
English speakers love to talk about these when they don't know someone that well.

251
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,200
That's right, that's right.

00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:49,559

254
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:51,220
Bye.

255
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,779
See you guys, bye.
