00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
EnglishPod.com What did you cook?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Great idea, as long as I don't get food poisoning.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, what is on the menu tonight?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, for starters, we have tam yum soup.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a bit spicy, but really good.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is delicious.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, this next dish is one of the most famous.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is tom sam.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded, unripened papaya and tomato.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is delicious.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I could have this every day.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, now for the last and best dish, in my opinion.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is called pad thai.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's stir-fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu, garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wow, this is great.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Want some more?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm stuffed.
