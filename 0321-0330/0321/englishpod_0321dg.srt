00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:06,519
EnglishPod.com What did you cook?

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,019
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,820
So, I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,140
Great idea, as long as I don't get food poisoning.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,300
So, what is on the menu tonight?

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,219
Okay, for starters, we have tam yum soup.

7
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:24,839
It's a bit spicy, but really good.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,300
This is delicious.

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,420
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,899
Now, this next dish is one of the most famous.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,359
Foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is tom sam.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,899
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded, unripened papaya and tomato.

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,359
This is delicious.

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,619
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,359
I could have this every day.

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,039
Okay, now for the last and best dish, in my opinion.

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,200
This is called pad thai.

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:12,260
It's stir-fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu, garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,959
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,519
Wow, this is great.

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,280
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,260
Want some more?

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,359
I'm stuffed.
