00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Catherine and we've been traveling around the world eating different foods from different countries and today we're in Thailand.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thai food is one of the most popular types of food around the world, especially because of that specific Asian taste it has.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And so we're going to jump right into this dialogue today and see what we have prepared for you today.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What did you cook?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Great idea.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
As long as I don't get food poisoning.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So what is on the menu tonight?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, for starters we have Tom Yum soup.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a bit spicy but really good.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is delicious.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now this next dish is one of the most famous.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is Tom Sam.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded unripened papaya and tomato.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is delicious.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I could have this every day.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, now for the last and best dish in my opinion.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is called Pad Thai.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's stir fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Wow, this is great.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Want some more?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm stuffed.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright, so we've got a number of different dishes we'd like to talk about as well as phrases.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So let's look at some of those dishes and important keywords in language takeaway.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Language takeaway.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, so the first word we have on language takeaway today is food poisoning.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So we don't want to get food poisoning when having this any meal.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Any meal.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, that's right.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Food poisoning is a bad thing.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now this is something that happens when you eat bad food or dirty food.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Basically you get very, very sick and you feel like you have to vomit.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You have to throw up.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's right.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So your stomach hurts.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You feel like you have to throw up.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You may be going to the bathroom very often.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That means usually you have food poisoning.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alright, and so people often associate food poisoning with food that you eat on the street.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe dirtier food.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But this is something you should be very careful of when you're traveling.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Not to Thailand alone, but maybe to any other country.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can get it in America.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can get it in Mexico.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So just something to be careful of.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's right.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So apart from that, we're going to jump into our first dish for today.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We're having a soup called Tom Yum soup.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Tom Yum soup.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now this is one of my favorite soups.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's quite spicy, isn't it, Marco?

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Very spicy, but very, very good as well.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It has a kind of citric taste, like lemon.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It does, and it's very yellow or orange colored.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a very, very common dish on Thai restaurant menus.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And there are some key ingredients in this soup that I think are important to discuss.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're often found in Thai food and other kinds of Asian food.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The first one is ginger.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ginger, that's right.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is a root.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It kind of looks like a potato almost.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It does.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's usually white and it has little arms.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not a round object.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's got pointy little arms.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And the characteristic taste of ginger is kind of strong and bitter.

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It is quite strong.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You'll find it in Japanese food.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oftentimes you get pickled ginger to eat.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's like a pink food.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You get it with sushi.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Other times in Chinese cooking, it's something that's chopped up with garlic and cooked in oil.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So ginger is a very important one.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So in this soup, we have ginger and we also have lemongrass.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So this is very interesting because it's not very easily found around the world.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is very common in Southeast Asian cooking.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And you might have a hard time finding it in places like America where it's not really a part of the cuisine.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But lemongrass is very distinct.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It has a very strong flavor and it's actually quite long.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's green and long.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It looks a bit like celery, but it's harder.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And the taste that it gives it is a little bit citric, kind of like a lemon almost.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's right.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But you're going to find this in soups like tom yum or other things.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So lemongrass is another one.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And then moving on to our next dish, which is one of the most, I think, the most popular dishes of all Thailand is the famous pad thai.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Pad thai.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now, this is absolutely my favorite thai dish, and I know that's very cliche.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's something that everyone says, but it's true.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You know, this is a great dish you can buy on the street.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can buy it in a restaurant.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's basically a noodle dish, right?

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a stir fried noodles with eggs and peanuts are the most like the key ingredients in there.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But you might also get a little bit of hot red pepper, some sugar, some lime.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And the noodles are flat.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They're not round.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And actually, one of the key ingredients also that gives it this very distinct taste is tamarind juice.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All right.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Tamarind juice.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is, again, another one of those flavors from Southeast Asia that you might not find in many other places, certainly not America.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now, tamarind, they're funny looking things.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They look like peas, but they're dark brown.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's right.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So tamarind juice gives it this kind of sweet flavor.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So this is the interesting thing about pad thai is that you have the sweet flavors from the tamarind juice, from even the fish sauce, combined with chili.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So it's kind of like a spicy, very sweet taste.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then you have citrus.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have some lime, maybe, and some sugar.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So it's a lot of different tastes and flavors, but it's a really magical combination.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So that's all we have for language takeaway.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why don't we take another listen to our dialogue?

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What did you cook?

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Great idea.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
As long as I don't get food poisoning.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So what is on the menu tonight?

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For starters, we have tom yum soup.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a bit spicy, but really good.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is delicious.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now, this next dish is one of the most famous.

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is tom sam.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded, unripened papaya and tomato.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is delicious.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I could have this every day.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now for the last and best dish, in my opinion.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is called pad thai.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's stir fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wow.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is great.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Want some more?

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm stuffed.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, we're back.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fluency Builder.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So first up, we have the phrase on the menu.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's on the menu tonight?

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's right.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That person asked, so what's on the menu?

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And by saying this, we're saying, well, what are we having for dinner?

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What are we going to eat?

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So you might want to think, okay, menu.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm going to look at the menu.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But you could even say this at home where there is no menu.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is a spoken language way of saying, what are we eating tonight?

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Right.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What's for dinner?

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What's what what are we eating?

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What's on the menu?

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Even though, as you said, there's no menu.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's right.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And after that, we have another phrase that's really important.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We say for starters, we're going to have this or that.

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So for starters.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's right.

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We said for starters, we are having a soup, a tom yam soup.

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So a starter dish is something that you have to begin the meal, a small dish, maybe.

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right.

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Start starter.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So a starter is a noun.

188
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's a thing.

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it's something you eat at the beginning.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Usually it's not very heavy.

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not a steak would never be a starter.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right.

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
All right.

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So here we have Tom Yum soup, which is our starter.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And and after that, we have the national dish.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now, this is a great phrase.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Right.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We had the pad thai, which is considered to be the national dish.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so usually every country has their national dish, something that's unique or that a country is famous for.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Like, for example, China would be famous for Kung Pao chicken, Kung Pao chicken.

202
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In America, you might even say that apple pie is the most important national dish.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But do you guys have one in Ecuador with this?

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I would say I have no idea which would be.

205
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's very not not very well known.

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Maybe ceviche is kind of shared between Peru and Ecuador.

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Like maybe in Argentina, you would say steak steak is a national dish.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, absolutely.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Or in Mexico, you know, like tacos or enchiladas, stuff like that.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Or in Italy, spaghetti bolognese.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So we have we have a number of different countries and each country maybe has one or two national dishes.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
These are very special dishes that that are important for that country.

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's right.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So we have our national dishes.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And after we finish dinner, we ate so much that we say I'm stuffed.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm stuffed.

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Now, this is a common phrase that you will hear at the end of a meal when you've eaten and eaten and eaten.

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And it just means I'm full.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm full.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not eat anymore.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah, I'm stuffed.

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So stuffed means that I'm full of things.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Now, it's it's a very informal way of saying I'm full.

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Because if somebody says, would you like some more soup?

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You say, no, thank you.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm full.

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Right.

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But if you're with friends, you can say, oh, I just had so much pizza.

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm stuffed.

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right.

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So it's a little bit more informal, but a lot more native like.

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So let's take a listen to our dialogue one last time.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What did you cook?

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, as you know, I was in Thailand last month and I took a cooking class, so I prepared some of my favorite dishes.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Great idea.

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
As long as I don't get food poisoning.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So what is on the menu tonight?

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
OK, for starters, we have Tom Yum soup.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a bit spicy, but really good.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This is delicious.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The ginger and lemongrass really give it a nice taste.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now, this next dish is one of the most famous foreigners call it papaya salad, but the proper name is Tom Sam.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables, including shredded, unripened papaya and tomato.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is delicious.

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting.

251
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I could have this every day.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OK, now for the last and best dish, in my opinion.

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is called Pad Thai.

254
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's stir fried noodles with eggs, fish sauce, tamarind juice, red chili pepper, plus bean sprouts, shrimp and tofu.

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's practically Thailand's national dish.

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Wow, this is great.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious.

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Want some more?

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm stuffed.

261
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
All right.

262
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So speaking of Thai food, it's very famous around the world, but it's very spicy.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It can be very spicy.

264
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And what always surprises me about Thai food is that the salads might be the spiciest things on the menu.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
People like to eat many different salads.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You have like a Chiang Mai chicken salad or you have a papaya salad.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But these are really, really spicy.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, that's right.

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We saw in our dialogue that we're eating papaya salad.

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And it's very interesting because it has this fruit, like a papaya, and it has some other vegetables as well.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But the salad is very, very spicy itself.

272
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's right.

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And you would never think of a fruit salad as being something that's spicy in America.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You'd think of it as being pretty tame, pretty boring.

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But that's the kind of what gives it a certain attraction to it, right?

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Absolutely.

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And I don't know if you're a big fan of Thai food.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I certainly am.

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And I really like that about Thai food that you can have these really spicy dishes, but there's just so much flavor.

280
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
There's so many things happening.

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Lemongrass, sugar, lime, fish sauce.

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yeah, it's very, very good.

283
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And speaking of national dishes, this is actually a very interesting question because, as we mentioned, a couple of countries have national dishes like Italy and different places.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But what about in your country?

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Do you have a national dish or what would you consider to be your national dish?

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So we'd love to hear from you guys.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What's your national dish?

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Tell us all about it, what it tastes like.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And even if there's some history, tell us about that too.

291
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Bye.
