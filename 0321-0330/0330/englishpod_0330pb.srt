00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,779
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:04,580
Hi, guys.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,720
My name is Catherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson for you about some very interesting things.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,300
That's right.

6
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:17,079
Today we're going to talk about fortune tellers or people that read your future.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:17,739
All right.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:26,600
So if I want to know who I will marry, if I will be rich, I will go to this fortune teller and she or he will tell me what's in my future.

9
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,420
That's right.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,879
It's very popular in many cultures around the world.

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,619
Many different ways of reading your future or telling you your future.

12
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:37,719
So let's jump into this dialogue and see what's going on today.

13
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:48,679
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,520
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments for the next 12 months.

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,119
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

16
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,219
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read, and most of the things the psychic told them came true.

17
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:09,000
Of course it does.

18
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,680
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,400
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

20
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,879
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,939
Reading the tarot cards.

22
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,280
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.

23
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:29,239
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,439
All superstitious nonsense.

25
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,439
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

26
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:36,079
Great.

27
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,180
I'll make an appointment.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,060
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,379
So a lot of interesting things here.

30
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,340
Let's take a look at some of those words on Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,140
Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:02:00,299
So in Language Takeaway today, we are focusing on some words that describe fortune-telling, but also the different ways of doing so.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,519
The first word we have is actually a name for a person who can read the future.

34
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,019
Right, Marco?

35
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:05,579
That's right.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,159
A medium.

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,439
In the dialogue, we hear about a woman who is a medium and is very talented.

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,000
Actually a medium is interesting because a medium is a person who can communicate with the dead.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,560
That's right.

40
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,460
Or who can communicate with the other side.

41
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:27,099
And if you think about middle, medium, I mean the same thing, it's someone who is in the middle of two things.

42
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,599
And so a medium can maybe transmit these different ideas or signals.

43
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:33,919
Right, right, exactly.

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:42,500
So it's a person that basically communicates, as you say, with the dead, or someone that can listen to people who are not here anymore.

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:52,300
But obviously they are a type of person that could also use this gift to tell your future or to have the people who are dead tell you what's going to happen in the future.

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,860
That's right.

47
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,919
And so another kind of person who would do something similar is a psychic.

48
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:57,939
That's right.

49
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,400
Alright, now a psychic is a person who generally will read your future for you, will tell you the future.

50
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,879
Maybe the psychic will have a special tool, like a crystal ball.

51
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,960
Just remember that in English, psych, like psychology, psychosis, has to do with your mind.

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,400
That's right.

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,139
Alright, so a psychic uses their mind to find out things about you or your future.

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,460
That's right, so sometimes psychics will claim that they can read your mind as well, right?

55
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,620
It's a little scary.

56
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:40,360
So as you say, these are different, these are people who supposedly can tell you your future, and as you say, they use different methods or different tools.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,900
One of them is, for example, having your palms read.

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,979
Alright, so the psychic will go to you, Marco, and will look at your hand, and will read your palm.

59
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,419
Now, where on your hand is your palm?

60
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:57,120
It's on the other side, the side where you grab things with.

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,620
The inside, so the soft part.

62
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:59,020
Yes.

63
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,419
And maybe on your palm, you have many different lines.

64
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,340
So the psychic will look at the lines and will say, oh well, this line is very long, so you will have a long, long life.

65
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,080
That's right.

66
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:21,279
So supposedly, in your hands, you have lines that determine how much money you will have, or how many kids you will have, or how long you will live, so that's called a palm reading.

67
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,740
Or I am going to have my palm read.

68
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:25,620
That's right.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:37,220
Now, the other person doesn't really believe in all that stuff, and says that they are just scam artists, so he's saying that the psychics or the mediums are just scam artists.

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,920
All right, so what is a scam artist?

71
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,459
Well, a scam artist is not a real artist.

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,360
Right, right.

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,439
A scam artist is a thief, someone who will maybe tell you a story, or who will lie to you to try and take your money.

74
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,120
That's right.

75
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,439
So he's not really like a robber, like somebody that will break into your house and take your things.

76
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:06,560
No, he won't use a gun, maybe, hopefully not, but he will tell you a story, or will lie to you in a way that makes you want to give him money.

77
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,959
That's right, that's right.

78
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:32,759
So I don't know if any of you have ever received an email from someone who said, I am a wealthy person from a different part of the world, and I want you to give me money to help me so I can come to America, and these kinds of things where you don't know the person, he's probably lying to you, it's a very sad story, and they say, please give me money so I can come to visit you, or so I can come and have a good life.

79
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,360
That's a scam artist, because they probably don't have a bad life, they just want you to give them money.

80
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,060
That's right.

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,540
That's right, so that is a scam artist.

82
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:52,100
And what he went on to say about how all of these things, about fortune telling, about psychics and everything, is just superstitious nonsense.

83
00:05:52,819 --> 00:06:01,740
So then the girl went on to explain in saying that it's not really true that many cultures do things like, for example, read the tarot cards.

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:15,339
All right, so we had palm reading first, maybe talking to dead people with a medium, but this is another tool that psychics use to communicate with maybe the dead or to understand the future.

85
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,980
So we have tarot cards, and they're actually cards, you know, like playing cards, but they're a little bit different, right?

86
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,379
They don't have diamonds and hearts, they have different pictures.

87
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:46,980
Right, they have pictures of, for example, a king or a queen or a picture of a river or different symbols that basically the person who is getting their fortune read will take it and move them and shuffle them, and then will start flipping the cards over and then you will see supposedly what your future will be like.

88
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:56,500
All right, so those are tarot cards, but we have one more word here, and it actually comes from the friend who doesn't believe in these scam artists.

89
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,699
It calls it all superstitious nonsense.

90
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:00,439
That's right.

91
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,899
So a person that is superstitious believes in superstitions, and those are beliefs of good or bad luck.

92
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:09,779
Yeah, that's right.

93
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:16,079
So if I believe that the number 13 is very, very bad, I will avoid the number 13.

94
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,279
I won't sit down and chair number 13.

95
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,399
I won't buy a house on floor number 13 because I'm superstitious.

96
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,720
I believe that that number is bad luck.

97
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,399
That's right.

98
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:31,899
So many people believe that it's bad luck to break a mirror or to walk under a ladder.

99
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:37,100
Yes, also many Americans believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside.

100
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

101
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,720
So it's interesting because many cultures around the world have different types of superstitions, but we'll talk about that in a little bit.

102
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,180
Why don't we move on now to some fluency builder and take a look at some phrases.

103
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,300
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

104
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:06,100
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments for the next 12 months.

105
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,740
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

106
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,800
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read, and most of the things the psychic told them came true.

107
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,620
Of course it does.

108
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:24,319
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

109
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,040
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

110
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.

111
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:32,539
Reading the tarot cards.

112
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,840
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.

113
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,799
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

114
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,120
All superstitious nonsense.

115
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,019
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

116
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:46,720
Great.

117
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,779
I'll make an appointment.

118
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,059
All right, an important phrase that you don't have to be a psychic to use is booked solid.

119
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,960
Now we heard this at the beginning of the dialogue.

120
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:09,259
Right, because this person is so famous that so many people want to go there and get their fortunes read that this person is already booked solid for the next 12 months.

121
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,759
Okay, now booked solid is a very nice colloquial way to describe having no time for anything in English.

122
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:23,320
So basically, if a restaurant, for example, is booked solid, it means there are no tables available.

123
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:23,879
That's right.

124
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,059
Nothing is available there.

125
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,000
Everything is already reserved.

126
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,039
Yeah, it happens also with hotels.

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,899
Some hotels during, I don't know, let's say the Olympics, many of them are booked solid for the entire month.

128
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,980
Or you could even say this with your friends.

129
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,759
You say, hey, Marco, do you want to hang out Thursday, say, seven o'clock?

130
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,759
Sorry, I'm booked solid the entire day.

131
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:44,940
Popular guy.

132
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,700
That's right.

133
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,580
So you can say that a person is booked solid or that a business is booked solid.

134
00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:02,100
Now this next phrase is kind of more, it's not really real words, but we say they are hocus pocus mumbo jumbo.

135
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:06,980
Alright, hocus pocus is a way to describe superstitious things.

136
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,259
Like magic, right?

137
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:16,379
Because I think it comes from, supposedly it's a spell that witches or wizards will say, you know, like, hocus pocus and things like that.

138
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,120
Abracadabra.

139
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:17,840
Hocus.

140
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:18,399
Yeah.

141
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:19,879
Yeah.

142
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,980
But basically, this is something that we say when we're joking now in English.

143
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:27,340
So I'll say, oh, gosh, Marco, I just broke this mirror.

144
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,919
Seven years bad luck.

145
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,460
Do you really believe in all that hocus pocus?

146
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,200
Yes, I'm very superstitious.

147
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,659
So hocus pocus here means superstitious magic, superstitious stuff.

148
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,179
It's all hocus pocus.

149
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,559
What about mumbo jumbo?

150
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,759
Mumbo jumbo is also something we say when we're talking about magic or things that are superstitious.

151
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,299
So I can say, I don't believe in any of that superstitious mumbo jumbo means basically I don't I don't trust it.

152
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,899
I don't think it's true.

153
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:56,779
I think it's silly.

154
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:57,379
Right.

155
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:05,039
So mumbo jumbo you refer to that, that nonsense that irrational or unbelievable stuff.

156
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:05,639
That's right.

157
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:06,399
It's irrational.

158
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:07,259
Very good.

159
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:15,940
So hocus pocus referring to magic, mumbo jumbo referring to superstition or things that are not really believable, let's say.

160
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:25,120
And to end the dialogue, the guy says, well, you know what, OK, let's go to this psychic and see what she has to say just for kicks.

161
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,440
Just for kicks.

162
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,639
Now, I love this phrase.

163
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,659
I use it a lot.

164
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,899
It's very, very colloquial, very spoken English, so you guys should try to use it.

165
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,399
It means just for fun, just for fun.

166
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,620
So I'm not going because I believe, right, because I just said I think it's hocus pocus mumbo jumbo.

167
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:40,899
Right.

168
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,659
But I do think it will be fun.

169
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,480
So let's go just for kicks.

170
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,600
Just for kicks.

171
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:45,840
Yeah.

172
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,919
So it means that you're doing something not seriously.

173
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,240
You're just doing it for fun.

174
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:51,200
That's right.

175
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,700
So you can do anything just for kicks, really.

176
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,919
Maybe maybe like if you just sit down and start doing some math problems just for kicks.

177
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,620
Yeah.

178
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,799
You would do that.

179
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,419
Wouldn't you, Marco?

180
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,120
Just for kicks.

181
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,379
Yeah.

182
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,200
Or I'm going to take a singing class just for kicks, even though I don't take singing very seriously.

183
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:08,500
Right.

184
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,759
It's not like you want to become a professional singer.

185
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,240
You just want to do it for fun.

186
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,779
That's right.

187
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,500
All right.

188
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,179
Great stuff.

189
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,360
Why don't we review everything one last time?

190
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,340
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

191
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:34,159
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments for the next 12 months.

192
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,779
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,840
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told them came true.

194
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,659
Of course it does.

195
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,320
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

196
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,039
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

197
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:58,539
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.

198
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,580
Reading the tarot cards.

199
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:00,700
Yes.

200
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:02,879
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.

201
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,860
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

202
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,080
All superstitious nonsense.

203
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,100
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

204
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:14,720
Great.

205
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:15,820
I'll make an appointment.

206
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:20,340
All right.

207
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:25,799
So speaking about superstitions, as you said, some superstitions are more local.

208
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,679
Like for example, I think it's Americans that believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside a house.

209
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,460
I know that, for example, in China, it's the number four is considered bad luck.

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,120
That's right.

211
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,980
So you'll see that many buildings don't have a floor number four or 14.

212
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,340
That's right.

213
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,899
And actually it's similar in Western cultures because some hotels will not have a floor 13.

214
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,620
That's right.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,620
Are there any superstitions that are from Ecuador?

216
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,080
I think Hispanic.

217
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,519
There is one that's very particular with women, with Hispanic women.

218
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,019
They will not put their bags, their purses, on the floor.

219
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:02,639
Yes.

220
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,500
I've heard this before.

221
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:03,940
What is it?

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,559
Your money will fly away.

223
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,919
Your money will fall out or your money will go away.

224
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,759
So women will not put their bags or their purses on the floor.

225
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,700
That's why they will always put it on a chair or on the table, never, never on the floor.

226
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:19,120
They're very superstitious about this.

227
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,580
Very interesting.

228
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,700
Well, have you ever had your fortune told by a psychic?

229
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:24,039
No, no, I've never.

230
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,700
I've seen gypsies.

231
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,200
So gypsies are people that don't really live somewhere.

232
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,720
They don't settle anywhere.

233
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,720
They move around.

234
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,259
They go from city to city.

235
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:38,100
And I've seen them and they've approached me asking me if I want my fortune read.

236
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,679
But I don't really believe in that.

237
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,700
So it just seems like they wanted me to give them five dollars and they would just tell me anything.

238
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,059
You think it was mumbo jumbo?

239
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,159
I think it was mumbo jumbo.

240
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,200
Have you had your fortune read?

241
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,100
I've had tarot cards read for me.

242
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,620
To be honest, I don't really remember what my fortune was.

243
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:06,539
I don't remember if it was right or not right, but I do remember feeling very uncomfortable because the things that my and I don't believe in these things because I'm not superstitious.

244
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,299
But the things that the fortune teller told me I thought were interesting because they were very similar to things that I knew about myself.

245
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,820
So I don't know.

246
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:25,320
Yeah, some people it's interesting because some people will go to a fortune teller just for kicks and will actually agree or find it amazing what the fortune teller told them.

247
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,639
And other people aren't really just not really interested.

248
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,379
But it's very, very it's very closely related to different cultures.

249
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Some people have witch doctors that also will, you know, cleanse you or tell you your future and stuff like that.

250
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:39,539
That's right.

251
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,299
So we're actually very curious to hear about your culture.

252
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,580
Do you have superstitions in your culture and are there traditional forms of fortune telling?

253
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,440
Let us know.

254
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,039

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,019

Bye.
