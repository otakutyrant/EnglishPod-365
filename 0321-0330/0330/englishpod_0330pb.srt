00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, guys.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson for you about some very interesting things.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we're going to talk about fortune tellers or people that read your future.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All right.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So if I want to know who I will marry, if I will be rich, I will go to this fortune teller and she or he will tell me what's in my future.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's very popular in many cultures around the world.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Many different ways of reading your future or telling you your future.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's jump into this dialogue and see what's going on today.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments for the next 12 months.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read, and most of the things the psychic told them came true.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Of course it does.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Reading the tarot cards.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
All superstitious nonsense.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Great.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll make an appointment.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So a lot of interesting things here.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's take a look at some of those words on Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So in Language Takeaway today, we are focusing on some words that describe fortune-telling, but also the different ways of doing so.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The first word we have is actually a name for a person who can read the future.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Right, Marco?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's right.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A medium.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In the dialogue, we hear about a woman who is a medium and is very talented.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Actually a medium is interesting because a medium is a person who can communicate with the dead.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's right.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Or who can communicate with the other side.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And if you think about middle, medium, I mean the same thing, it's someone who is in the middle of two things.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And so a medium can maybe transmit these different ideas or signals.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right, right, exactly.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So it's a person that basically communicates, as you say, with the dead, or someone that can listen to people who are not here anymore.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But obviously they are a type of person that could also use this gift to tell your future or to have the people who are dead tell you what's going to happen in the future.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And so another kind of person who would do something similar is a psychic.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alright, now a psychic is a person who generally will read your future for you, will tell you the future.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Maybe the psychic will have a special tool, like a crystal ball.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Just remember that in English, psych, like psychology, psychosis, has to do with your mind.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright, so a psychic uses their mind to find out things about you or your future.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right, so sometimes psychics will claim that they can read your mind as well, right?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's a little scary.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So as you say, these are different, these are people who supposedly can tell you your future, and as you say, they use different methods or different tools.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
One of them is, for example, having your palms read.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alright, so the psychic will go to you, Marco, and will look at your hand, and will read your palm.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, where on your hand is your palm?

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's on the other side, the side where you grab things with.

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The inside, so the soft part.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And maybe on your palm, you have many different lines.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So the psychic will look at the lines and will say, oh well, this line is very long, so you will have a long, long life.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So supposedly, in your hands, you have lines that determine how much money you will have, or how many kids you will have, or how long you will live, so that's called a palm reading.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Or I am going to have my palm read.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, the other person doesn't really believe in all that stuff, and says that they are just scam artists, so he's saying that the psychics or the mediums are just scam artists.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right, so what is a scam artist?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, a scam artist is not a real artist.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right, right.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A scam artist is a thief, someone who will maybe tell you a story, or who will lie to you to try and take your money.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So he's not really like a robber, like somebody that will break into your house and take your things.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, he won't use a gun, maybe, hopefully not, but he will tell you a story, or will lie to you in a way that makes you want to give him money.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right, that's right.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So I don't know if any of you have ever received an email from someone who said, I am a wealthy person from a different part of the world, and I want you to give me money to help me so I can come to America, and these kinds of things where you don't know the person, he's probably lying to you, it's a very sad story, and they say, please give me money so I can come to visit you, or so I can come and have a good life.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's a scam artist, because they probably don't have a bad life, they just want you to give them money.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right, so that is a scam artist.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And what he went on to say about how all of these things, about fortune telling, about psychics and everything, is just superstitious nonsense.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So then the girl went on to explain in saying that it's not really true that many cultures do things like, for example, read the tarot cards.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All right, so we had palm reading first, maybe talking to dead people with a medium, but this is another tool that psychics use to communicate with maybe the dead or to understand the future.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So we have tarot cards, and they're actually cards, you know, like playing cards, but they're a little bit different, right?

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They don't have diamonds and hearts, they have different pictures.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right, they have pictures of, for example, a king or a queen or a picture of a river or different symbols that basically the person who is getting their fortune read will take it and move them and shuffle them, and then will start flipping the cards over and then you will see supposedly what your future will be like.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
All right, so those are tarot cards, but we have one more word here, and it actually comes from the friend who doesn't believe in these scam artists.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It calls it all superstitious nonsense.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's right.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So a person that is superstitious believes in superstitions, and those are beliefs of good or bad luck.

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, that's right.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So if I believe that the number 13 is very, very bad, I will avoid the number 13.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I won't sit down and chair number 13.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I won't buy a house on floor number 13 because I'm superstitious.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I believe that that number is bad luck.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So many people believe that it's bad luck to break a mirror or to walk under a ladder.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, also many Americans believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So it's interesting because many cultures around the world have different types of superstitions, but we'll talk about that in a little bit.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why don't we move on now to some fluency builder and take a look at some phrases.

103
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments for the next 12 months.

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read, and most of the things the psychic told them came true.

107
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Of course it does.

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

109
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Reading the tarot cards.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
All superstitious nonsense.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Great.

117
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll make an appointment.

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All right, an important phrase that you don't have to be a psychic to use is booked solid.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Now we heard this at the beginning of the dialogue.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right, because this person is so famous that so many people want to go there and get their fortunes read that this person is already booked solid for the next 12 months.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay, now booked solid is a very nice colloquial way to describe having no time for anything in English.

122
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So basically, if a restaurant, for example, is booked solid, it means there are no tables available.

123
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Nothing is available there.

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Everything is already reserved.

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, it happens also with hotels.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Some hotels during, I don't know, let's say the Olympics, many of them are booked solid for the entire month.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Or you could even say this with your friends.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You say, hey, Marco, do you want to hang out Thursday, say, seven o'clock?

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Sorry, I'm booked solid the entire day.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Popular guy.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's right.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you can say that a person is booked solid or that a business is booked solid.

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Now this next phrase is kind of more, it's not really real words, but we say they are hocus pocus mumbo jumbo.

135
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Alright, hocus pocus is a way to describe superstitious things.

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Like magic, right?

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because I think it comes from, supposedly it's a spell that witches or wizards will say, you know, like, hocus pocus and things like that.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Abracadabra.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hocus.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah.

141
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But basically, this is something that we say when we're joking now in English.

143
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So I'll say, oh, gosh, Marco, I just broke this mirror.

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Seven years bad luck.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you really believe in all that hocus pocus?

146
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, I'm very superstitious.

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So hocus pocus here means superstitious magic, superstitious stuff.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's all hocus pocus.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What about mumbo jumbo?

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Mumbo jumbo is also something we say when we're talking about magic or things that are superstitious.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So I can say, I don't believe in any of that superstitious mumbo jumbo means basically I don't I don't trust it.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't think it's true.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I think it's silly.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Right.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So mumbo jumbo you refer to that, that nonsense that irrational or unbelievable stuff.

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's irrational.

158
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Very good.

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So hocus pocus referring to magic, mumbo jumbo referring to superstition or things that are not really believable, let's say.

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And to end the dialogue, the guy says, well, you know what, OK, let's go to this psychic and see what she has to say just for kicks.

161
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Just for kicks.

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Now, I love this phrase.

163
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I use it a lot.

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's very, very colloquial, very spoken English, so you guys should try to use it.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It means just for fun, just for fun.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So I'm not going because I believe, right, because I just said I think it's hocus pocus mumbo jumbo.

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Right.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But I do think it will be fun.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So let's go just for kicks.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Just for kicks.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So it means that you're doing something not seriously.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're just doing it for fun.

174
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's right.

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So you can do anything just for kicks, really.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Maybe maybe like if you just sit down and start doing some math problems just for kicks.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

178
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You would do that.

179
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wouldn't you, Marco?

180
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Just for kicks.

181
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or I'm going to take a singing class just for kicks, even though I don't take singing very seriously.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right.

184
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's not like you want to become a professional singer.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You just want to do it for fun.

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's right.

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All right.

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Great stuff.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why don't we review everything one last time?

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium.

191
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It says that she is really gifted and so popular now that she's booked solid with appointments for the next 12 months.

192
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo, do you?

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told them came true.

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Of course it does.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They tell you general and obvious things like that you'll be successful or have a big house.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think most of the times they're just scam artists.

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, historically, it's a practice that many cultures share.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Reading the tarot cards.

199
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In the East, they would even read tea leaves.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar and then read your ashes.

202
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All superstitious nonsense.

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say just for kicks.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Great.

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll make an appointment.

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
All right.

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So speaking about superstitions, as you said, some superstitions are more local.

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Like for example, I think it's Americans that believe it's bad luck to open an umbrella inside a house.

209
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I know that, for example, in China, it's the number four is considered bad luck.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's right.

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So you'll see that many buildings don't have a floor number four or 14.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And actually it's similar in Western cultures because some hotels will not have a floor 13.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's right.

215
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Are there any superstitions that are from Ecuador?

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think Hispanic.

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There is one that's very particular with women, with Hispanic women.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They will not put their bags, their purses, on the floor.

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've heard this before.

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What is it?

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Your money will fly away.

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Your money will fall out or your money will go away.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So women will not put their bags or their purses on the floor.

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's why they will always put it on a chair or on the table, never, never on the floor.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They're very superstitious about this.

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Very interesting.

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, have you ever had your fortune told by a psychic?

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No, no, I've never.

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've seen gypsies.

231
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So gypsies are people that don't really live somewhere.

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
They don't settle anywhere.

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They move around.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They go from city to city.

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And I've seen them and they've approached me asking me if I want my fortune read.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But I don't really believe in that.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it just seems like they wanted me to give them five dollars and they would just tell me anything.

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You think it was mumbo jumbo?

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I think it was mumbo jumbo.

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Have you had your fortune read?

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've had tarot cards read for me.

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
To be honest, I don't really remember what my fortune was.

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't remember if it was right or not right, but I do remember feeling very uncomfortable because the things that my and I don't believe in these things because I'm not superstitious.

244
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But the things that the fortune teller told me I thought were interesting because they were very similar to things that I knew about myself.

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So I don't know.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, some people it's interesting because some people will go to a fortune teller just for kicks and will actually agree or find it amazing what the fortune teller told them.

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And other people aren't really just not really interested.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But it's very, very it's very closely related to different cultures.

249
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Some people have witch doctors that also will, you know, cleanse you or tell you your future and stuff like that.

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's right.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So we're actually very curious to hear about your culture.

252
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Do you have superstitions in your culture and are there traditional forms of fortune telling?

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let us know.

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000

Bye.
