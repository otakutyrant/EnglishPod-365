1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Kathryn, and you've probably heard us talking a little bit about Smalltalk the past few weeks.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have another episode about Smalltalk, and we're going to teach you some things that you can say to people when you haven't seen them or maybe even met them before.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we're going to talk to a stranger, so we're going to talk very briefly about some casual topic.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And so let's jump into the dialogue and see what happens.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Excuse me.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Is this seat taken?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, please feel free.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thanks a lot.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you work in Shanghai?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, I do.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How about you?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, I'm a tourist.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This place is amazing.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's much bigger than I imagined and much more exciting.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There's so much to see here.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You can say that again.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's much more modern than people imagine.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Where are you from?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, let's see.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm from Kansas originally, a much quieter and more peaceful place than here, that's for sure.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But I'm living in Paris right now.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, Paris.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wonderful.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'd love to visit sometime.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right, we're back.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So now we're going to take a look at a lot of phrases on this occasion.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So let's go for Fluency Builder Part 1.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Fluency Builder All right, so the first phrase we have is a very common phrase if you're in a train or on a bus.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You hear the phrase, is this seat taken?

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Right, so Michelle came up to the stranger and said, excuse me, is this seat taken?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That means, is anybody sitting here?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It basically means, can I sit here?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Right.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But this is a very polite way of asking if you can sit down in the seat.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can also say it in a restaurant, at a movie theater, in a classroom.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So remember this one.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This was a really, really common phrase.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So it's a very polite way of saying, can I sit down?

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're asking for permission, basically.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Is the seat taken?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because what if a person says, well, no, it's not?

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you have to say, may I sit down?

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
May I take a seat?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, if they say, I'm sorry, someone is sitting here, that means that maybe they're waiting for a friend.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And then, no, you can't sit there.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But if they say, sure, like in the dialogue, feel free, then you're really basically able to sit down, no problem.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right, so the stranger answers by saying, no, please feel free.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So he says, no, the seat is not taken, please feel free.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What does he mean by this?

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, feel free is a very unusual phrase in English, but one that you're going to hear a lot.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It basically means, do what you want to do.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, so if I want to sit down, I say, is this seat taken?

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you say, feel free, Marco, that means, feel free to sit down.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, so we can complete the sentence by saying, no, please feel free to sit down, but it's kind of stating the obvious.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're saying, basically, feel free to do what you want.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right, but you could use it in other ways.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
For example, hey, Marco, are you using this pen right here?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No, no, feel free.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That means, feel free to use my pen.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, very good.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So then they started talking about what they do, where they work, and Michelle said, yes, I work in Shanghai.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How about you?

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, how about you?

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, this is a really important construction.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is a really important phrase in English, and I think a lot of people make mistakes with this.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So how about you means, do you work in Shanghai?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I just said, I work in Shanghai, but how about you?

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you?

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Right, exactly.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So that's saying, and you?

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you work here?

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or, and you?

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do you do?

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How about you?

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now, the common mistake with how about you, or using the construction how about, is that, for some reason, some people seem to think that it means, how is it?

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So, for example, if someone says, how about your weekend?

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's wrong.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, we don't say that.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How was your weekend?

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But in this case, how about you always follows a statement.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, so yes, I do live in Shanghai, how about you?

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That means, do you live in Shanghai?

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If I say, I would like to eat a hamburger and french fries, how about you?

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How about you?

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What would you like to eat?

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Exactly.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So remember, that's the way that you use how about.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Never say, how about your weekend, or how about your vacation, when you want to ask, how was it?

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't say that.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No, basically this is a way to reply to someone when they're telling you about their experience, you want to talk about yours.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, so let's take a break, let's review everything, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder part 2.

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

99
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, please, feel free.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thanks a lot.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you work in Shanghai?

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes, I do.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How about you?

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, I'm a tourist.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This place is amazing, it's much bigger than I imagined, and much more exciting.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's so much to see here.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can say that again.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's much more modern than people imagine.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where are you from?

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, let's see, I'm from Kansas originally, a much quieter and more peaceful place than here, that's for sure.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Uh-huh.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I'm living in Paris right now.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, Paris, wonderful, I'd love to visit sometime.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's continue with some more phrases on Fluency Builder.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, this first phrase is one that I really like to use.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The phrase is from Michelle, she says, you can say that again, but she's talking about how Shanghai is so big and so exciting.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And Michelle says, you can say that again.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, what does this mean, Marco?

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's right, so she is basically agreeing with the person.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The stranger says Shanghai is amazing, it's great, there's so much to see.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Michelle says, you can say that again.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's saying, I agree with you, you are so right.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I really agree.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Alright, so this is very emphatic, that means that it's really, it's more than just I agree, it's I really, really agree.

125
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The person really feels something about this, feels passionately about it.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's right, so if you go to the movies and you say, oh, that movie was terrible, you can say...

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You can say that again.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Exactly.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That means, oh, I agree, it was really bad.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now, when Michelle asked the stranger where he was from, he says, I'm from Kansas originally.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, what's originally?

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm original?

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm from Kansas originally means maybe I don't live in Kansas now, but that's where I come from.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Origin originally, that means, you know, at the beginning.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Right.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So just remember, Kansas, by the way, is one of the states in the United States, and so he's saying he's from Kansas, but now he lives in Paris.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So that's why you say, I'm originally from Kansas, but I live in Paris.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Alright, so Marco, you live here in Shanghai, but where do you come from originally?

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Originally, I'm from Ecuador.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Alright, and I'm originally from Chicago, but I currently live in China.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's right.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, so as he was talking about Kansas, he also said that, well, it's obviously a lot quieter and more peaceful, and then he ends his statement by saying, that's for sure.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's for sure.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And this is a phrase that we use to add emphasis on something.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's almost like saying, this is a really quiet, much quieter and peaceful place.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's for sure.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It really is.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's not like you're adding anything to the statement, like no meaning, but you're actually kind of making it more strong.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right, you're saying it's a fact.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's a fact.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's really this way.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So obviously, Kansas compared to Shanghai is a lot more quieter, that's for sure.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Or I could say that in Chicago in the winter, it's a lot colder than Shanghai, that's for sure.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So again, you're emphasizing on your statement, telling everyone that it's very, very much like this.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is how it really is.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, so that's all the phrases we have for you.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time.

161
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, please feel free.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thanks a lot.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Do you work in Shanghai?

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes, I do.

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How about you?

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, I'm a tourist.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This place is amazing.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's much bigger than I imagined and much more exciting.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There's so much to see here.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can say that again.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's much more modern than people imagine.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Where are you from?

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, let's see.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm from Kansas originally, a much quieter and more peaceful place than here, that's for sure.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Uh-huh.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I'm living in Paris right now.

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, Paris.

179
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Wonderful.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'd love to visit sometime.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right, so small talk with a stranger.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is actually a very common scenario.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If in a bus, in a train, you sit next to a stranger, this is more or less what you're going to talk about.

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Where are you from?

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What do you do?

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Where do you live?

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's right.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And you don't even have to talk about this with a total stranger.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You could actually use this with someone that you're working with or just an acquaintance.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So basically these are key questions that you would ask someone that you don't really know very well.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's right.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And as you can see, you're not really going into any deep personal questions.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's very light conversation, very brief as well.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I would like to add that in American culture, people often think it's very rude to ask someone how much do you earn, how much is your apartment, how much is your car.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So in small talk in American culture, and I think a lot of Western cultures, we don't talk about money or religion.

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So what religion are you?

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I think it's important to talk about things that are very, very simple.

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know, what do you do for a living?

200
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where do you live?

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How is the weather, these things?

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, yes.

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is exactly, I think, one of the main points that when you're learning a language such as English, not only to understand the language, but also the culture.

204
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's very, very different, especially, for example, in Asian cultures where it's no big deal if you go to the hairdresser and the hairdresser asks you how much you earn.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But in the United States or many Western countries, it's not something that you talk about your salary or that you really ask.

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's kind of personal information.

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It is, and if you talk about it, you might make people very uncomfortable.

208
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And so I recommend talking about some of the things that we've discussed here and some of the things that we've discussed in other lessons in this series about small talk.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's right.

210
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And if you have any questions or any comments about this lesson, you can come and visit us at EnglishPod.com.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We hope to see you guys there.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Until next time.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Bye.

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Bye.
