00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're going back to school.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right, we're talking about my least favorite subject.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That would be math.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so we're going to be talking about math.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now, I know that many of you, of course, know math.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But do you know the operations in English?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Many people find it hard to find the right words to talk about math in English.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And we'll also look at some names that you can call people who are really, really, really smart.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at those math words.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All right, children, let's review.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Tommy, pay attention.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sorry, Miss Kablek.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's four plus eleven?

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
15.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Miss Kablek always asks Crystal.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
She's such a teacher's pet.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And what about 56 minus 60?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Negative four.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Very good.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
12 times 12?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Very good.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Suck up.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
144.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Zero divided by one?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Zero.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
How did you know that?

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, smarty pants, the square root of two.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bet you're not going to get that one.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Do it all.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Um, um, one point four, one four, two, one three five.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right, so that's one smart little girl, huh?

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, pretty smart.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's actually smarter than me in math.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:05,000
All right, so let's take a look at some of those words that the teacher used to ask her about certain operations in language takeaway.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Language takeaway.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, so like we said, you guys know how to do math and you know the words in your language, but maybe in English it's a little bit harder to find the right words.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So let's look at those now.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, so let's look at the first question that she asked.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's four plus 11?

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Four plus 11.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, plus.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Plus.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right, so four plus 11, Erika, is?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let me take a look at here, um, 15.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
15.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, so we are adding, right?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So that's how you would say it.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go with an easy one.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Two plus two.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Four.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Four, right?

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Or five plus five.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ten.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ten, okay.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're really testing my skills.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So that's how you would add numbers.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now what about taking away numbers?

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So taking away or subtracting.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right, let's test you again.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
In the dialogue she said 56 minus 60.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
56 minus 60 equals negative four.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So take away minus, so that's negative, right?

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Minus.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, and of course if you have 56 apples and you take away 60, you are left with?

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Negative four.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Negative four.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, actually you're left with zero apples.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, exactly.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now, that answer is also interesting.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Negative four.

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Negative four.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That means minus four, right?

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Four less than zero.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Four less than zero.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Very good.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Negative four.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, so now for our next operation.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
12 times 12.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
12 times 12.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
12 times 12.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Now Marco, don't ask me the answer.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
All right, 12 times 12 equals 144.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now that's multiplying.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right, or multiplication.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Multiplication.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, so this times part, it's very easy to remember because, for example, four times four.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can just say four, the number four, and you add it, right?

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Four times.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Four times.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Four plus four plus four plus four.

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right, so times.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Times.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Uh-huh.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now the opposite of times.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All right, the opposite of multiplication is division.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Division.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so in our dialogue, the teacher said zero divided by one.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Zero divided by one.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Zero divided by one.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Any number divided by zero is zero.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right, so let's give another example.

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
15 divided by three.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right, so 15 divided by three equals?

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Five.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Five.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mm-hmm, exactly.

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So divided by.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Divided by.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Very good.

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So after division, the teacher was very impressed, and now she asked a very hard mathematical operation, especially for a girl this age.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The square root of two.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The square root of.

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Square root.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So let's give some examples to show what is the square root.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, so if I ask you the square root of nine.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Three.

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Three, right?

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What about the square root of four?

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Two.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Two, okay.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So now one more.

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The square root of 16.

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Four.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Four.

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Mm-hmm.

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, so you notice the pattern, right?

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I'm sure everyone knows this in their own language, how you would get a square root.

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Exactly.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So this language is pretty simple.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You all know it in your own language, but let's hear it again in English one more time with the dialogue.

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right, children, let's review.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Tommy, pay attention.

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sorry, Miss Kadlec.

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's four plus 11?

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Um, 15.

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Miss Kadlec always asks Crystal.

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She's such a teacher's pet.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, and what about 56 minus 60?

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Um, negative four.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Very good.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
12 times 12?

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Very good.

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Suck up.

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
144.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Zero divided by one?

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Zero.

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How did you know that?

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, smarty pants.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The square root of two.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Bet you're not going to get that one.

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do it all.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Um, um, 1.4, 1.4, 2.1.3.5.

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, so we understand the mathematical operations that we saw here.

166
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Very easy.

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mm-hmm.

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But now there was another little kid in there who was very, I think, envious or jealous.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, Tommy.

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Tommy, right?

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mm-hmm.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So, he called her a couple of different names.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Fluency Builder.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, so the first one that he called Crystal, the little girl, he called her a teacher's pet.

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Teacher's pet.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Teacher's pet.

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A teacher's pet.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, Erica, what exactly is a teacher's pet?

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It is the favorite student the teacher has in that class.

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right, so it's always the student that's helping the teacher.

182
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, the smartest student.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The teacher's pet.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, and it has a negative meaning in English.

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, I wouldn't say that it's a good thing to be the teacher's pet.

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Like, the teacher thinks it's good, but all of the friends and the classmates, they think it's bad.

188
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Teacher's pet.

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And similar to teacher's pet is a suck-up.

191
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Suck-up.

192
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Suck-up.

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Again, suck-up, what is a suck-up?

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A suck-up is a person who tries really, really hard to make the teacher like him.

195
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, now we can also use it outside of the classroom, right?

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, at work, maybe.

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, there is always at work, there is always one person who is the suck-up, right?

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Now, again, this has a negative meaning in English.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah, I guess in the workplace, the rest of your colleagues don't really like that person who's considered to be the suck-up, who's always trying to please the boss.

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Exactly.

201
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right.

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
All right, so the teacher calls Crystal a smarty-pants.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Smarty-pants.

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Smarty-pants.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay, so this is also a little name calling, right?

206
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So what is a smarty-pants?

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Somebody who is too smart.

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Too smart.

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Who tries too hard to be smart.

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now, this is only for little kids, right?

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I wouldn't call you a smarty-pants, right?

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, it's definitely for children, adults don't say this.

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Unless maybe you are joking or having fun with someone.

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, but if you say it, you are suggesting that you're being like a child.

215
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, smarty-pants.

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And our last one, and this is also a very good phrase and a way to describe someone, know-it-all.

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Know-it-all.

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Know-it-all.

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A know-it-all.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sometimes you say Mr.

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Know-it-all, right?

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, so what is a know-it-all?

224
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Somebody who tries to show everyone that they know it all.

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They know everything.

226
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, they're so smart.

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They have the answers to everything.

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But they really, really try and show everyone that they know everything.

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
These people can be sometimes a little bit irritating, right?

230
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, very, very annoying.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Annoying.

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Alright, so it's not a good thing to be a know-it-all all the time.

233
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, actually all of these phrases are not good things to be.

234
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue one more time and then we're going to come back and Eric is going to tell us how much she hates math.

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright, children, let's review.

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tommy, pay attention.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sorry, Ms.

238
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Kadlec.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What's four plus eleven?

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Um, fifteen.

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ms.

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Kadlec always asks Crystal.

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
She's such a teacher's pet.

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, and what about fifty-six minus sixty?

246
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Um, huh, negative four.

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Very good.

248
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Twelve times twelve?

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Very good.

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Suck up.

251
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
144.

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Zero divided by one?

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Zero.

254
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How did you know that?

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, smarty pants, the square root of two.

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Bet you're not going to get that one do-it-all.

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Um, um, one point four, one four, two one three five.

258
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Alright, so Erica, you were telling me that you hated math, or you still do.

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, yes, that's true.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I really do hate math and even doing a simple, you know, like sixteen plus thirty-two is too hard for me.

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So you were never really that type of person that's good with numbers.

262
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I'm terrible with numbers.

263
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't even remember my own phone number.

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Really?

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's true.

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Like, I really, if someone asks me for my phone number, I have to look on my phone in the address book to find it.

267
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, yeah, sometimes numbers can be difficult.

268
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I kind of liked math when I was younger.

269
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It just made sense.

270
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, I guess there's a reason why I'm an English teacher and not a math teacher.

271
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And I was actually not very good at language.

272
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But here you are.

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Exactly.

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, I mean, in Spanish, I like grammar, I'm not very good at that, all those rules.

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, but you're pretty good at English, so that's alright with me.

276
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's alright.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What about you guys?

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Tell us what your favorite subject or your least favorite subject in school was.

279
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What about you?

280
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you have any favorite subject?

281
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or did you have a favorite subject?

282
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
History.

283
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
History.

284
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah.

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay.

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I liked chemistry for a while.

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, God.

288
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Chemistry involves numbers.

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, a little bit, but it was interesting as well.

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So come to the website, everyone, EnglishPod.com, and you can find lots of other resources there.
