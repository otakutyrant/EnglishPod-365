00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,799
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,940
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,660
And today we're going back to school.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,759
That's right, we're talking about my least favorite subject.

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,660
That would be math.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,320
That's right.

8
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,920
Okay, so we're going to be talking about math.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,300
Now, I know that many of you, of course, know math.

10
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:23,879
Right.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,579
But do you know the operations in English?

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:33,500
Many people find it hard to find the right words to talk about math in English.

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,780
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,899
And we'll also look at some names that you can call people who are really, really, really smart.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,700
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at those math words.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,560
All right, children, let's review.

17
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,159
Tommy, pay attention.

18
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,659
Sorry, Miss Kablek.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,400
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,760
What's four plus eleven?

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:11,859
15.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,760
Miss Kablek always asks Crystal.

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,159
She's such a teacher's pet.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,340
Okay.

25
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,219
And what about 56 minus 60?

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,540
Negative four.

27
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:22,340
Very good.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,819
12 times 12?

29
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,659
Very good.

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:25,579
Suck up.

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,340
144.

32
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,319
Zero divided by one?

33
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,019
Zero.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,219
How did you know that?

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,620
Okay, smarty pants, the square root of two.

36
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:37,980
Bet you're not going to get that one.

37
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,719
Do it all.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,640
Um, um, one point four, one four, two, one three five.

39
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,200
All right, so that's one smart little girl, huh?

40
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,079
Yeah, pretty smart.

41
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,500
She's actually smarter than me in math.

42
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:05,980
All right, so let's take a look at some of those words that the teacher used to ask her about certain operations in language takeaway.

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,020
Language takeaway.

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:20,259
Okay, so like we said, you guys know how to do math and you know the words in your language, but maybe in English it's a little bit harder to find the right words.

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,460
So let's look at those now.

46
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,280
Okay, so let's look at the first question that she asked.

47
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,139
What's four plus 11?

48
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,979
Four plus 11.

49
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,219
Okay, plus.

50
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:33,919
Plus.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,800
All right, so four plus 11, Erika, is?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,719
Let me take a look at here, um, 15.

53
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,659
15.

54
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,479
Okay, so we are adding, right?

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:44,840
Yes.

56
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:45,860
So that's how you would say it.

57
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,879
Let's go with an easy one.

58
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,259
Two plus two.

59
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:48,819
Four.

60
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:49,680
Four, right?

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,800
Or five plus five.

62
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:52,680
Ten.

63
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:53,800
Ten, okay.

64
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,599
You're really testing my skills.

65
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,000
So that's how you would add numbers.

66
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,919
Now what about taking away numbers?

67
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,900
So taking away or subtracting.

68
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,800
All right, let's test you again.

69
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,479
In the dialogue she said 56 minus 60.

70
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:17,099
56 minus 60 equals negative four.

71
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:17,860
Okay.

72
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,780
So take away minus, so that's negative, right?

73
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,759
Minus.

74
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:27,939
So, and of course if you have 56 apples and you take away 60, you are left with?

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,039
Negative four.

76
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:29,819
Negative four.

77
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,659
Well, actually you're left with zero apples.

78
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:32,740
Yeah, exactly.

79
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,860
Now, that answer is also interesting.

80
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:35,939
Negative four.

81
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:36,960
Negative four.

82
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,360
That means minus four, right?

83
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,680
Four less than zero.

84
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,860
Four less than zero.

85
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,520
Very good.

86
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,520
Negative four.

87
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,659
Okay, so now for our next operation.

88
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,900
12 times 12.

89
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,599
12 times 12.

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,199
12 times 12.

91
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,919
Now Marco, don't ask me the answer.

92
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,319
All right, 12 times 12 equals 144.

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,560
Now that's multiplying.

94
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,360
Right, or multiplication.

95
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,159
Multiplication.

96
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:10,280
Okay, so this times part, it's very easy to remember because, for example, four times four.

97
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,560
You can just say four, the number four, and you add it, right?

98
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,460
Four times.

99
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,000
Four times.

100
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,259
Four plus four plus four plus four.

101
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,019
Right, so times.

102
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:20,879
Times.

103
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:21,660
Uh-huh.

104
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,300
Now the opposite of times.

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,860
All right, the opposite of multiplication is division.

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Division.

107
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,300
Okay, so in our dialogue, the teacher said zero divided by one.

108
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:36,199
Zero divided by one.

109
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,540
Zero divided by one.

110
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,839
Any number divided by zero is zero.

111
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,860
All right, so let's give another example.

112
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,379
15 divided by three.

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,180
All right, so 15 divided by three equals?

114
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:48,920
Five.

115
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:49,500
Five.

116
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,439
Mm-hmm, exactly.

117
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,699
So divided by.

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,839
Divided by.

119
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,019
Very good.

120
00:04:54,279 --> 00:05:02,339
So after division, the teacher was very impressed, and now she asked a very hard mathematical operation, especially for a girl this age.

121
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,019
The square root of two.

122
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,439
The square root of.

123
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,180
Square root.

124
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,540
So let's give some examples to show what is the square root.

125
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,939
Okay, so if I ask you the square root of nine.

126
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:18,839
Three.

127
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,920
Three, right?

128
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,259
Yes.

129
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,480
What about the square root of four?

130
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:24,439
Two.

131
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,620
Two, okay.

132
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,360
So now one more.

133
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,319
The square root of 16.

134
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,040
Four.

135
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:30,819
Four.

136
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,300
Mm-hmm.

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,759
Okay, so you notice the pattern, right?

138
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:37,639
And I'm sure everyone knows this in their own language, how you would get a square root.

139
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:38,319
Exactly.

140
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,339
So this language is pretty simple.

141
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,779
You all know it in your own language, but let's hear it again in English one more time with the dialogue.

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,379
All right, children, let's review.

143
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:56,959
Tommy, pay attention.

144
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,500
Sorry, Miss Kadlec.

145
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,300
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

146
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,800
What's four plus 11?

147
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:05,939
Um, 15.

148
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,680
Miss Kadlec always asks Crystal.

149
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,199
She's such a teacher's pet.

150
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:15,259
Okay, and what about 56 minus 60?

151
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,680
Um, negative four.

152
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,019
Very good.

153
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,519
12 times 12?

154
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,420
Very good.

155
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:23,379
Suck up.

156
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,180
144.

157
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,180
Zero divided by one?

158
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:27,959
Zero.

159
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:30,199
How did you know that?

160
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,860
Okay, smarty pants.

161
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,639
The square root of two.

162
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,040
Bet you're not going to get that one.

163
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:36,860
Do it all.

164
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:42,120
Um, um, 1.4, 1.4, 2.1.3.5.

165
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,639
Okay, so we understand the mathematical operations that we saw here.

166
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,300
Very easy.

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:50,779
Mm-hmm.

168
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,379
But now there was another little kid in there who was very, I think, envious or jealous.

169
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,220
Yeah, Tommy.

170
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,240
Tommy, right?

171
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:57,920
Mm-hmm.

172
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,720
So, he called her a couple of different names.

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,819
Well, let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

174
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,300
Fluency Builder.

175
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,759
Okay, so the first one that he called Crystal, the little girl, he called her a teacher's pet.

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,720
Teacher's pet.

177
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,860
Teacher's pet.

178
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:15,779
A teacher's pet.

179
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,639
So, Erica, what exactly is a teacher's pet?

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,639
It is the favorite student the teacher has in that class.

181
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:25,600
All right, so it's always the student that's helping the teacher.

182
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,939
Yeah, the smartest student.

183
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:27,379
Yeah.

184
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:28,800
The teacher's pet.

185
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,939
Yeah, and it has a negative meaning in English.

186
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,160
Yeah, I wouldn't say that it's a good thing to be the teacher's pet.

187
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,620
Like, the teacher thinks it's good, but all of the friends and the classmates, they think it's bad.

188
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:41,639
Yeah, exactly.

189
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,500
Teacher's pet.

190
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:46,420
And similar to teacher's pet is a suck-up.

191
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,620
Suck-up.

192
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,540
Suck-up.

193
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,339
Again, suck-up, what is a suck-up?

194
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:57,500
A suck-up is a person who tries really, really hard to make the teacher like him.

195
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay, now we can also use it outside of the classroom, right?

196
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,660
Yeah, at work, maybe.

197
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,220
Okay, there is always at work, there is always one person who is the suck-up, right?

198
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,240
Now, again, this has a negative meaning in English.

199
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:18,720
Yeah, I guess in the workplace, the rest of your colleagues don't really like that person who's considered to be the suck-up, who's always trying to please the boss.

200
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,519
Exactly.

201
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,339
All right.

202
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:25,560
All right, so the teacher calls Crystal a smarty-pants.

203
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,740
Smarty-pants.

204
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:28,279
Smarty-pants.

205
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,639
Okay, so this is also a little name calling, right?

206
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,200
So what is a smarty-pants?

207
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,279
Somebody who is too smart.

208
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:35,899
Too smart.

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,779
Who tries too hard to be smart.

210
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,559
Now, this is only for little kids, right?

211
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,320
I wouldn't call you a smarty-pants, right?

212
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,159
No, it's definitely for children, adults don't say this.

213
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,179
Unless maybe you are joking or having fun with someone.

214
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:52,340
Yeah, but if you say it, you are suggesting that you're being like a child.

215
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,399
Okay, smarty-pants.

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,840
And our last one, and this is also a very good phrase and a way to describe someone, know-it-all.

217
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:02,860
Know-it-all.

218
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,139
Know-it-all.

219
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:05,100
A know-it-all.

220
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,720
Sometimes you say Mr.

221
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,539
Know-it-all, right?

222
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,059
Yeah, that's right.

223
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,779
Okay, so what is a know-it-all?

224
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,799
Somebody who tries to show everyone that they know it all.

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,860
They know everything.

226
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,899
Yeah, they're so smart.

227
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:18,299
They have the answers to everything.

228
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
But they really, really try and show everyone that they know everything.

229
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,779
These people can be sometimes a little bit irritating, right?

230
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,559
Yeah, very, very annoying.

231
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,580
Annoying.

232
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:32,980
Alright, so it's not a good thing to be a know-it-all all the time.

233
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,360
Yeah, actually all of these phrases are not good things to be.

234
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:45,080
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue one more time and then we're going to come back and Eric is going to tell us how much she hates math.

235
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,940
Alright, children, let's review.

236
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,519
Tommy, pay attention.

237
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,639
Sorry, Ms.

238
00:09:58,779 --> 00:09:59,000
Kadlec.

239
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,740
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

240
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:04,120
What's four plus eleven?

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,259
Um, fifteen.

242
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:06,840
Ms.

243
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,120
Kadlec always asks Crystal.

244
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,519
She's such a teacher's pet.

245
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,559
Okay, and what about fifty-six minus sixty?

246
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,919
Um, huh, negative four.

247
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:16,679
Very good.

248
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,139
Twelve times twelve?

249
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,059
Very good.

250
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,000
Suck up.

251
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:20,600
144.

252
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,659
Zero divided by one?

253
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,399
Zero.

254
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,580
How did you know that?

255
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,960
Okay, smarty pants, the square root of two.

256
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,039
Bet you're not going to get that one do-it-all.

257
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,639
Um, um, one point four, one four, two one three five.

258
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:46,299
Alright, so Erica, you were telling me that you hated math, or you still do.

259
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,179
Well, yes, that's true.

260
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:56,139
I really do hate math and even doing a simple, you know, like sixteen plus thirty-two is too hard for me.

261
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,000
So you were never really that type of person that's good with numbers.

262
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,279
No, I'm terrible with numbers.

263
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
I can't even remember my own phone number.

264
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:04,700
Really?

265
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,379
That's true.

266
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:12,340
Like, I really, if someone asks me for my phone number, I have to look on my phone in the address book to find it.

267
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,840
Well, yeah, sometimes numbers can be difficult.

268
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,799
I kind of liked math when I was younger.

269
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,700
It just made sense.

270
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, I guess there's a reason why I'm an English teacher and not a math teacher.

271
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:27,039
And I was actually not very good at language.

272
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,259
But here you are.

273
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,799
Exactly.

274
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,659
Well, I mean, in Spanish, I like grammar, I'm not very good at that, all those rules.

275
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,120
Yeah, but you're pretty good at English, so that's alright with me.

276
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,440
That's alright.

277
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,659
What about you guys?

278
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,580
Tell us what your favorite subject or your least favorite subject in school was.

279
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:43,440
What about you?

280
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,659
Do you have any favorite subject?

281
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,580
Or did you have a favorite subject?

282
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,360
History.

283
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:47,919
History.

284
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:48,419
Yeah.

285
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,019
Okay.

286
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,879
I liked chemistry for a while.

287
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:51,480
Oh, God.

288
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,200
Chemistry involves numbers.

289
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:56,620
Well, a little bit, but it was interesting as well.

290
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,460
So come to the website, everyone, EnglishPod.com, and you can find lots of other resources there.

292
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,259
That's right.
