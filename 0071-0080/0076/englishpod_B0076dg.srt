EnglishPod.com Alright, children, let's review.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Tommy, pay attention.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sorry, Ms.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Kablek.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What's 4 plus 11?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Um, 15.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ms.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Kablek always asks Crystal.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
She's such a teacher's pet.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, and what about 56 minus 60?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Um, huh, negative 4.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Very good.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
12 times 12?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Very good.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Suck up.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
144.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Zero divided by 1?

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Zero.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How did you know that?

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, smarty pants, the square root of 2.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Bet you're not going to get that one do-it-all.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Um, um, 1.4, 1.4, 2.135.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Music.
