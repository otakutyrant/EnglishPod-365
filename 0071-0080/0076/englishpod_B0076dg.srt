EnglishPod.com Alright, children, let's review.

2
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,320
Tommy, pay attention.

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:14,439
Sorry, Ms.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:14,820
Kablek.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,640
Okay, Crystal, now tell me.

6
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,960
What's 4 plus 11?

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,059
Um, 15.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:22,719
Ms.

9
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:23,920
Kablek always asks Crystal.

10
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,339
She's such a teacher's pet.

11
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:29,440
Okay, and what about 56 minus 60?

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,719
Um, huh, negative 4.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,500
Very good.

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:33,960
12 times 12?

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,859
Very good.

16
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:35,740
Suck up.

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:36,399
144.

18
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,460
Zero divided by 1?

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,179
Zero.

20
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,359
How did you know that?

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,759
Okay, smarty pants, the square root of 2.

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,820
Bet you're not going to get that one do-it-all.

23
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:53,340
Um, um, 1.4, 1.4, 2.135.

24
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,679
Music.
