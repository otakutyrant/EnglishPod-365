00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,839
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:05,919
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:06,980
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,939
And today we have a special lesson for all our sci-fi or science fiction fans.

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:17,679
Yes, and actually one special user was the inspiration for this lesson.

7
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,059
Right.

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:18,679
Wolfgang.

9
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:19,800
Exactly.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,000
This one is for you.

11
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,440
Well, sci-fi is very popular.

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,079
Star Trek, Star Wars.

13
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:25,420
Yep.

14
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:37,179
And, well, there are some really interesting words that, well, maybe you wouldn't use in real life or in normal circumstances, but you do want to understand these movies or why they say these words, right?

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,759
So we're going to look at some sci-fi language in this lesson.

16
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:45,700
But we've, before we start, let's look at vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,799
Vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,780
And in vocabulary preview today we have one phrase only.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,439
That's right.

20
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,100
Unidentified spacecraft.

21
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,679
Unidentified spacecraft.

22
00:00:57,939 --> 00:00:59,219
Unidentified spacecraft.

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,479
Okay, so unidentified.

24
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,740
You don't know which one it is.

25
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,659
You don't know the name.

26
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,340
Yeah.

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,519
You don't know the identity.

28
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:06,980
Yes.

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,659
Okay.

30
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:08,799
And a spacecraft.

31
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,599
A spacecraft is a vehicle that travels in space.

32
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:13,260
Okay.

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,159
Also known as a spaceship.

34
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:15,840
That's right.

35
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,400
Actually, this is interesting because you know the word UFO.

36
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,079
Yes.

37
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,939
That's, that comes from.

38
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,200
Unidentified flying object.

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,079
Exactly.

40
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:29,280
So unidentified spacecraft and an unknown vehicle flying in space.

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:29,719
Right.

42
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:30,459
A UFO.

43
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,540
Have you ever seen a UFO?

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,420
No.

45
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:33,120
Oh.

46
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,540
Yeah.

47
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,079
That's too bad.

48
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,239
Have you?

49
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,620
Of course.

50
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:37,319
Hasn't anyone?

51
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,219
All right.

52
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,239
Well, I think the people in our dialogue may or may not have seen a UFO.

53
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:43,900
So why don't we take a listen.

54
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,420
They are breaking through.

55
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,459
Search your blasters to full power.

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,400
Excellent job.

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,740
Search the ship.

58
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,819
She's gotta be in here somewhere.

59
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,699
Bring her to me.

60
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,939
Lord, we have a survivor here.

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,539
Where is she?

62
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,780
Don't make me destroy you.

63
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,259
Tell me where she is.

64
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:32,840
Not so fast.

65
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,039
She will no longer be a prisoner.

66
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,500
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

67
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,460
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

68
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:59,740
You know nothing of the past.

69
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,099
We will stop you.

70
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,020
Lord Hager, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

71
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,099
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,919
After them.

73
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,580
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

74
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,039
We lost them, sir.

75
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:40,159
Okay, so a really cool Lord Hager, huh?

76
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,759
The music and everything.

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,080
Well, you may have noticed that it's similar to a certain movie out there.

78
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,099
I don't know.

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,539
I mean, it seems quite original to me.

80
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,939
But everything for educational purposes.

81
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,639
That's right.

82
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,719
Okay, so we saw some words that were maybe a little bit difficult.

83
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,300
So let's take a look at these now in Language Takeaway.

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,180
Language Takeaway.

85
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,020
Well, I guess in the dialogue, the bad guys were breaking through.

86
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,259
Breaking through.

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,379
Breaking through.

88
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,100
In the simple present, it would be to break through.

89
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,240
Okay, breakthrough.

90
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,279
And what does that mean?

91
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,339
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us find out.

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,620
Example one.

93
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,579
After 15 minutes, the workers broke through the wall and rescued everyone from the fire.

94
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,660
Example two.

95
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,379
He is such a good player.

96
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,300
He broke through the entire defense.

97
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,180
Example three.

98
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,540
They are breaking through our impenetrable wall.

99
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:53,540
Run!

100
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,180
All right, so it's kind of like to enter by force somewhere.

101
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,439
Yeah, to maybe break some glass and come into a room or something like that.

102
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,240
Break through.

103
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,800
Yeah.

104
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,779
All right, so Lord Hager had a enemy and he said he wants to settle this.

105
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,680
To settle this.

106
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Settle.

107
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:17,279
So what do you do when you settle something?

108
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,079
Well, when you settle something is you end a fight or a dispute.

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,060
Or an argument.

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,899
Or an argument or a problem.

111
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,500
Yeah, when you settle an argument, does everyone always agree?

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,560
No, not always, right?

113
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:30,920
Right.

114
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,379
Sometimes you are forced to agree.

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,120
Okay.

116
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,240
Not everyone agrees but you have no other choice.

117
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,680
So it's a little bit different from reaching an agreement because there's usually a winner and a loser.

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,939
Right, exactly.

119
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,980
Well, now another very popular word and within sci-fi is this word tractor beam.

120
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,120
Tractor beam.

121
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,420
A tractor beam.

122
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,540
Tractor beam.

123
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,500
Now, I'm not sure if this really exists in real life.

124
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,720
Well, I've never heard of it.

125
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:09,500
But a tractor beam in sci-fi movies is like this invisible force that grabs an object and doesn't let it escape and brings it towards another spaceship.

126
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,220
So it's like almost like a rope that you can't see.

127
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,660
Right, and it brings it in.

128
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,139
So the spaceship managed to escape their tractor beam.

129
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,420
Okay, I think that is definitely not true.

130
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,040
Well, maybe, I don't know but in sci-fi you always hear this tractor beam.

131
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:28,500
Okay, now let's move on to our final word.

132
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:32,579
The spaceship was accelerating towards the speed of light.

133
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,600
Accelerating.

134
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,040
Accelerating.

135
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,199
To accelerate.

136
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:37,079
That's right.

137
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,240
So that means to increase speed, right?

138
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,399
Yeah, just to go faster.

139
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,100
To go faster.

140
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,300
So if you are in your car, you want to accelerate so you can pass another car.

141
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,839
Okay, or even when you stop at a red light and it turns green.

142
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,019
You got to accelerate.

143
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,600
Okay, to accelerate.

144
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,879
Let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and take a look at some of the phrases that came up in this dialogue.

145
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,639
They are breaking through.

146
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:09,540
Central blasters to full power.

147
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,579
Excellent job.

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,939
Search the ship.

149
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,980
She's got to be in here somewhere.

150
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,480
Bring her to me.

151
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,519
Lord hate her.

152
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,699
We have a survivor here.

153
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:21,279
Where is she?

154
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,300
Don't make me destroy you.

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,420
Tell me where she is.

156
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,279
Not so fast.

157
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,480
She will no longer be a prisoner.

158
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:34,120
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

159
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,540
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

160
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,300
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,300
We will stop you.

162
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,019
Lord hate her.

163
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,019
We have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

164
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,639
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam after them.

165
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,000
They are accelerating towards the speed of light.

166
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
We lost them, sir.

167
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,019
Well, great.

168
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,279
Well, great.

169
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:20,639
I think that's a little bit more clear this time, but like Marco said, I want to look at now some phrases that you might hear in a sci-fi context.

170
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,040
Fluency builder.

171
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:27,839
The first phrase that we can take a look at and maybe it looks a little bit strange.

172
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,000
He said she will no longer be your prisoner.

173
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,779
No longer be.

174
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,580
No longer be.

175
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,779
So what does he mean by no longer?

176
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:39,259
Anymore.

177
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,179
Anymore, right.

178
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,860
So you will not be my prisoner anymore.

179
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Okay.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,259
So how would I use it in this form?

181
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,200
No longer be.

182
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,159
You've always got to use it in the future tense.

183
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,919
Okay.

184
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,720
So she'll no longer be your prisoner.

185
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,379
I will no longer be your employee.

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,100
Okay.

187
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,100
Or I can say I will no longer be your boyfriend.

188
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:01,500
Okay.

189
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,059
So it's always will no longer be.

190
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,899
It's always in the future.

191
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Okay.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,679
One more thing, Marco.

193
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,120
Is this quite commonly used or maybe a little bit formal?

194
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,059
I think it's a little bit formal and it's very, I don't know, to a certain point poetic.

195
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah.

196
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,519
Which I think is why we hear it a little bit more often in sci-fi movies.

197
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:20,659
All right.

198
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,980
So no longer be.

199
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:23,500
What about our next phrase?

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,980
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

201
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,460
Okay.

202
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,759
You know nothing.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,519
You know nothing of.

204
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,220
So again, it's very poetic.

205
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:33,720
Yeah.

206
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,320
Basically meaning you don't know about.

207
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,200
You don't know about.

208
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:37,500
Yeah.

209
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,940
So again, let's take a look at how you would use it.

210
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,320
You know nothing of and then science fiction.

211
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,980
You know nothing of science fiction.

212
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:46,320
Yeah.

213
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:49,000
So you would use a noun afterwards.

214
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:49,659
Exactly.

215
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,240
Okay.

216
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,559
So interesting phrases.

217
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,899
Again, formal and probably quite often used in science fiction movies.

218
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:06,860
But now you can understand when they use some of these words that maybe are a little bit difficult and very common in these types of movies.

219
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,779
Now let's go to our last phrase and then this one actually can be used in many different circumstances.

220
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,320
Let's settle this once and for all.

221
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:15,940
Okay.

222
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,039
So we saw the verb.

223
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,600
So we saw the word settle already.

224
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,179
Now let's settle this once and for all.

225
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:24,740
Once and for all.

226
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:25,539
So what does that mean?

227
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,659
Finally.

228
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,399
That's right.

229
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:27,899
Forever.

230
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:28,659
Okay.

231
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,779
So once and for all.

232
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,279
Forever.

233
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,980
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use this phrase once and for all in different contexts.

234
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,139
Example one.

235
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,440
I'm fed up with arguing about this.

236
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,659
Let's just settle the argument once and for all.

237
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:49,460
Example two.

238
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,059
He claims his photographs prove once and for all that UFOs do exist.

239
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:59,179
Example three.

240
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,659
I told him once and for all that I don't want to be his girlfriend anymore.

241
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay.

242
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,440
So now I think it's clear.

243
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,440
We've, we've seen a lot of words.

244
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,940
We've seen a lot of phrases.

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,940
Let's listen to our dialogue one more time.

246
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,879
They are breaking through.

247
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,659
Search your blasters to full power.

248
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:44,840
Excellent job.

249
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,179
Search the ship.

250
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,259
She's got to be in here somewhere.

251
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,759
Bring her to me.

252
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:55,079
Lord Hater, we have a survivor here.

253
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,980
Where is she?

254
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,220
Don't make me destroy you.

255
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,379
Tell me where she is.

256
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,279
Not so fast.

257
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,480
She will no longer be a prisoner.

258
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,100
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

259
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,980
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

260
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,639
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

261
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,620
We will stop you.

262
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,480
Lord Hater, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

263
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,539
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

264
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,419
After them.

265
00:12:47,979 --> 00:12:50,059
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

266
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,519
We lost them, sir.

267
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,279
Okay.

268
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,139
So are you a big sci-fi fan?

269
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:11,559
I think as you can tell, no.

270
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,299
Actually, I've seen some of Star Wars movies, but everyone that I've watched, I've fallen asleep in the middle of.

271
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:17,840
Really?

272
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Yeah.

273
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:19,220
Even in the movie theater.

274
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,899
I fell asleep in the movie theater watching Star Wars.

275
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:23,320
Wow.

276
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,080
Was it too boring?

277
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:24,940
It was too boring.

278
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,559
Oh, you're not really into the fantasy side.

279
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:27,820
No.

280
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,440
The whole time I'm sitting there going, this cannot happen.

281
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,779
Well, that's why it's called science fiction, right?

282
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,360
Yes.

283
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,740
But it is interesting to some people.

284
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,659
And well, behind Star Wars, there is a huge culture.

285
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:50,000
Even some people know some of the languages or symbols that are used in it or the names of some of the robots and models of spacecraft.

286
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,179
Well, maybe we'll have to come up with Star Wars pod.

287
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:54,539
Exactly.

288
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,639
Well, that's all for today, guys.

289
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,240
I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

290
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:04,279
And of course, if you have questions or comments, you can leave them in a comment section on our website, EnglishPod.com.

291
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:05,620
Well, thanks for listening, you guys.

292
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,639
And until next time, goodbye.
