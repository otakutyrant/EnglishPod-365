00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we have a special lesson for all our sci-fi or science fiction fans.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, and actually one special user was the inspiration for this lesson.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Right.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wolfgang.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This one is for you.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, sci-fi is very popular.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Star Trek, Star Wars.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yep.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And, well, there are some really interesting words that, well, maybe you wouldn't use in real life or in normal circumstances, but you do want to understand these movies or why they say these words, right?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we're going to look at some sci-fi language in this lesson.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But we've, before we start, let's look at vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And in vocabulary preview today we have one phrase only.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Unidentified spacecraft.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Unidentified spacecraft.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Unidentified spacecraft.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so unidentified.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You don't know which one it is.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You don't know the name.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You don't know the identity.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And a spacecraft.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A spacecraft is a vehicle that travels in space.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Also known as a spaceship.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Actually, this is interesting because you know the word UFO.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's, that comes from.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Unidentified flying object.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Exactly.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So unidentified spacecraft and an unknown vehicle flying in space.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Right.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A UFO.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Have you ever seen a UFO?

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah.

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's too bad.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Have you?

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Of course.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hasn't anyone?

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right.

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I think the people in our dialogue may or may not have seen a UFO.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So why don't we take a listen.

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They are breaking through.

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Search your blasters to full power.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Excellent job.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Search the ship.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She's gotta be in here somewhere.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Bring her to me.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Lord, we have a survivor here.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where is she?

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't make me destroy you.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tell me where she is.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Not so fast.

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She will no longer be a prisoner.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know nothing of the past.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We will stop you.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Lord Hager, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
After them.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We lost them, sir.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, so a really cool Lord Hager, huh?

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The music and everything.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, you may have noticed that it's similar to a certain movie out there.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I mean, it seems quite original to me.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But everything for educational purposes.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so we saw some words that were maybe a little bit difficult.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So let's take a look at these now in Language Takeaway.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Language Takeaway.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, I guess in the dialogue, the bad guys were breaking through.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Breaking through.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Breaking through.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In the simple present, it would be to break through.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, breakthrough.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And what does that mean?

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us find out.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Example one.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
After 15 minutes, the workers broke through the wall and rescued everyone from the fire.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Example two.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He is such a good player.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He broke through the entire defense.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Example three.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They are breaking through our impenetrable wall.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Run!

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right, so it's kind of like to enter by force somewhere.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, to maybe break some glass and come into a room or something like that.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Break through.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right, so Lord Hager had a enemy and he said he wants to settle this.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
To settle this.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Settle.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So what do you do when you settle something?

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, when you settle something is you end a fight or a dispute.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or an argument.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Or an argument or a problem.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, when you settle an argument, does everyone always agree?

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, not always, right?

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sometimes you are forced to agree.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Not everyone agrees but you have no other choice.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's a little bit different from reaching an agreement because there's usually a winner and a loser.

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right, exactly.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, now another very popular word and within sci-fi is this word tractor beam.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tractor beam.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A tractor beam.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tractor beam.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, I'm not sure if this really exists in real life.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, I've never heard of it.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But a tractor beam in sci-fi movies is like this invisible force that grabs an object and doesn't let it escape and brings it towards another spaceship.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So it's like almost like a rope that you can't see.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Right, and it brings it in.

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So the spaceship managed to escape their tractor beam.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, I think that is definitely not true.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, maybe, I don't know but in sci-fi you always hear this tractor beam.

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, now let's move on to our final word.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The spaceship was accelerating towards the speed of light.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Accelerating.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Accelerating.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To accelerate.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So that means to increase speed, right?

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, just to go faster.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To go faster.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So if you are in your car, you want to accelerate so you can pass another car.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, or even when you stop at a red light and it turns green.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You got to accelerate.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, to accelerate.

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and take a look at some of the phrases that came up in this dialogue.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They are breaking through.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Central blasters to full power.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Excellent job.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Search the ship.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Bring her to me.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Lord hate her.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We have a survivor here.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Where is she?

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't make me destroy you.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Tell me where she is.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Not so fast.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
She will no longer be a prisoner.

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We will stop you.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Lord hate her.

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam after them.

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
They are accelerating towards the speed of light.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We lost them, sir.

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, great.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, great.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think that's a little bit more clear this time, but like Marco said, I want to look at now some phrases that you might hear in a sci-fi context.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Fluency builder.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The first phrase that we can take a look at and maybe it looks a little bit strange.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He said she will no longer be your prisoner.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No longer be.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No longer be.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So what does he mean by no longer?

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Anymore.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Anymore, right.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you will not be my prisoner anymore.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So how would I use it in this form?

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No longer be.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You've always got to use it in the future tense.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So she'll no longer be your prisoner.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will no longer be your employee.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Or I can say I will no longer be your boyfriend.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So it's always will no longer be.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's always in the future.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
One more thing, Marco.

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is this quite commonly used or maybe a little bit formal?

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I think it's a little bit formal and it's very, I don't know, to a certain point poetic.

195
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Which I think is why we hear it a little bit more often in sci-fi movies.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All right.

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So no longer be.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What about our next phrase?

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know nothing.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You know nothing of.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So again, it's very poetic.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Basically meaning you don't know about.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You don't know about.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So again, let's take a look at how you would use it.

210
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You know nothing of and then science fiction.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You know nothing of science fiction.

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

213
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So you would use a noun afterwards.

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Exactly.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So interesting phrases.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Again, formal and probably quite often used in science fiction movies.

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But now you can understand when they use some of these words that maybe are a little bit difficult and very common in these types of movies.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now let's go to our last phrase and then this one actually can be used in many different circumstances.

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's settle this once and for all.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So we saw the verb.

223
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So we saw the word settle already.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Now let's settle this once and for all.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Once and for all.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So what does that mean?

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Finally.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Forever.

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So once and for all.

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Forever.

233
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use this phrase once and for all in different contexts.

234
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Example one.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm fed up with arguing about this.

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's just settle the argument once and for all.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Example two.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He claims his photographs prove once and for all that UFOs do exist.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Example three.

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I told him once and for all that I don't want to be his girlfriend anymore.

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So now I think it's clear.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We've, we've seen a lot of words.

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We've seen a lot of phrases.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one more time.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They are breaking through.

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Search your blasters to full power.

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Excellent job.

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Search the ship.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
She's got to be in here somewhere.

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Bring her to me.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Lord Hater, we have a survivor here.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where is she?

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't make me destroy you.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tell me where she is.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Not so fast.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She will no longer be a prisoner.

258
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We will stop you.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Lord Hater, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
After them.

265
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We lost them, sir.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Okay.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So are you a big sci-fi fan?

269
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think as you can tell, no.

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Actually, I've seen some of Star Wars movies, but everyone that I've watched, I've fallen asleep in the middle of.

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Really?

272
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Even in the movie theater.

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I fell asleep in the movie theater watching Star Wars.

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Wow.

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Was it too boring?

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It was too boring.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, you're not really into the fantasy side.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The whole time I'm sitting there going, this cannot happen.

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, that's why it's called science fiction, right?

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes.

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But it is interesting to some people.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And well, behind Star Wars, there is a huge culture.

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Even some people know some of the languages or symbols that are used in it or the names of some of the robots and models of spacecraft.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well, maybe we'll have to come up with Star Wars pod.

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Exactly.

288
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, that's all for today, guys.

289
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And of course, if you have questions or comments, you can leave them in a comment section on our website, EnglishPod.com.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, thanks for listening, you guys.

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And until next time, goodbye.
