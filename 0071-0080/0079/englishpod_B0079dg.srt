1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They are breaking through.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Search your blasters to full power.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Excellent job.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Search the ship.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
She's gotta be in here somewhere.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Bring her to me.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Lord Hater, we have a survivor here.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Where is she?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't make me destroy you.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tell me where she is.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Not so fast.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She will no longer be a prisoner.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We will stop you.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Lord Hater, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
After them.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We lost them, sir.
