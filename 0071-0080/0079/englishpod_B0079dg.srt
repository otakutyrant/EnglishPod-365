1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,380
They are breaking through.

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:12,339
Search your blasters to full power.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,320
Excellent job.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:22,679
Search the ship.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,780
She's gotta be in here somewhere.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,719
Bring her to me.

7
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,980
Lord Hater, we have a survivor here.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,479
Where is she?

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,719
Don't make me destroy you.

10
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:40,820
Tell me where she is.

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,780
Not so fast.

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,979
She will no longer be a prisoner.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,780
It's time you and I settled this once and for all.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
You are unwise to think you can defeat me.

15
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,640
You know nothing of the power of the obscure side.

16
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,219
We will stop you.

17
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,980
Lord Hater, we have an unidentified spacecraft taking off from the rear dock.

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,060
They somehow managed to escape our tractor beam.

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,879
After them.

20
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,540
They're accelerating towards the speed of light.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,659
We lost them, sir.
