1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're bringing you an advanced lesson for all of our advanced learners out there.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And in this lesson, we're visiting a history class.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, we're going to be talking about a very interesting topic that's known around the world, which is International Workers' Day.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And we're going to learn a little bit about the history of the workers' movement in the United States.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Right.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But we're also going to be taking a look at some great words and, of course, a little bit more advanced or complicated structures.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's right.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So I guess without further ado, we can get started with the dialogue.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All right, everyone, settle down.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's get started.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This brings me to our topic for today.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Cinco de Mayo.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, May 1st is International Workers' Day.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do we get a day off from school then?

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the U.S., but in other countries it is.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, man.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work 10, 12, and 14 hours a day.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Support for the eight-hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Cool.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But the happy ending came at a high price.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works factory, killing four and wounding many.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then what happened?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right, so we were in a history class and we learned something new, something interesting, right?

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, International Workers Day.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's not celebrated in the US, but in many other countries it is.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right, on May 1st, a lot of people have a day off, so that's always good.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, so why don't we take a look at some of the words that we saw in this dialogue, which were maybe a little bit different or difficult in language takeaway.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Language takeaway.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, we're just going to look at five words here.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And the first one, we talked about the Genesis of the movement.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Right, Genesis.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Genesis.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, so many of you may know that Genesis is a book in the Bible, right?

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And that's where this word comes from.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's the first book in the Bible.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So it's the beginning.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or the origin.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Origin.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So that's a Genesis.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So the Genesis of our legal system, you would say.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right, or the Genesis of this problem.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So it's the origin.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, it's a little bit of a formal word, isn't it?

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, I guess maybe you can say the origin or the beginning.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah, but maybe in an academic setting you can talk about the Genesis.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes, very good.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right, what do we have next?

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, one of the reasons why the workers movement got started was because of the appalling working conditions.

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Appalling.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Appalling.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If something is appalling...

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Shockingly bad.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Very, very bad.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So now if something is appalling, like the working conditions were appalling, you would feel appalled.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Exactly.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm appalled at your behavior.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, so it's almost like you are disgusted.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Very, very strong word.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, very strong.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, so the working conditions were appalling and people were setting up this movement, right?

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But what happened?

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They met some hostility.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hostility.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hostility.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hostility from the police, right?

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So what is hostility?

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hostility is the state of receiving an unfriendly reaction.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They acted in a very unfriendly way and it also suggests a hint of violence even.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So if somebody is hostile, they can maybe be aggressive and maybe to a point violent.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, so a hostile person.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, or a hostile environment, a dangerous environment.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay, hostility, hostile.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Very good.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Now because of these appalling working conditions, the labor movement decided to take drastic measures.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Drastic measures.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, drastic measures.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is a really wonderful phrase and I think it would help us to listen to a few examples of this phrase in use.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Example one.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The president was faced with some difficult decisions and was forced to take drastic measures to solve the crisis.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Example two.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The police took very drastic measures to control the protesters outside the government palace.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So we understand drastic measures as extreme actions or decisions, right?

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, exactly.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think there's a saying that says desperate times call for drastic measures.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, desperate times call for desperate measures.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Uh-huh.

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Dang.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, okay, but it goes around there somewhere, right?

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Something like that.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So if you really have an emergency, you need to do something drastic.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You have to take drastic measures or you can even say take drastic action.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, very good.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And what about our last word?

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
After the protests ended in violence, people started to get angry because of the brutality the police showed.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, brutality.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Brutality.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So again, maybe brutality and hostility are maybe similar, right?

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
A little bit similar.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So brutality is the state of being harsh or very forceful.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, so brutality.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, we also use the word brutal.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Right, so that means harsh or very forceful.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, sometimes we can use that word but not in a harsh or forceful way, right?

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yeah, and it's quite, yeah, I might say something like, oh my god, that test was brutal.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Uh-huh, it was brutal or...

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So it was really hard or really difficult.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right, so that's what you're saying with this word, that it's very hard or it was very intense.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, maybe one more example.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, so for example, I can say, oh, I went for a run today and it was brutal.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm so tired.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it was really difficult.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, brutal.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And Marco, is this something that's used by everyone?

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That phrase, brutal, using in that context would be for younger people maybe, not really, you wouldn't really hear older people using it.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So it's a little bit slangy.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, great, great.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So those are five interesting vocabulary words.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As Marco mentioned, we want to look at some more difficult structures now in Fluency Builder.

147
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, so we have some phrases that we saw in this dialogue and well, let's start with the first one.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, the teacher opens his discussion by talking about how an understanding of the legal system is an important aspect of being a good citizen.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, an important aspect.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
An important aspect.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So well, maybe we know the word important, right?

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So what's an aspect?

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A part of something, an important part of something.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, so the teacher started with an important aspect of and then specified the idea or what part it belongs to.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right, so it usually follows this form.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Noun is an important aspect of noun.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So for example, quality control is an important aspect of keeping customers happy.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay, perfect.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
A part of.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Very good.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So aspect sounds a little bit more formal or just a lot more intelligent, right?

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, professional.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And actually this is a wonderful way of setting up your idea.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So the teacher said that it's an important aspect of understanding the legal system was understanding its origins or its genesis.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yep.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then she moved on and said that it's not enough to simply memorize laws.

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's right.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's not enough to simply do something.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, so the beginning of this sentence, it is not enough to simply something.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
By starting a sentence like this, you are indicating that more is required, right?

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So here, it's not enough to simply memorize the laws.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're saying that most people just memorize the laws, but they need to go further.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And understand them.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Exactly.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Another example would be, it's not enough to simply pass your exams.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You must get good grades as well.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Or maybe in a business context, it's not enough to simply satisfy your customers.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You must impress them.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Very good.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So that's a very good way of starting out this idea of more is required.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
More is required.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
All right.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, I want to move on to one final point here.

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I found this sentence to be really, really interesting.

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So why is this interesting?

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, I found that, you know, there's two verbs going on here.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They passed a resolution that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So we've got two verb times going on here at the same time.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And I'm wondering about this one, would.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So what's happening here?

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Obviously, this happened in the past.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's like about a hundred years ago, right?

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Right.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So the resolution was passed a hundred years ago.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So this is going on in the past.

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But there was a future action that was going to happen in consequence of this.

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So the resolution stated that eight hours would constitute.

209
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So it's like the primary action was the passing of the resolution.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And the result is this sort of this event that happens in the past, but is a future event to the first primary event.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Does that make any sense at all?

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So this is called the future in the past, right?

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So it's a it's a grammar structure.

216
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Many of you maybe know the simple present or the or the future tenses, but this is a little strange one.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And as we said, so maybe it's a little bit difficult to understand the grammar in general.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So why don't we take a look at some more examples of how we would use this future in the past?

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Example one.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The president said that he would cut taxes by five percent.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Example two.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I made a promise that I would not smoke anymore.

223
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Example three.

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Carl told me he would buy a new car.

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So now I think it's clear this whole idea of the future in the past.

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And well, we'll also be answering any questions on the site if you have any problems.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Right.

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's right.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So why don't we listen to the dialog one more time and then we'll come back and talk about this holiday, which is the International Workers Day.

232
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
All right, everyone, settle down.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's get started.

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This brings me to our topic for today.

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Cinco de Mayo.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No, that's that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
No.

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
May 1st is International Workers Day.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do we get a day off from school then?

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No, it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.

246
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, man.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work 10, 12 and 14 hours a day.

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Support for the eight hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders.

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Cool.

254
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes.

256
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But the happy ending came at a high price.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works factory, killing four and wounding many.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

259
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then what happened?

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
All right, so Erica, in Canada, do you celebrate this?

262
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We do, but not on May 1st.

263
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, really?

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
When is it?

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The first weekend in September.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, really?

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And why?

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Um, I am not 100% sure.

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think it's because we already have a long weekend in May, because on the 24th of May is Queen Victoria's birthday, so we have to celebrate that.

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, really?

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, we can't have two vacations in the same month.

272
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, wow.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, yeah, I mean, it's not productive, right?

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Exactly.

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What about in Ecuador?

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, we do.

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
On May 1st, it's a holiday.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And we actually have two holidays in May as well, because on the 24th, we actually celebrate the Battle of Pichincha, which is one of the decisive battles for the independence of Ecuador.

279
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So we don't mind having two holidays in the same month.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, it sounds like Ecuador has a better holiday schedule in Canada.

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, it is.

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So yeah, on May 1st, people take vacations, and our companies usually on May 1st will do something special for their employees.

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, that's kind of a nice gesture, isn't it?

284
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah, so it's like, it's Workers' Day, so they'll set up maybe a barbecue or a trip or something like that.

285
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So that's what usually happens on May 1st.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Great.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, what about in your country's listeners?

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you celebrate May Day?

289
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,000
May Day.

290
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
May 1st, right?

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And if you do, well, let us know.

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your questions and comments there as well.

293
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's right.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Well, thanks for downloading this lesson.

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And until next time, goodbye.
