00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:03,220
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,799
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,519
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,559
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,300
And today we're bringing you an advanced lesson for all of our advanced learners out there.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,039
That's right.

7
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:15,599
And in this lesson, we're visiting a history class.

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:23,280
Yes, we're going to be talking about a very interesting topic that's known around the world, which is International Workers' Day.

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,239
That's right.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,460
And we're going to learn a little bit about the history of the workers' movement in the United States.

11
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:30,920
Right.

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:36,939
But we're also going to be taking a look at some great words and, of course, a little bit more advanced or complicated structures.

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:37,700
That's right.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,039
So I guess without further ado, we can get started with the dialogue.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,340
All right, everyone, settle down.

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:55,479
Let's get started.

17
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:02,500
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,459
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,000
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,200
This brings me to our topic for today.

21
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,680
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,700
Cinco de Mayo.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,719
No, that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,900
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,459
No, May 1st is International Workers' Day.

26
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,299
Do we get a day off from school then?

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,760
No, it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the U.S., but in other countries it is.

28
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,819
Oh, man.

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,859
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work 10, 12, and 14 hours a day.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,180
Support for the eight-hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,620
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

32
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:09,479
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures.

33
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:14,080
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

34
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,159
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:18,900
Cool.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,259
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

37
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:21,819
Yes.

38
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,740
But the happy ending came at a high price.

39
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:33,360
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works factory, killing four and wounding many.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,219
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

41
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,680
And then what happened?

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,620
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

43
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,139
All right, so we were in a history class and we learned something new, something interesting, right?

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,939
Yeah, International Workers Day.

45
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:59,060
It's not celebrated in the US, but in many other countries it is.

46
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,840
Right, on May 1st, a lot of people have a day off, so that's always good.

47
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:03,360
Yes.

48
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:11,020
All right, so why don't we take a look at some of the words that we saw in this dialogue, which were maybe a little bit different or difficult in language takeaway.

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,939
Language takeaway.

50
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,360
All right, we're just going to look at five words here.

51
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,939
And the first one, we talked about the Genesis of the movement.

52
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,319
Right, Genesis.

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,219
Genesis.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,560
Okay, so many of you may know that Genesis is a book in the Bible, right?

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,259
That's right.

56
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,800
And that's where this word comes from.

57
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,180
It's the first book in the Bible.

58
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:33,780
So it's the beginning.

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,879
Or the origin.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Origin.

61
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,460
So that's a Genesis.

62
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,139
So the Genesis of our legal system, you would say.

63
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:42,680
Right, or the Genesis of this problem.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,479
So it's the origin.

65
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,879
Yeah, it's a little bit of a formal word, isn't it?

66
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:50,199
Yeah, I guess maybe you can say the origin or the beginning.

67
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,259
Yeah, but maybe in an academic setting you can talk about the Genesis.

68
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,560
Yes, very good.

69
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,240
All right, what do we have next?

70
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:04,539
Well, one of the reasons why the workers movement got started was because of the appalling working conditions.

71
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:05,599
Appalling.

72
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,319
Appalling.

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,000
If something is appalling...

74
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,740
Shockingly bad.

75
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:11,780
Very, very bad.

76
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:17,279
So now if something is appalling, like the working conditions were appalling, you would feel appalled.

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Exactly.

78
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm appalled at your behavior.

79
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,259
Okay, so it's almost like you are disgusted.

80
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,360
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,519
Very, very strong word.

82
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,560
Yeah, very strong.

83
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,420
Okay, so the working conditions were appalling and people were setting up this movement, right?

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,339
But what happened?

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,399
They met some hostility.

86
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:35,399
Hostility.

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,220
Hostility.

88
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,660
Hostility from the police, right?

89
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,160
That's right.

90
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,699
So what is hostility?

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,000
Hostility is the state of receiving an unfriendly reaction.

92
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,839
Okay.

93
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:49,959
They acted in a very unfriendly way and it also suggests a hint of violence even.

94
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:50,560
Yeah.

95
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:57,079
So if somebody is hostile, they can maybe be aggressive and maybe to a point violent.

96
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,240
That's right.

97
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,819
Okay, so a hostile person.

98
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,220
Yeah, or a hostile environment, a dangerous environment.

99
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,899
Okay, hostility, hostile.

100
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,420
Very good.

101
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:13,819
Now because of these appalling working conditions, the labor movement decided to take drastic measures.

102
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,160
Drastic measures.

103
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,579
Yeah, drastic measures.

104
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,480
This is a really wonderful phrase and I think it would help us to listen to a few examples of this phrase in use.

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,540
Example one.

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,379
The president was faced with some difficult decisions and was forced to take drastic measures to solve the crisis.

107
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:37,680
Example two.

108
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,459
The police took very drastic measures to control the protesters outside the government palace.

109
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,259
So we understand drastic measures as extreme actions or decisions, right?

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,199
Yeah, exactly.

111
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,240
I think there's a saying that says desperate times call for drastic measures.

112
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,759
No, desperate times call for desperate measures.

113
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,019
Uh-huh.

114
00:05:59,279 --> 00:05:59,420
Dang.

115
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,800
Well, okay, but it goes around there somewhere, right?

116
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,819
Something like that.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,980
So if you really have an emergency, you need to do something drastic.

118
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,899
You have to take drastic measures or you can even say take drastic action.

119
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,579
Okay, very good.

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,860
And what about our last word?

121
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:23,379
After the protests ended in violence, people started to get angry because of the brutality the police showed.

122
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,639
Okay, brutality.

123
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:25,600
Brutality.

124
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,879
So again, maybe brutality and hostility are maybe similar, right?

125
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,439
A little bit similar.

126
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:35,120
So brutality is the state of being harsh or very forceful.

127
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, so brutality.

128
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,339
Now, we also use the word brutal.

129
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,040
Right, so that means harsh or very forceful.

130
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,019
Now, sometimes we can use that word but not in a harsh or forceful way, right?

131
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,360
Yeah, and it's quite, yeah, I might say something like, oh my god, that test was brutal.

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,240
Uh-huh, it was brutal or...

133
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,019
So it was really hard or really difficult.

134
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,959
Right, so that's what you're saying with this word, that it's very hard or it was very intense.

135
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,680
Yeah, maybe one more example.

136
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,579
Okay, so for example, I can say, oh, I went for a run today and it was brutal.

137
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,620
I'm so tired.

138
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,779
So it was really difficult.

139
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:10,899
Yeah, brutal.

140
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,220
And Marco, is this something that's used by everyone?

141
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:21,240
That phrase, brutal, using in that context would be for younger people maybe, not really, you wouldn't really hear older people using it.

142
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,660
So it's a little bit slangy.

143
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,259
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:25,040
Okay, great, great.

145
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,259
So those are five interesting vocabulary words.

146
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,500
As Marco mentioned, we want to look at some more difficult structures now in Fluency Builder.

147
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:43,360
Okay, so we have some phrases that we saw in this dialogue and well, let's start with the first one.

148
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:51,699
Well, the teacher opens his discussion by talking about how an understanding of the legal system is an important aspect of being a good citizen.

149
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,899
Okay, an important aspect.

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,980
An important aspect.

151
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,060
So well, maybe we know the word important, right?

152
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,959
So what's an aspect?

153
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,660
A part of something, an important part of something.

154
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,959
Okay, so the teacher started with an important aspect of and then specified the idea or what part it belongs to.

155
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,000
Right, so it usually follows this form.

156
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:12,480
Noun is an important aspect of noun.

157
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:13,199
Okay.

158
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:19,319
So for example, quality control is an important aspect of keeping customers happy.

159
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,360
Okay, perfect.

160
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,439
A part of.

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,040
Very good.

162
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,019
So aspect sounds a little bit more formal or just a lot more intelligent, right?

163
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:26,920
Yeah, professional.

164
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,420
And actually this is a wonderful way of setting up your idea.

165
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,740
So the teacher said that it's an important aspect of understanding the legal system was understanding its origins or its genesis.

166
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,159
Yep.

167
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,139
And then she moved on and said that it's not enough to simply memorize laws.

168
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,100
That's right.

169
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,860
It's not enough to simply do something.

170
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,960
Okay, so the beginning of this sentence, it is not enough to simply something.

171
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,519
By starting a sentence like this, you are indicating that more is required, right?

172
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,960
So here, it's not enough to simply memorize the laws.

173
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,759
We're saying that most people just memorize the laws, but they need to go further.

174
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,840
And understand them.

175
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:05,480
Exactly.

176
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,100
Another example would be, it's not enough to simply pass your exams.

177
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,759
You must get good grades as well.

178
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:14,620
Right.

179
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,299
Or maybe in a business context, it's not enough to simply satisfy your customers.

180
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,840
You must impress them.

181
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:21,379
Okay.

182
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,200
Very good.

183
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,720
So that's a very good way of starting out this idea of more is required.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,259
That's right.

185
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,120
More is required.

186
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:28,639
All right.

187
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,299
All right.

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,259
Well, I want to move on to one final point here.

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,059
I found this sentence to be really, really interesting.

190
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:41,679
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

191
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,539
Okay.

192
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,679
So why is this interesting?

193
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,600
Well, I found that, you know, there's two verbs going on here.

194
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,340
They passed a resolution that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

195
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,379
So we've got two verb times going on here at the same time.

196
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,559
And I'm wondering about this one, would.

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:01,519
Okay.

198
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,879
So what's happening here?

199
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,759
Obviously, this happened in the past.

200
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,179
It's like about a hundred years ago, right?

201
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Right.

202
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,799
So the resolution was passed a hundred years ago.

203
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,399
Right.

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,419
So this is going on in the past.

205
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:12,740
Right.

206
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,059
But there was a future action that was going to happen in consequence of this.

207
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:17,519
Right.

208
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,279
So the resolution stated that eight hours would constitute.

209
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:26,659
So it's like the primary action was the passing of the resolution.

210
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,399
And the result is this sort of this event that happens in the past, but is a future event to the first primary event.

211
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,240
Does that make any sense at all?

212
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:38,460
So this is called the future in the past, right?

213
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:38,820
That's right.

214
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,440
Okay.

215
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,179
So it's a it's a grammar structure.

216
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:47,620
Many of you maybe know the simple present or the or the future tenses, but this is a little strange one.

217
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,600
And as we said, so maybe it's a little bit difficult to understand the grammar in general.

218
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,500
So why don't we take a look at some more examples of how we would use this future in the past?

219
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,600
Example one.

220
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,100
The president said that he would cut taxes by five percent.

221
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:08,659
Example two.

222
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,220
I made a promise that I would not smoke anymore.

223
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,720
Example three.

224
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,179
Carl told me he would buy a new car.

225
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:27,779
Okay.

226
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,759
So now I think it's clear this whole idea of the future in the past.

227
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,659
And well, we'll also be answering any questions on the site if you have any problems.

228
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:34,919
Right.

229
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:35,519
That's right.

230
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,139
Okay.

231
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:42,120
So why don't we listen to the dialog one more time and then we'll come back and talk about this holiday, which is the International Workers Day.

232
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,279
All right, everyone, settle down.

233
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,399
Let's get started.

234
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:00,419
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

235
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,379
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

236
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,919
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

237
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,120
This brings me to our topic for today.

238
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,620
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

239
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,620
Cinco de Mayo.

240
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,639
No, that's that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

241
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,799
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,039
No.

243
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,360
May 1st is International Workers Day.

244
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,220
Do we get a day off from school then?

245
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,659
No, it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.

246
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,620
Oh, man.

247
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:46,840
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work 10, 12 and 14 hours a day.

248
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:54,120
Support for the eight hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders.

249
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:00,559
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

250
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,399
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures.

251
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,980
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

252
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,120
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

253
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,820
Cool.

254
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

255
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:19,820
Yes.

256
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:22,639
But the happy ending came at a high price.

257
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:31,259
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works factory, killing four and wounding many.

258
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,139
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

259
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,620
And then what happened?

260
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,580
Well, as we say, the rest is history.

261
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:47,700
All right, so Erica, in Canada, do you celebrate this?

262
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,700
We do, but not on May 1st.

263
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh, really?

264
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,379
When is it?

265
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,720
The first weekend in September.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,299
Oh, really?

267
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:52,620
And why?

268
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,279
Um, I am not 100% sure.

269
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:05,740
I think it's because we already have a long weekend in May, because on the 24th of May is Queen Victoria's birthday, so we have to celebrate that.

270
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,019
Oh, really?

271
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,639
Yeah, we can't have two vacations in the same month.

272
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:09,320
Oh, wow.

273
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,820
Well, yeah, I mean, it's not productive, right?

274
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:12,460
Exactly.

275
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:13,379
What about in Ecuador?

276
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,360
Yeah, we do.

277
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:16,379
On May 1st, it's a holiday.

278
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:26,539
And we actually have two holidays in May as well, because on the 24th, we actually celebrate the Battle of Pichincha, which is one of the decisive battles for the independence of Ecuador.

279
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:29,779
So we don't mind having two holidays in the same month.

280
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,120
Well, it sounds like Ecuador has a better holiday schedule in Canada.

281
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,120
Yeah, it is.

282
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,159
So yeah, on May 1st, people take vacations, and our companies usually on May 1st will do something special for their employees.

283
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,759
Oh, that's kind of a nice gesture, isn't it?

284
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,820
Yeah, so it's like, it's Workers' Day, so they'll set up maybe a barbecue or a trip or something like that.

285
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,000
So that's what usually happens on May 1st.

286
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:50,360
Great.

287
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,179
Well, what about in your country's listeners?

288
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,799
Do you celebrate May Day?

289
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:56,559
May Day.

290
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,980
May 1st, right?

291
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,399
And if you do, well, let us know.

292
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,039
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your questions and comments there as well.

293
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:04,820
That's right.

294
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,440
Well, thanks for downloading this lesson.

295
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,480
And until next time, goodbye.
