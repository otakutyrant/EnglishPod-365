1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All right, everyone, settle down.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's get started.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not enough to simply memorize our laws.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This brings me to our topic for today.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Does anyone know what we celebrate on May 1st?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cinco de Mayo?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No, that's May 5th in Spanish, James.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No wonder you're failing my Spanish class.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, May 1st is International Workers' Day.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do we get a day off from school then?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No, it is not considered to be a national holiday here in the U.S., but in other countries it is.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, man.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the 19th century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work 10, 12, and 14 hours a day.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Support for the 8-hour workday movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day's work.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And on May 1st, 1886, the resolution took effect.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Cool.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is that why we only work eight hours now?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes, but the happy ending came at a high price.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
On May 3rd, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And then what happened?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, as we say, the rest is history.
