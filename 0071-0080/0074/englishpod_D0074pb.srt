00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson and something that we all do.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Talking to ourselves.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Talking to ourselves, right?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I think everyone does it.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You think to yourself or you talk to yourself.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we're going to be doing that today, but we're going to be looking at some specific vocabulary.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Erika, why don't you tell us about that?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, unfortunately, we're going to be following a guy as he's in a really embarrassing situation.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we're going to hear him call himself some bad names in his mind.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So he's a little bit nervous and he thinks he is not very smart, right?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
OK, so before we start with this dialogue, there are a couple of words that we should look at in vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All right, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And the first one is famished.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Famished.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Famished.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
OK, so famished is an adjective.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Meaning very, very, very hungry.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Very, very hungry.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
OK, so just very hungry.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Very easy.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Famished.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, what about our next one?

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sexist.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sexist.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sexist.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Another adjective to describe a person, right?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Right.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Or a thing, I guess.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Like, yeah, an idea.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
OK, so a sexist person would be?

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Somebody who judges people by their sex.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So like all women are stupid, for example.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Which is not true, of course.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, of course not.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right, so sexist works both ways.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A woman can be sexist, a man could be sexist.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Exactly.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Meaning the woman thinks all men are stupid.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Which is also not true.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, let's just be clear about that.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All right, so now that we've taken a look at these two phrases, let's start with our dialogue and we'll be back to talk about all the great words.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Miss, your salad.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Looks good.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm positively famished.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And for you, sir.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Enjoy.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm so lucky.

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want to scream at the top of my lungs.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm the luckiest dude in the world.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, shut up.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't be such a dumbass.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
She's so hot.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wait, I can't say that.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's sexist.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She's so hot.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She's making me sexist.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, my God.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm such a tool.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
OK, get it together.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, she's eating salad.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, right.

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have a salad.

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, crap.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Which fork do I use?

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Damn it.

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She's going to think I'm a moron.

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What the hell are all these forks for?

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Which one did she use?

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
OK, chill.

82
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Be cool.

83
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Be cool.

84
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Just take a fork.

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Eat your salad.

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Um.

87
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sorry, what were you saying?

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're eating my salad.

89
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, yes, it's delicious.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
OK, embarrassing first date, huh?

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah.

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I mean, I really do feel sorry for this guy.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, it happens to us sometimes.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We are in the company of a very beautiful girl and we just get really nervous.

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right.

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, I mean, psychologists call this negative self-talk.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Really?

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This sort of calling yourself names and talking negatively about yourself.

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But actually, you can use some of this language to talk negatively about others.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So why don't we look now at this language in language takeaway?

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Language takeaway.

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So in language takeaway today, we have five words.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's start with our first one.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Dumbass, dumbass, dumbass.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OK, now this isn't a very polite word.

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Definitely not polite.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
OK, but what is a dumbass?

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, it's obviously a dumb, stupid idiot.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OK, so it's a person that is not very intelligent.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And our next word is also quite similar.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Moron, moron, moron, a moron.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If a person is a dumbass or a person is a moron, what's the difference?

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, basically, a moron is someone who is not smart, who is very unintelligent.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
OK, so they don't know what one plus one is.

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
OK.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But a dumbass is a person who does stupid things.

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OK, so maybe a dumbass, like you're planning a bank robbery and the dumbass forgets to bring the gun.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
OK, that is a dumbass.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
All right.

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So maybe moron is a little bit less offensive and it's actually you'll find it in the dictionary, right?

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Whereas a dumbass, I don't think you'll find it.

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, it's slang.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's slang.

126
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Exactly.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now, what about this next?

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's also a negative name.

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can call people a tool tool tool.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is very strange because I don't know how a tool can be something negative.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Towards a person.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah.

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But it actually means the opposite, right?

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If a person is called a tool, it means they are useless.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Useless.

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So if you ever call the tool, they're saying that you're useless.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're good for nothing.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All right.

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, these are three interesting words.

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So why don't we hear some examples of each of these words in use.

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Example one.

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I hate Tom.

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He's such a dumbass.

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Last week, he borrowed my mobile phone and dropped it in the pool.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Example two.

149
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't like Kevin very much.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He can be a real moron at times.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Example three.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He was looking for a job, but he didn't even have a resume prepared.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's such a dumbass.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So great examples.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And here at EnglishPod, we're bringing you real street talk.

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Exactly.

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Language as it is spoken by today's youth.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now let's take a look at our last two words.

161
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All right.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, these phrases you can use when you're trying to calm yourself down and make yourself relax a little bit, right?

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Right.

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's take a look at the next one.

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Chill.

166
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Chill.

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Chill.

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Chill.

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So again, relax.

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Calm down.

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Calm down.

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yep.

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You need to chill.

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And then you also need to be cool.

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Be cool.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Be cool.

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now, if you can tell the pattern is related to temperature, right?

180
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Chill is cold.

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Cool is similar to cold.

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yep.

183
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So again, that's what it means to relax.

184
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
To calm down your emotions.

185
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right.

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Make your emotions not so hot.

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Exactly.

188
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
All right.

190
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So chill.

191
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Be cool.

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Exactly.

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And you use them together like that, don't you?

194
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yep.

196
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now chill also has another way of using it, right?

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Exactly.

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can say I'm chilling with my friends.

199
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah.

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We're chilling here in the EnglishPod studio.

201
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Which means we're just relaxing.

202
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We are just having fun.

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yep.

204
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Not doing anything, right?

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Exactly.

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But you can't say chilling.

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You have to drop the G.

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

209
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have to try.

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right.

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can't say I'm chilling.

212
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You have to say I'm chilling.

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm chilling.

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

215
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So that's all for language takeaway.

216
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But now let's take a look at some of the really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Fluency Builder.

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So this guy is so happy he's on this date that he wants to scream at the top of his lungs.

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Scream at the top of my lungs.

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Scream at the top of my lungs.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So basically he just wants to scream.

223
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
To shout really loudly.

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Really loudly.

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah.

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's so excited, right?

227
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Exactly.

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So for example, sometimes you're at a concert, right?

230
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yep.

231
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And you need to talk to your friend and you're like screaming at the top of your lungs because the other person can't hear you.

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Exactly.

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Or maybe you're lost in the woods and you need to scream at the top of your lungs so that someone will hear you and find you.

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right.

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Very good.

236
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So scream at the top of my lungs.

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Our next phrase.

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Get it together.

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Get it together.

241
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Get it together.

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So if I tell you, Erika, you need to get it together.

243
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Basically you're telling me to calm down, relax.

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So pull your emotions together, you know, get your ideas straight.

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Right.

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So it kind of gives you this idea that you got to pull, like you said, pull your emotions together in a little box and tie them up.

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right.

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So get it together.

249
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yep.

250
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So Marco, when would you use this phrase, get it together?

251
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I guess when somebody is either very emotional, maybe crying or very nervous, you know, you tell the person, oh, get it together, you know, relax.

252
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah.

253
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Or when somebody maybe is not doing something good in their life.

254
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah.

255
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know, like making bad decisions or not being responsible.

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You tell that person you need to get it together.

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Exactly.

258
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Right.

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Exactly.

260
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I couldn't have said it better myself.

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

262
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So now why don't we move on to our next phrase.

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And this is really, really high frequency.

264
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think I would hear it all the time.

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
All right.

266
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So what the hell, what the hell, what the hell?

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So why would you say what the hell?

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, obviously you're asking a question, right?

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Because you've got your, your w you got your what?

270
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But when you say the hell, you're putting emphasis on the what?

271
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So you're asking a really strong question, right?

272
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But it's not polite.

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not polite.

274
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah.

275
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

276
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So if I say what the hell is going on?

277
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's happening?

278
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Really, really what's happening, right?

279
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah.

280
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, and we can change it a little bit.

281
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We can replace the what with another wh like why, how, how, where, where or when?

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah.

283
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So why don't we hear some examples of how this expression is used using different wh words.

285
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Example one.

286
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where the hell are you?

287
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I've been waiting for hours.

288
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Example two.

289
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How the hell did you do that?

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That was amazing.

291
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Example three.

292
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When the hell are you going to find a job?

293
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm tired of pay for everything.

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Example four.

295
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Who the hell are you?

296
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know you.

297
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
All right.

298
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Now our final word, also a little bit strong, but pretty high frequency.

299
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh yeah, very high frequency.

300
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh crap.

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh crap.

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh crap.

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So it's a little bit strong, but less strong than maybe saying a really bad word, right?

304
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

305
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But it's definitely saying like you made a mistake, right?

306
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah.

307
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's like a really strong.

308
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh no.

309
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh no.

310
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Exactly.

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
A really strong.

312
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh no.

313
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah.

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But I guess not many people say, Oh no.

315
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh no.

316
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I just lost $10 million.

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Exactly.

318
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Right.

319
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You would not say that.

320
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

321
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So it's a very strong.

322
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh no.

323
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But it's not as strong as it could be.

324
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There are other words out there that are stronger, but we are not going to go into them here, but maybe you guys know.

325
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So let us know who can definitely keep an eye out on the comment section, but don't write the words in the comment section.

326
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

327
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So we saw some really great phrases, some really great words, a lot of informal language, but it's very high frequency and you'll use that with your friends or you'll see it in movies, TV shows.

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

329
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Really common in movies and TV shows.

330
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Exactly.

331
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So let's listen to this dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk a bit more.

332
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Miss your salad.

333
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hmm.

334
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Looks good.

335
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm positively famished.

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And for you, sir.

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you.

338
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Enjoy.

339
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Thank you.

340
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

341
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm so lucky.

342
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

343
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to scream at the top of my lungs.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm the luckiest dude in the world.

345
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, shut up.

346
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Don't be such a dumb ass.

347
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
She's so hot.

348
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Wait.

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I can't say that.

350
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Good sexist.

351
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
She's so hot.

352
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
She's making me sexist.

353
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh my God.

354
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm such a tool.

355
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay.

356
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Get it together.

357
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
She's eating salad.

358
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, right.

359
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I have a salad.

360
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh crap.

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Which fork do I use?

362
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Damn it.

363
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He's going to think I'm a moron.

364
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What the hell are all these forks for?

365
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Which one did she use?

366
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

367
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Chill.

368
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Be cool.

369
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Be cool.

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Just take a fork.

371
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Eat your salad.

372
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Um, sorry.

373
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What were you saying?

374
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're eating my salad.

375
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Oh yes.

376
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's delicious.

377
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So these slang words, they're actually very common, right?

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I think like you said, it's not likely that you'll find them in a dictionary.

380
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Of course.

381
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You can find them in movies or sometimes when you're having a conversation and very informal conversation with a native speaker, these words will slip out and these slang terms will come up.

382
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Exactly.

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And you know what?

384
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There's a great resource out there for wonderful English slang terms called urban dictionary.com.

385
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Exactly.

386
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you ever see a word that maybe you can find in the conventional dictionary, you're probably going to find it there.

387
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah.
