00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,519
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,240
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,280
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,060
Today we're bringing you an upper intermediate lesson and something that we all do.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,740
Right.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,119
Talking to ourselves.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
Talking to ourselves, right?

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,260
I think everyone does it.

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,420
You think to yourself or you talk to yourself.

11
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,699
And we're going to be doing that today, but we're going to be looking at some specific vocabulary.

12
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,160
Erika, why don't you tell us about that?

13
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,399
Well, unfortunately, we're going to be following a guy as he's in a really embarrassing situation.

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,200
And we're going to hear him call himself some bad names in his mind.

15
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:38,539
So he's a little bit nervous and he thinks he is not very smart, right?

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:39,420
That's right.

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,759
OK, so before we start with this dialogue, there are a couple of words that we should look at in vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:47,619
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,640
All right, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

20
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,719
And the first one is famished.

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:53,880
Famished.

22
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,759
Famished.

23
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,960
OK, so famished is an adjective.

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,700
That's right.

25
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,799
Meaning very, very, very hungry.

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,179
Very, very hungry.

27
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,019
OK, so just very hungry.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:04,620
Very easy.

29
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,099
Famished.

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,140
Now, what about our next one?

31
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:08,379
Sexist.

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,400
Sexist.

33
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:10,299
Sexist.

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,140
Another adjective to describe a person, right?

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,599
Right.

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,099
Or a thing, I guess.

37
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,060
Like, yeah, an idea.

38
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,540
OK, so a sexist person would be?

39
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,239
Somebody who judges people by their sex.

40
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,260
So like all women are stupid, for example.

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,000
Which is not true, of course.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,060
No, of course not.

43
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,780
Right, so sexist works both ways.

44
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,420
A woman can be sexist, a man could be sexist.

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:33,980
Exactly.

46
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,219
Meaning the woman thinks all men are stupid.

47
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,680
Which is also not true.

48
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,719
Yes, let's just be clear about that.

49
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,379
All right, so now that we've taken a look at these two phrases, let's start with our dialogue and we'll be back to talk about all the great words.

50
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,739
Miss, your salad.

51
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,319
Looks good.

52
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm positively famished.

53
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
And for you, sir.

54
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,560
Thank you.

55
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,780
Enjoy.

56
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,300
Thank you.

57
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,520
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

58
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm so lucky.

59
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:18,439
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

60
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,919
I want to scream at the top of my lungs.

61
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,979
I'm the luckiest dude in the world.

62
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,659
Oh, shut up.

63
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,039
Don't be such a dumbass.

64
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,020
She's so hot.

65
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,439
Wait, I can't say that.

66
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:29,740
That's sexist.

67
00:02:30,699 --> 00:02:31,340
She's so hot.

68
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:32,460
She's making me sexist.

69
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,460
Oh, my God.

70
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:34,719
I'm such a tool.

71
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:36,080
OK, get it together.

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,020
Oh, she's eating salad.

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,060
Oh, right.

74
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,080
I have a salad.

75
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:41,860
Oh, crap.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,759
Which fork do I use?

77
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,620
Damn it.

78
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,580
She's going to think I'm a moron.

79
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,340
What the hell are all these forks for?

80
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,000
Which one did she use?

81
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:49,919
OK, chill.

82
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,960
Be cool.

83
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:51,500
Be cool.

84
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,000
Just take a fork.

85
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,080
Eat your salad.

86
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,259
Um.

87
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,419
Sorry, what were you saying?

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,219
You're eating my salad.

89
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,860
Oh, yes, it's delicious.

90
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:25,439
OK, embarrassing first date, huh?

91
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,039
Yeah.

92
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,460
I mean, I really do feel sorry for this guy.

93
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,139
Well, it happens to us sometimes.

94
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,780
We are in the company of a very beautiful girl and we just get really nervous.

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:34,719
All right.

96
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,960
Well, I mean, psychologists call this negative self-talk.

97
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:39,740
Really?

98
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:40,139
Yeah.

99
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,379
This sort of calling yourself names and talking negatively about yourself.

100
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,719
But actually, you can use some of this language to talk negatively about others.

101
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,280
So why don't we look now at this language in language takeaway?

102
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,159
Language takeaway.

103
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,560
So in language takeaway today, we have five words.

104
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,960
Let's start with our first one.

105
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:02,780
Dumbass, dumbass, dumbass.

106
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:06,219
OK, now this isn't a very polite word.

107
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,560
Definitely not polite.

108
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,979
OK, but what is a dumbass?

109
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,099
Well, it's obviously a dumb, stupid idiot.

110
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,620
OK, so it's a person that is not very intelligent.

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
And our next word is also quite similar.

112
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,720
Moron, moron, moron, a moron.

113
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,000
If a person is a dumbass or a person is a moron, what's the difference?

114
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,399
Well, basically, a moron is someone who is not smart, who is very unintelligent.

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,379
OK, so they don't know what one plus one is.

116
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:41,740
OK.

117
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:42,139
All right.

118
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,560
But a dumbass is a person who does stupid things.

119
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:50,300
OK, so maybe a dumbass, like you're planning a bank robbery and the dumbass forgets to bring the gun.

120
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,060
OK, that is a dumbass.

121
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,639
All right.

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,600
So maybe moron is a little bit less offensive and it's actually you'll find it in the dictionary, right?

123
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,459
Whereas a dumbass, I don't think you'll find it.

124
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,079
Yeah, it's slang.

125
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:01,720
It's slang.

126
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,240
Exactly.

127
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:03,600
Now, what about this next?

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,819
It's also a negative name.

129
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,019
You can call people a tool tool tool.

130
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,740
This is very strange because I don't know how a tool can be something negative.

131
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:13,139
Yeah.

132
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,100
Towards a person.

133
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:14,459
Yeah.

134
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,399
But it actually means the opposite, right?

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,480
If a person is called a tool, it means they are useless.

136
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:19,980
Useless.

137
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,339
Right.

138
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,660
Yeah.

139
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,399
So if you ever call the tool, they're saying that you're useless.

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,959
You're good for nothing.

141
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:26,399
All right.

142
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,959
Well, these are three interesting words.

143
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,279
So why don't we hear some examples of each of these words in use.

144
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,339
Example one.

145
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,319
I hate Tom.

146
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,300
He's such a dumbass.

147
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,180
Last week, he borrowed my mobile phone and dropped it in the pool.

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,420
Example two.

149
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,740
I don't like Kevin very much.

150
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,680
He can be a real moron at times.

151
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,339
Example three.

152
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,199
He was looking for a job, but he didn't even have a resume prepared.

153
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,220
He's such a dumbass.

154
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,220
Okay.

155
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,759
So great examples.

156
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,920
And here at EnglishPod, we're bringing you real street talk.

157
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Exactly.

158
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,379
Language as it is spoken by today's youth.

159
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,139
Okay.

160
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,800
Now let's take a look at our last two words.

161
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,240
All right.

162
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Well, these phrases you can use when you're trying to calm yourself down and make yourself relax a little bit, right?

163
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:22,879
Right.

164
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,199
Let's take a look at the next one.

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,819
Chill.

166
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:25,600
Chill.

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,259
Okay.

168
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:26,920
Chill.

169
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:27,459
Chill.

170
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,660
So again, relax.

171
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,959
Calm down.

172
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,459
Calm down.

173
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:31,740
Yep.

174
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,079
You need to chill.

175
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:33,639
Yes.

176
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,240
And then you also need to be cool.

177
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,319
Be cool.

178
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,920
Be cool.

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,839
Now, if you can tell the pattern is related to temperature, right?

180
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,860
Chill is cold.

181
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Cool is similar to cold.

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:44,779
Yep.

183
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,439
So again, that's what it means to relax.

184
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,980
To calm down your emotions.

185
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,420
Right.

186
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,779
Make your emotions not so hot.

187
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,360
Exactly.

188
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:51,899
Yeah.

189
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,399
All right.

190
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:53,300
So chill.

191
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:53,860
Be cool.

192
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:54,459
Exactly.

193
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,240
And you use them together like that, don't you?

194
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:56,600
Yeah.

195
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,040
Yep.

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,060
Now chill also has another way of using it, right?

197
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,459
Exactly.

198
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,579
You can say I'm chilling with my friends.

199
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:02,839
Yeah.

200
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:04,579
We're chilling here in the EnglishPod studio.

201
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,779
Which means we're just relaxing.

202
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,579
We are just having fun.

203
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:08,839
Yep.

204
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:09,939
Not doing anything, right?

205
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:10,300
Exactly.

206
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,040
But you can't say chilling.

207
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,360
You have to drop the G.

208
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:14,959
Yeah.

209
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,560
You have to try.

210
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,579
Right.

211
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,620
You can't say I'm chilling.

212
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,899
You have to say I'm chilling.

213
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:19,579
I'm chilling.

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,079
Okay.

215
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,019
So that's all for language takeaway.

216
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:28,879
But now let's take a look at some of the really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

217
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:31,439
Fluency Builder.

218
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Okay.

219
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,699
So this guy is so happy he's on this date that he wants to scream at the top of his lungs.

220
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,639
Scream at the top of my lungs.

221
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,060
Scream at the top of my lungs.

222
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:45,300
So basically he just wants to scream.

223
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,040
To shout really loudly.

224
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:47,959
Really loudly.

225
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,259
Yeah.

226
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,500
He's so excited, right?

227
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:49,980
Exactly.

228
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,620
Okay.

229
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,379
So for example, sometimes you're at a concert, right?

230
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:53,620
Yep.

231
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,759
And you need to talk to your friend and you're like screaming at the top of your lungs because the other person can't hear you.

232
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,360
Exactly.

233
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,660
Or maybe you're lost in the woods and you need to scream at the top of your lungs so that someone will hear you and find you.

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,240
All right.

235
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:06,860
Very good.

236
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,720
Okay.

237
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,800
So scream at the top of my lungs.

238
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,899
Our next phrase.

239
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,800
Get it together.

240
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,920
Get it together.

241
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,720
Get it together.

242
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,660
So if I tell you, Erika, you need to get it together.

243
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,860
Basically you're telling me to calm down, relax.

244
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,399
So pull your emotions together, you know, get your ideas straight.

245
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Right.

246
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:33,220
So it kind of gives you this idea that you got to pull, like you said, pull your emotions together in a little box and tie them up.

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,240
All right.

248
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,220
So get it together.

249
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:35,620
Yep.

250
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,799
So Marco, when would you use this phrase, get it together?

251
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:46,799
I guess when somebody is either very emotional, maybe crying or very nervous, you know, you tell the person, oh, get it together, you know, relax.

252
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:47,259
Yeah.

253
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:51,100
Or when somebody maybe is not doing something good in their life.

254
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:51,460
Yeah.

255
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
You know, like making bad decisions or not being responsible.

256
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,639
You tell that person you need to get it together.

257
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,179
Exactly.

258
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:57,940
Right.

259
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:58,940
Exactly.

260
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:00,159
I couldn't have said it better myself.

261
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,419
Okay.

262
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,620
So now why don't we move on to our next phrase.

263
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,840
And this is really, really high frequency.

264
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,299
I think I would hear it all the time.

265
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,059
All right.

266
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,960
So what the hell, what the hell, what the hell?

267
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,980
So why would you say what the hell?

268
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,259
Well, obviously you're asking a question, right?

269
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,919
Because you've got your, your w you got your what?

270
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,299
But when you say the hell, you're putting emphasis on the what?

271
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,539
So you're asking a really strong question, right?

272
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,460
But it's not polite.

273
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,299
It's not polite.

274
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:27,580
Yeah.

275
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,100
Okay.

276
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,320
So if I say what the hell is going on?

277
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,580
What's happening?

278
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,279
Really, really what's happening, right?

279
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:33,679
Yeah.

280
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,840
So, and we can change it a little bit.

281
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:43,019
We can replace the what with another wh like why, how, how, where, where or when?

282
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,279
Yeah.

283
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:43,980
Okay.

284
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,500
So why don't we hear some examples of how this expression is used using different wh words.

285
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,039
Example one.

286
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,879
Where the hell are you?

287
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,460
I've been waiting for hours.

288
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,879
Example two.

289
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,759
How the hell did you do that?

290
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:10,980
That was amazing.

291
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,500
Example three.

292
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,299
When the hell are you going to find a job?

293
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm tired of pay for everything.

294
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,879
Example four.

295
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,620
Who the hell are you?

296
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,799
I don't know you.

297
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:36,820
All right.

298
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,899
Now our final word, also a little bit strong, but pretty high frequency.

299
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,379
Oh yeah, very high frequency.

300
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:45,799
Oh crap.

301
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:46,539
Oh crap.

302
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,159
Oh crap.

303
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,299
So it's a little bit strong, but less strong than maybe saying a really bad word, right?

304
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:53,600
Yes.

305
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,299
But it's definitely saying like you made a mistake, right?

306
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:57,519
Yeah.

307
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,779
It's like a really strong.

308
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh no.

309
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,019
Oh no.

310
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:00,500
Exactly.

311
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,240
A really strong.

312
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:01,700
Oh no.

313
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:02,039
Yeah.

314
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,960
But I guess not many people say, Oh no.

315
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,740
Oh no.

316
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,220
I just lost $10 million.

317
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,399
Exactly.

318
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:08,700
Right.

319
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,720
You would not say that.

320
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:09,980
Yeah.

321
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,240
So it's a very strong.

322
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:11,659
Oh no.

323
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,559
But it's not as strong as it could be.

324
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,120
There are other words out there that are stronger, but we are not going to go into them here, but maybe you guys know.

325
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:25,139
So let us know who can definitely keep an eye out on the comment section, but don't write the words in the comment section.

326
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,259
Okay.

327
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:36,820
So we saw some really great phrases, some really great words, a lot of informal language, but it's very high frequency and you'll use that with your friends or you'll see it in movies, TV shows.

328
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:37,179
Yeah.

329
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,960
Really common in movies and TV shows.

330
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:39,519
Exactly.

331
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:44,720
So let's listen to this dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk a bit more.

332
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,179
Miss your salad.

333
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:54,899
Hmm.

334
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:55,720
Looks good.

335
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,379
I'm positively famished.

336
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,100
And for you, sir.

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,820
Thank you.

338
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,200
Enjoy.

339
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,679
Thank you.

340
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,899
I can't believe she's on a date with me.

341
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,639
I'm so lucky.

342
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,840
I must be the luckiest guy in the world.

343
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,320
I want to scream at the top of my lungs.

344
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,340
I'm the luckiest dude in the world.

345
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,059
Oh, shut up.

346
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:19,440
Don't be such a dumb ass.

347
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:21,399
She's so hot.

348
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,080
Wait.

349
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:22,759
I can't say that.

350
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,100
Good sexist.

351
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,700
She's so hot.

352
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,860
She's making me sexist.

353
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:27,860
Oh my God.

354
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm such a tool.

355
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:29,860
Okay.

356
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,460
Get it together.

357
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:32,399
She's eating salad.

358
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh, right.

359
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,480
I have a salad.

360
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:36,240
Oh crap.

361
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,159
Which fork do I use?

362
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,039
Damn it.

363
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,960
He's going to think I'm a moron.

364
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
What the hell are all these forks for?

365
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,379
Which one did she use?

366
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,059
Okay.

367
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:44,299
Chill.

368
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:45,340
Be cool.

369
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:45,940
Be cool.

370
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,360
Just take a fork.

371
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,419
Eat your salad.

372
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,779
Um, sorry.

373
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:57,820
What were you saying?

374
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,639
You're eating my salad.

375
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,159
Oh yes.

376
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,340
It's delicious.

377
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,100
So these slang words, they're actually very common, right?

378
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,440
Yeah.

379
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,879
I think like you said, it's not likely that you'll find them in a dictionary.

380
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:22,679
Of course.

381
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:31,539
You can find them in movies or sometimes when you're having a conversation and very informal conversation with a native speaker, these words will slip out and these slang terms will come up.

382
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,159
Exactly.

383
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,740
And you know what?

384
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:39,500
There's a great resource out there for wonderful English slang terms called urban dictionary.com.

385
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,080
Exactly.

386
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,700
If you ever see a word that maybe you can find in the conventional dictionary, you're probably going to find it there.

387
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:45,980
Yeah.
