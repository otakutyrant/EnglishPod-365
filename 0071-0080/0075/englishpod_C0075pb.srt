00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be going to one of the least favorite places of many many people.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So it must be the dentist.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly, that place where you have to go every six months, but...

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You probably don't go.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You probably don't.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I know I don't go every six months.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So yeah, we're going to be going to the dentist, and of course we're going to be looking at a lot of great vocabulary related to teeth and all that crazy stuff dentists do.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, and we'll also learn some really interesting phrases.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So Marco, let's get started with our vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Vocabulary preview.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, in vocabulary preview today we have two words.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's take a look at the first one.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Toothache.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Toothache.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Toothache.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Toothache.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, so we've seen before this ending ache, right?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It means it hurts.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So again, a toothache would be...

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
A hurting tooth.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A hurting tooth.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We can also say stomach ache.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Headache.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yep.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Pretty much everything.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ache.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ache.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So our next word.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
X-ray.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
X-ray.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
X-ray.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
X hyphen R-A-Y.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, pretty easy word.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So when you go to the doctor, many times you'll get an x-ray.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It is a picture of your bones.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So that's an x-ray.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, well we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue, so why don't we listen as Gary visits his dentist.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, Gary.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Great to see you again.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Please have a seat.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So tell me what seems to be the problem.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thanks, doc.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've got a really bad toothache.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can't eat anything, and look, my face is all swollen.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, let's have a look.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Open wide.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This doesn't look good.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm going to order some x-rays.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Is it going to hurt?

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, not at all.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Just lay back and relax.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, spit.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, that always happens.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The dentist says, no, it's not going to hurt.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Don't worry about it.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But it always hurts much more than he says.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So in this dialogue, we saw some interesting words when the dentist was describing what problems Gary had.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So why don't we look at those now in Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right, let's take a look at our first word.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So Gary said that his face was all swollen.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Swollen.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Swollen.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Swollen.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So swollen is an adjective, right Marco?

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So his face is, or was, swollen.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It was bigger.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, his face was bigger than normal.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Often when you hurt yourself, that part of your body becomes swollen.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Swollen, right.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So you have to put some ice on it usually, and then the swelling will go down.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And that's the noun, the swelling.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The swelling.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And, well, the verb to swell.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right, three words for the price of one.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So let's listen to some examples of how we would use the swelling, swollen, and to swell.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Example one.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My nose is swollen.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's the size of a football.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Example two.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Put some ice on your foot, and the swelling will go down.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Example three.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I got bitten by a spider, and my hand is swelling up.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
All right, so Gary's face was swollen, and he thought that it was his wisdom teeth.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Wisdom teeth.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Wisdom teeth.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, so this is interesting.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wisdom is like wise.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, knowledge.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Knowledge.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So these teeth, they're not knowledgeable, but they're called wisdom teeth.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They're the teeth that grow last in your mouth, right?

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right, they are the last teeth at the very end of your mouth.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, and usually you get them when you're about 20.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And since they come out at this age, sometimes they interfere or they hurt a little bit, so you have to get them taken out.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All right, wisdom teeth.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wisdom teeth.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, now for our next word, and something that we all got as children.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Cavity.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Cavity.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A cavity.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A cavity.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's a hole in your tooth.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A hole in your tooth.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And it's caused by?

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Too much sugar.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Too much sugar, right?

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Or not brushing your teeth enough.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So that's why everyone had it, I think, as children.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Cavities.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I never had a cavity.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Really?

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wow, didn't have much sugar?

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I guess I was a bit of a health nut when I was a kid.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, no, I wasn't.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
My mom was.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, I guess not.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right, but enough about my eating habits.

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's talk about our next word, crown.

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Crown.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
A crown.

142
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, a crown.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is interesting.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We're not talking kings and queens.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right, that's the first thing that comes to mind, right?

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No, a crown is actually the visible part of your teeth.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, so there's one part of your tooth that's inside that you can't see, right?

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Right, that's called the root.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So, when he said your crown is loose, what's he talking really about the actual tooth?

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So, sometimes people will lose a tooth or have a really bad cavity, so the dentist needs to make a new crown or a new visible part of the tooth for you.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, sometimes it'll be made of gold.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yep.

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Or porcelain.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Porcelain, exactly.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, a crown, it's like a really, really, really big filling.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A crown.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So, his crown needed to be refitted or put back into place.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now, our final word, a filling.

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Filling.

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A filling.

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A filling.

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So, I just said this word previously.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now, when you have a cavity, you need to fill it in.

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Right, you need to fill it with something.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's usually some sort of paste.

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And it gets really hard, just like your tooth.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Exactly.

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So, then it covers up this cavity.

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Filling.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A filling.

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I have many fillings.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I wasn't very healthy as a kid.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Alright, not a good toothbrusher.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Exactly.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So, why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit about some of the interesting phrases that the doctor used.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, tell me what seems to be the problem.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Thanks, doc.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I've got a really bad toothache.

182
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can't eat anything.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And look, my face is all swollen.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, let's have a look.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Open wide.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hmm, this doesn't look good.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, it looks like you have a cavity, and your crown is loose.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And the crown probably needs to be refitted.

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to order some x-rays.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is it going to hurt?

193
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, not at all.

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Just lay back and relax.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, spit.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, the dentist used three really interesting phrases, and I want to look at the first one.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What seems to be the problem?

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What seems to be the problem?

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What seems to be the problem?

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Very easy.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A little sentence to ask somebody what's wrong.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Exactly.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Right?

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And, I mean, these are small, easy words, but when you put them together, they sound really natural and really fluent.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So if you ask somebody what seems to be the problem, it's very polite, and it's a very good way of asking what's wrong.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right.

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Our next phrase, also made up of simple words.

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's have a look.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's have a look.

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's have a look.

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So this is a phrase that maybe your mechanic or your dentist or your doctor will say.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Or anyone.

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Right.

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's have a look.

217
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's look at it and see what the problem is.

218
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's have a look.

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And our final phrase, it doesn't look good.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It doesn't look good.

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It doesn't look good.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I can use this phrase for an object, right?

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Like, this house doesn't look good.

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But here it's used a little bit differently.

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So why don't we listen to some examples to help us understand the meaning?

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Example one.

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
John told me it doesn't look good for me.

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I probably won't get the job.

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Example two.

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It doesn't look good for Michael Jackson.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's in a lot of debt.

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Example three.

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know, the economy doesn't look very good.

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So in the examples, we can see that they are using it for the situation.

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah.

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It looks maybe problematic.

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah.

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So when you say it doesn't look good, you basically mean there are going to be problems.

243
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
All right.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It doesn't look good.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah.

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So great phrases.

248
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Great words.

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's listen to our Gary at the Dentist one more time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hey, Gary.

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Great to see you again.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Please have a seat.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So tell me what seems to be the problem.

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thanks, doc.

255
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've got a really bad toothache.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I can't eat anything.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And look, my face is all swollen.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, let's have a look.

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Open wide.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This doesn't look good.

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, it looks like you have a cavity, and your crown is loose.

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted.

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm going to order some x-rays.

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Is it going to hurt?

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No, not at all.

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just lay back and relax.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay, spit.

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, Marco, speaking of dentists, have you ever had an experience like this where you've spat out a tooth at the dentist?

270
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, nothing so serious as this, but actually recently when I was in Cambodia.

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, right, you called us in Cambodia.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Well, our taxi driver offered us to have some local food, and he said, well, we're going to have a dog.

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So that was interesting.

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It was pretty good, but if you get around the fact that it's a dog.

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So what does this have to do with your teeth?

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was eating it, and I bit a bone that was hidden, and I chipped my tooth.

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So you broke part of your tooth?

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yeah, like half of it, which I had already chipped before.

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So I had to go to the dentist, and so the dentist created a new crown, not with gold or porcelain, actually with a paste.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh.

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And then it becomes hard, and it just looks normal.

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It doesn't even look like I have a fake crown, so to say.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But dentists can be really expensive, so how much did this cost?

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, this was for the bargain price of $10.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
$10.

287
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
$10.

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's how much it cost.

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So we should all go to Cambodia for dentistry.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, because actually it was pretty good.

291
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He looked really young though.

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I was kind of scared because when he walked in, he looked like he was 19, but I asked him his age, and he was like 30.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Okay, well you're very trusting.

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah, so I imagine that you guys maybe have some dental experiences, so why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it.

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah, visit us at EnglishPod.com, and you can find lots more resources for learning English there.

296
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well guys, thanks for listening, and until next time, bye.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Bye.
