EnglishPod.com Hey, Gary.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Great to see you again.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please, have a seat.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, tell me what seems to be the problem.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thanks, Doc.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've got a really bad toothache.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't eat anything, and look, my face is all swollen.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, let's have a look.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Open wide.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This doesn't look good.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to order some x-rays.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is it going to hurt?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No, not at all.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Just lay back and relax.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay, spit.
