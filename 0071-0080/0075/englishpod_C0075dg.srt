EnglishPod.com Hey, Gary.

2
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:14,539
Great to see you again.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,940
Please, have a seat.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,920
So, tell me what seems to be the problem.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,199
Thanks, Doc.

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,019
I've got a really bad toothache.

7
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,219
I can't eat anything, and look, my face is all swollen.

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,879
I think it might be my wisdom teeth.

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,880
Well, let's have a look.

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,140
Open wide.

11
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,500
This doesn't look good.

12
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,560
Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:03,759
We'll need to put in a filling before it gets any worse, and the crown probably needs to be refitted.

14
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,579
I'm going to order some x-rays.

15
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,840
Is it going to hurt?

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,799
No, not at all.

17
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,400
Just lay back and relax.

18
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,980
Okay, spit.
