Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,259
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,019
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:08,539
And today we're bringing you a great office lesson.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,919
That's right, but actually I hope this situation never happens to any of our listeners.

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,119
Exactly.

8
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,879
Today we are firing somebody.

9
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:17,739
Yikes.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,100
It is a little bit complicated, but maybe you're an HR manager, maybe you are a supervisor, and you'll have to do this one day.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,780
So, gotta learn how, right?

12
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,339
Exactly.

13
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:32,600
Alright, well why don't we get started then, as we listen to Isabelle and Anthony.

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,140
Hi Isabelle.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,259
You wanted to see me?

16
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,380
Yes, Anthony.

17
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:51,399
Come on in and have a seat.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,320
Is everything okay?

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,320
You seem a bit preoccupied.

20
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:02,179
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

21
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,299
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

22
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:08,319
Okay.

23
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,620
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just gonna come out with it.

24
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:14,379
We're gonna have to let you go.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,659
What?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,420
Why?

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,239
I mean, just like that, I'm fired?

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

29
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:24,519
What?

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,739
I resent that.

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,219
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

32
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,439
You called in sick eight times this month, and you smell like alcohol.

33
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,239
He did sound a little bit like he had too much to drink.

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,900
I know, he had that kind of slur.

35
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,739
Yeah, that slow way of talking that made him seem a little bit drunk.

36
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,859
Well, that's definitely something you don't want to do is show up to work with alcohol in your breath.

37
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,500
Exactly, but you know what?

38
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,020
There's a lot of great language in this dialogue, so why don't we take a look at it now in language takeaway.

39
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,039
Language takeaway.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,979
All right, well, I want to look at three words here.

41
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,219
Now, the first one, Anthony said that Isabel was preoccupied.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,680
Preoccupied.

43
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,539
Preoccupied.

44
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:24,159
Okay, so if somebody is preoccupied.

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,419
They're not focused.

46
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:26,879
Maybe they're a little bit worried.

47
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,680
Yeah, they're thinking of something else.

48
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:29,099
Okay.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,199
Why don't we take a listen to a few examples of how this word is used.

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,219
Example one.

51
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,699
James is really preoccupied.

52
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,199
I think he's having some family problems.

53
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:46,979
Example two.

54
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,300
Oh, were you talking to me, honey?

55
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,020
I'm just really preoccupied with work.

57
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,419
All right, so very clear now.

58
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,639
Preoccupied.

59
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
Let's move on to our next word.

60
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,060
Direct impact.

61
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,159
Direct impact.

62
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,159
A direct impact.

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,780
All right, so again, Isabel told Anthony that the decision will have a direct impact on his career.

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,000
It will have a noticeable or impact or effect on his career.

65
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,560
Okay, so a direct impact.

66
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:24,439
And what about our last word?

67
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,259
Well, Anthony said, I resent that.

68
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:28,360
Resent.

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,199
Resent.

70
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,120
Okay, now this is spelled exactly like resent, like with an S.

71
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:34,719
That's right.

72
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,319
R-E-S-E-N-T.

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,419
But you pronounce it like a Z.

74
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:39,680
Resent.

75
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,580
Resent that.

76
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,159
So what does it mean if you say, I resent that?

77
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,620
It means I find that insulting.

78
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,439
I find that to be not true.

79
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes.

80
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,560
Okay, I resent that.

81
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,919
All right, well, how do you use this word?

82
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:56,939
Well, if somebody tells you you're lazy.

83
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,240
Okay, right.

84
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,740
Then you might say, hey, I resent that.

85
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,219
Right, I do a lot of work.

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,979
I'm not lazy.

87
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,740
Yeah, so it's always something that you use after someone insults you.

88
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,719
Right, or says something that you find to be not true.

89
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:13,900
Okay, resent that.

90
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,079
And I guess with this, it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

91
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,959
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

92
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:30,319
Hi Isabel, you wanted to see me?

93
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,240
Yes, Anthony, come on in and have a seat.

94
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:35,660
Is everything okay?

95
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:37,600
You seem a bit preoccupied.

96
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,439
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

97
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,579
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

98
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:48,579
Okay.

99
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,079
I don't want to beat around the bush.

100
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,920
So I'm just going to come out with it.

101
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,660
We're going to have to let you go.

102
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:55,939
What?

103
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:56,680
Why?

104
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,819
I mean, just like that.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,540
I'm fired.

106
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,839
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

107
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,759
What?

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,959
I resent that.

109
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:11,480
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,740
You called in sick eight times this month and you smell like alcohol.

111
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,560
Yeah, well there's some wonderful language in here that you can use when you have to have a difficult conversation with somebody.

112
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,860
Right, so let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

113
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:32,959
Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,939
We have three phrases here and the first one is to beat around the bush.

115
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,860
Okay, beat around the bush.

116
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,259
Beat around the bush.

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,980
Okay, so this is an idiomatic phrase.

118
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,860
So before we explain it, let's listen to somebody beating around the bush.

119
00:05:52,500 --> 00:06:01,839
Okay, the one thing that I want to tell you, it's so important that I don't like.

120
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,160
They, I always, sometimes when, all right, here's the deal.

121
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,019
This is it.

122
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,319
Specifically, it's not this.

123
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,899
It's not that.

124
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,399
It's not you.

125
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,120
It's not me.

126
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,360
It's everyone.

127
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,519
It's everything.

128
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,860
So as you can tell, the person has something to say, but they're taking a long time to say it, right?

130
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,220
You're kind of looking for the right or maybe more polite words to say something.

131
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:29,759
Exactly.

132
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,800
So that is to beat around the bush.

133
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,500
Now the opposite of to beat around the bush is to come out with it.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,139
Okay, come out with it.

135
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,920
Come out with it.

136
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,540
So maybe you're talking to your friend and he's beating around the bush so you can just say, hey, come out with it.

137
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,120
Tell me.

138
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,420
Tell me just what is it?

139
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:45,899
Exactly.

140
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:46,560
Right?

141
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,620
Come out with it.

142
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,120
Be direct.

143
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,519
When Isabel finally came out with it, she told Anthony that we're going to have to let you go.

144
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,680
Let you go.

145
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:56,420
Let you go.

146
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,740
So this is actually a nicer way of saying you're fired.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Yeah, it's a little bit more polite, isn't it?

148
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,240
Right.

149
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,779
It's we're going to have to let you go or.

150
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,560
Oh, I was let go from my company.

151
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,079
Right.

152
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,279
So a synonym for to be fired.

153
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,000
Exactly.

154
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:19,019
Okay, so let's listen to Anthony getting fired one more time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this difficult situation.

155
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,939
Hi, Isabel, you wanted to see me?

156
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,060
Yes, Anthony, come on in and have a seat.

157
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,000
Is everything okay?

158
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,939
You seem a bit preoccupied.

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,819
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

160
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:52,959
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

161
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:53,980
Okay.

162
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,480
I don't want to beat around the bush.

163
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,319
So I'm just going to come out with it.

164
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,060
We're going to have to let you go.

165
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,319
What?

166
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,040
Why?

167
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,199
I mean, just like that.

168
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:04,980
I'm fired.

169
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,259
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

170
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,120
What?

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,399
I resent that.

172
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,860
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

173
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,600
You called in sick eight times this month.

174
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,000
And you smell like alcohol.

175
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,360
So Erica, have you ever fired anyone?

176
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,939
I have fired a lot of people.

177
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:31,620
Oh, wow.

178
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,639
You are a mean person.

179
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,700
Oh, yeah.

180
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:40,240
Well, you know, there are some people who really do silly things like come to work drunk.

181
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,320
And if you do that, you're obviously going to get fired.

182
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,659
Yeah.

183
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,059
But in the United States, actually, there is an interesting way of firing people.

184
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,740
They get a pink slip.

185
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,059
Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,799
But I guess this is just a little bit different than getting fired.

187
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,700
This is you get a pink slip when you get laid off.

188
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,200
Right?

189
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,659
Yep.

190
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,820
I mean, if you come to work drunk, you get fired immediately.

191
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Right.

192
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:08,740
But when you get a pink slip, so it's basically a little pink paper that tells you that you have been laid off.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,019
Yeah.

194
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,840
And so when you hear somebody say we sent out.

195
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,259
Yeah.

196
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:25,500
So when you hear somebody talk about pink slips like we sent like our company sent out 500 pink slips, you know, that means that 500 people got laid off or I got a pink slip today.

197
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,840
That means you got laid off.

198
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,200
Right.

199
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,500
Yeah.

200
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,580
That's actually interesting because I don't know any other country that actually has this of special color, special color for firing people.

201
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,159
Yeah.

202
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,379
How about in your country?

203
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,419
Is there a special color for pink slips?

204
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:48,379
