00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're bringing you a great office lesson.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right, but actually I hope this situation never happens to any of our listeners.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Exactly.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we are firing somebody.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yikes.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It is a little bit complicated, but maybe you're an HR manager, maybe you are a supervisor, and you'll have to do this one day.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, gotta learn how, right?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Exactly.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Alright, well why don't we get started then, as we listen to Isabelle and Anthony.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hi Isabelle.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You wanted to see me?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes, Anthony.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Come on in and have a seat.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is everything okay?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You seem a bit preoccupied.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just gonna come out with it.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're gonna have to let you go.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I mean, just like that, I'm fired?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I resent that.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You called in sick eight times this month, and you smell like alcohol.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He did sound a little bit like he had too much to drink.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I know, he had that kind of slur.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, that slow way of talking that made him seem a little bit drunk.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, that's definitely something you don't want to do is show up to work with alcohol in your breath.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Exactly, but you know what?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There's a lot of great language in this dialogue, so why don't we take a look at it now in language takeaway.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Language takeaway.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, well, I want to look at three words here.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now, the first one, Anthony said that Isabel was preoccupied.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Preoccupied.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Preoccupied.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, so if somebody is preoccupied.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They're not focused.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Maybe they're a little bit worried.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, they're thinking of something else.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why don't we take a listen to a few examples of how this word is used.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Example one.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
James is really preoccupied.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think he's having some family problems.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Example two.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, were you talking to me, honey?

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm just really preoccupied with work.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
All right, so very clear now.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Preoccupied.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's move on to our next word.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Direct impact.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Direct impact.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A direct impact.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
All right, so again, Isabel told Anthony that the decision will have a direct impact on his career.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It will have a noticeable or impact or effect on his career.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, so a direct impact.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And what about our last word?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, Anthony said, I resent that.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Resent.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Resent.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, now this is spelled exactly like resent, like with an S.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
R-E-S-E-N-T.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But you pronounce it like a Z.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Resent.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Resent that.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So what does it mean if you say, I resent that?

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It means I find that insulting.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I find that to be not true.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, I resent that.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All right, well, how do you use this word?

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, if somebody tells you you're lazy.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, right.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then you might say, hey, I resent that.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Right, I do a lot of work.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm not lazy.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, so it's always something that you use after someone insults you.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, or says something that you find to be not true.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, resent that.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And I guess with this, it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hi Isabel, you wanted to see me?

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, Anthony, come on in and have a seat.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Is everything okay?

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You seem a bit preoccupied.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want to beat around the bush.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I'm just going to come out with it.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're going to have to let you go.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why?

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I mean, just like that.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm fired.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What?

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I resent that.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You called in sick eight times this month and you smell like alcohol.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah, well there's some wonderful language in here that you can use when you have to have a difficult conversation with somebody.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Right, so let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Fluency Builder.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We have three phrases here and the first one is to beat around the bush.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, beat around the bush.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Beat around the bush.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay, so this is an idiomatic phrase.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So before we explain it, let's listen to somebody beating around the bush.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, the one thing that I want to tell you, it's so important that I don't like.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They, I always, sometimes when, all right, here's the deal.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is it.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Specifically, it's not this.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not that.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's not you.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not me.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's everyone.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's everything.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So as you can tell, the person has something to say, but they're taking a long time to say it, right?

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're kind of looking for the right or maybe more polite words to say something.

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So that is to beat around the bush.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now the opposite of to beat around the bush is to come out with it.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay, come out with it.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Come out with it.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So maybe you're talking to your friend and he's beating around the bush so you can just say, hey, come out with it.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Tell me.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Tell me just what is it?

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Exactly.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right?

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Come out with it.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Be direct.

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When Isabel finally came out with it, she told Anthony that we're going to have to let you go.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let you go.

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let you go.

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So this is actually a nicer way of saying you're fired.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, it's a little bit more polite, isn't it?

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Right.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's we're going to have to let you go or.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, I was let go from my company.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So a synonym for to be fired.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Exactly.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, so let's listen to Anthony getting fired one more time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this difficult situation.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hi, Isabel, you wanted to see me?

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, Anthony, come on in and have a seat.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is everything okay?

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You seem a bit preoccupied.

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want to beat around the bush.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I'm just going to come out with it.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We're going to have to let you go.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Why?

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I mean, just like that.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm fired.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I resent that.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You called in sick eight times this month.

174
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And you smell like alcohol.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So Erica, have you ever fired anyone?

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have fired a lot of people.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, wow.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are a mean person.

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, yeah.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, you know, there are some people who really do silly things like come to work drunk.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And if you do that, you're obviously going to get fired.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But in the United States, actually, there is an interesting way of firing people.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They get a pink slip.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I guess this is just a little bit different than getting fired.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is you get a pink slip when you get laid off.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Right?

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yep.

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I mean, if you come to work drunk, you get fired immediately.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Right.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But when you get a pink slip, so it's basically a little pink paper that tells you that you have been laid off.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And so when you hear somebody say we sent out.

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So when you hear somebody talk about pink slips like we sent like our company sent out 500 pink slips, you know, that means that 500 people got laid off or I got a pink slip today.

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That means you got laid off.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right.

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's actually interesting because I don't know any other country that actually has this of special color, special color for firing people.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How about in your country?

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Is there a special color for pink slips?

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
