EnglishPod.com Hi Isabel, you wanted to see me?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes, Anthony.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Come on in and have a seat.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Is everything okay?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You seem a bit preoccupied.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to have to let you go.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I mean, just like that, I'm fired?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I resent that.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You called in sick eight times this month, and you smell like alcohol.
