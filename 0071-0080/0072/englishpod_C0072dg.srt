EnglishPod.com Hi Isabel, you wanted to see me?

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,500
Yes, Anthony.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,539
Come on in and have a seat.

4
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,420
Is everything okay?

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,420
You seem a bit preoccupied.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,300
Well, Anthony, this is not going to be an easy conversation.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,439
The company has made some decisions which will have a direct impact on your employment.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,399
Okay.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,740
I don't want to beat around the bush, so I'm just going to come out with it.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,500
We're going to have to let you go.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:41,799
What?

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,539
Why?

13
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,399
I mean, just like that, I'm fired?

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,700
I'm sorry, but to be honest, you're a terrible employee.

15
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:50,640
What?

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,540
I resent that.

17
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:57,359
Anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone.

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:03,520
You called in sick eight times this month, and you smell like alcohol.
