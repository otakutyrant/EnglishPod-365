1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,379
Thank God you showed up when you did.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,679
He's insane.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,859
Do you think we should call the police?

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,779
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,820
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,039
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:16,940
What a nutjob.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,859
I know.

9
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,440
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,500
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,440
Don't apologize.

13
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,380
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,859
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just scared, Veronica.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,100
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

16
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:44,079
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,960
We were made for each other, Veronica.

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:49,359
You're my everything, my soulmate.

19
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:50,979
What can I do?

20
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,380
Just hold me.

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,079
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,479
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

23
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,280
I believe in us, Steven.

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,740
I'm so happy to hear that.

25
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,560
I know we belong together.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,500
I love you so much.
