1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank God you showed up when you did.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
He's insane.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you think we should call the police?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What a nutjob.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I know.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't apologize.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just scared, Veronica.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We were made for each other, Veronica.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're my everything, my soulmate.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What can I do?

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Just hold me.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And together, we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I believe in us, Steven.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know we belong together.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I love you so much.
