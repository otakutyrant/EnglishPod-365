00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,139
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:05,879
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:06,639
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:07,620
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,259
And today we're bringing you, again, our romantic, dramatic suspense series, I'm Sorry, I Love You, Part 7.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,859
So we're going to find out what's happening with Steven and Veronica.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,399
Right.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,980
In the last episode, Veronica was at the doctor's, she was pregnant.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,320
But then the doctor told her it was a lie and he made it up and she wasn't even pregnant.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,120
Exactly.

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,700
So now let's see what Veronica and Steven are going to say to each other.

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,719
Maybe they will break up.

13
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:35,219
I don't know.

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,140
I don't think so.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,899
But let's listen.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank God you showed up when you did.

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,359
He's insane.

18
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,520
Do you think we should call the police?

19
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:54,179
Don't worry about it.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,420
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

21
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,679
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,600
What a nut job.

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,560
I know.

24
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,060
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

25
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,959
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,140
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,060
Don't apologize.

28
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,040
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,519
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared, Veronica.

30
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,859
The thought of not being with you.

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,680
I mean, I just can't handle it.

32
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,519
We were made for each other, Veronica.

33
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,500
You're my everything.

34
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,000
My soulmate.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,599
What can I do?

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
Just hold me.

37
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,719
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

38
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,079
And together we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

39
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,900
I believe in us, Steven.

40
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,359
I'm so happy to hear that.

41
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,180
I know we belong together.

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,060
I love you so much.

43
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,240
Oh, it was such a romantic moment.

44
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,219
And now what happened?

45
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,099
Somebody got shot.

46
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,759
Oh my God.

47
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,340
I don't know.

48
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,819
This is like so big.

49
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,340
I can't believe this is happening.

50
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:28,479
Well, it's a very intense drama, but we saw some great words and a lot of great phrases in there when Steven was telling her all these beautiful words, right?

51
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,080
That's right.

52
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,759
So why don't we look at some of these words now in Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,780
Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:43,060
Veronica was glad or wish she was very happy that Steven showed up.

55
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:43,919
That's right.

56
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:45,159
Showed up.

57
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,580
So to show up.

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:46,960
Right.

59
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,180
To come to a place.

60
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:48,719
Okay.

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,659
Or to arrive.

62
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,219
That's right.

63
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,000
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use show up in different contexts.

64
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,120
Example one.

65
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,819
We were waiting for you like an hour and you never showed up.

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,460
Example two.

67
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,639
I didn't invite him to the party.

68
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,139
He just simply showed up uninvited.

69
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,919
Example three.

70
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,879
After months of being lost, my dog finally showed up with a family.

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,939
All right.

72
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:29,580
So I think it's pretty clear now the verb show up.

73
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,960
And I think this verb is a little bit informal, isn't it?

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,259
Yes.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,099
You wouldn't really tell your boss, hey, I'm waiting for you to show up.

76
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Yeah.

77
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:36,800
Yeah.

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
It's a bit too informal.

79
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,879
As you know, the doctor, he was stalking Veronica.

80
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,639
That's right.

81
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
So that's our next word.

82
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,759
Stock.

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,020
To stalk somebody.

84
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,719
S-T-A-L-K.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,240
Okay.

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,719
Stock.

87
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,099
Now this isn't a good thing, right?

88
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:53,659
No, this is bad.

89
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,199
So what happens when you stalk someone?

90
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,460
You follow them secretly for a long time.

91
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,120
And then maybe you watch them.

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,080
Yeah, like you have standing outside their window watching them get undressed or something.

93
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:08,879
Okay.

94
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,780
So many famous people have stalkers, right?

95
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:12,979
Yeah, which is the noun.

96
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,560
The noun form, exactly.

97
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,879
So if I am stalking somebody, I am considered to be a stalker.

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,420
Yes.

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,779
So to stalk.

100
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,860
So don't do this.

101
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,180
So Steven described this stalker as a nut job.

102
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:27,139
A nut job.

103
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:27,879
Nut job.

104
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:28,899
A nut job.

105
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:29,220
Okay.

106
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,480
Very, very informal.

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,139
And it doesn't really mean anything literally, but it's crazy.

108
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:35,620
Yes.

109
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,000
It means a crazy person.

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,980
A crazy person.

111
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:38,759
What a nut job.

112
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,779
He's a nut job.

113
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,540
Okay.

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,660
So would you really call this to someone like to their face?

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,180
No, no, definitely not.

116
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
It's definitely impolite.

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:46,980
Right.

118
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:49,079
You can't say to someone, oh, you're a nut job.

119
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,800
Yeah, but it's not a swear word.

120
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,060
No, but it's a little bit insulting, right?

121
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,740
It's like saying you're crazy, but stronger.

122
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,439
Well, the doctor was a nut job.

123
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,519
He was stalking her and she apologized to Steven for getting him worked up.

124
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,579
Worked up.

125
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,180
So work up.

126
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,639
To be worked up.

127
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,600
When you get worked up, what happens?

128
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:16,120
You get really emotional and usually angry or sad or upset, but a negative emotion.

129
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,300
Okay, so you got worked up.

130
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,879
So it's always used with the verb to get.

131
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,259
So to get worked up.

132
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,639
Okay, you get worked up.

133
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,759
You got worked up.

134
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,959
Okay, very good.

135
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,699
And well, Steven got worked up over nothing, but he didn't mind.

136
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,620
He said she is his love and he called her his soulmate.

137
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,019
His soulmate.

138
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:36,939
Soulmate.

139
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,720
That's right.

140
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:42,779
A very romantic word, meaning the perfect person for you.

141
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:43,079
Right.

142
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,079
Your other half.

143
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:44,620
Yes.

144
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,240
Okay.

145
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,779
So your soulmate is that perfect compliment for you.

146
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:50,160
And it's usually romantic, right?

147
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,699
Usually romantic, but sometimes you might use it with your very, very, very best friend.

148
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:55,199
Okay.

149
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,100
Because you understand each other.

150
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,560
Yeah.

151
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,480
You know what the other one's thinking.

152
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,199
You're the perfect fit together.

153
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:01,639
Okay.

154
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:02,399
Soulmate.

155
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,800
Very good.

156
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:09,199
Well, we've seen some really interesting words, so why don't we listen to her dialogue again?

157
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,600
And then we'll come back and look at some of the phrases that were used.

158
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,779
Thank God you showed up when you did.

159
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
He's insane.

160
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,319
Do you think we should call the police?

161
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry about it.

162
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,240
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

163
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,500
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

164
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,399
What a nut job.

165
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:31,420
I know.

166
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,879
Well, he said, I'm not pregnant.

167
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,079
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

168
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,279
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

169
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,459
Don't apologize from the moment I met you.

170
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,259
Not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

171
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,980
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared.

172
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,620
Veronica, the closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

173
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,939
The thought of not being with you.

174
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,639
I mean, I just can't handle it.

175
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,100
We were made for each other.

176
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,480
Veronica, you're my everything.

177
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:02,899
My soulmate.

178
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,519
What can I do?

179
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:05,920
Just hold me.

180
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,600
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

181
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,980
And together we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

182
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,800
I believe in us, Stephen.

183
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,240
I'm so happy to hear that.

184
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,040
I know we belong together.

185
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,100
I love you so much.

186
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,639
That was a little bit more clear this time.

187
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:34,079
But now I want to look at some phrases in the dialogue and see how they can be put together.

188
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,040
Putting it together.

189
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:44,360
So Veronica apologized to Stephen for getting him worked up over nothing.

190
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,399
Over nothing.

191
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,279
Over nothing.

192
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,160
Now it's the complete sentence.

193
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:51,519
I'm sorry for getting you worked up over nothing.

194
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,439
So over nothing means for no reason, right?

195
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,300
Right, exactly.

196
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,959
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use over nothing.

197
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,100
Example one.

198
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,579
You always get angry over nothing.

199
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,680
You have such a bad temper.

200
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,560
Example two.

201
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,079
I called the police last night over nothing.

202
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,060
I thought I had a thief in my house.

203
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,819
Example three.

204
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,600
Let's not fight over nothing.

205
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,180
Let's just have dinner in peace.

206
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,039
Okay, so we see you can use many different verbs together with over nothing.

207
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,399
So get excited over nothing.

208
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,059
Get angry over nothing.

209
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,700
Get upset over nothing.

210
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,360
Exactly.

211
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:42,700
Very good.

212
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:43,799
So over nothing.

213
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,740
And now for our next phrase.

214
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:54,559
So when Stephen was telling Veronica how much he loved her, he told her, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

215
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,960
So not a day has gone by.

216
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,580
So that part of the sentence, not a day has gone by.

217
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,720
What does he mean by that?

218
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:05,000
He means basically every day I think of you.

219
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,220
There hasn't been a moment where I haven't thought of you.

220
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,179
Now, how can we change it a little bit?

221
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,779
What can we change within this phrase?

222
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,879
Well, you can put in different times.

223
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:14,379
Okay.

224
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,200
So not a day has gone by, not an hour has gone by, not a moment has gone by.

225
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,080
Not a month, not a year.

226
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,759
Exactly.

227
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,419
Okay.

228
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:30,620
So you can use different times in that phrase, but an important thing is that the compliment is always negative, right?

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,100
That's right.

230
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,899
So it's always followed by a negative.

231
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,460
Not a day has gone by that I haven't wished you were here.

232
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:37,779
Okay.

233
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,240
So it's followed by a negative.

234
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,120
That's right.

235
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,559
Maybe one more.

236
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,980
Not a second has gone by that I haven't missed you.

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,779
Okay.

238
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,820
Very good examples.

239
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,720
Very romantic.

240
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,559
Oh, Marco.

241
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,860
Alright.

242
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,019
And now our last phrase.

243
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,279
He told her, I'll always be here for you no matter what.

244
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,440
No matter what.

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,720
No matter what.

246
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,620
What does he mean by that?

247
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,980
Well, regardless of or, you know, nothing's going to stop me.

248
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,399
Okay.

249
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:11,220
So if I want to get that job, I'm going to get it no matter what.

250
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,480
So nothing's gonna stop you.

251
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,519
Now we can change the WH word of what at the end, right?

252
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:16,799
Yeah.

253
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,820
Other ones.

254
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,399
Exactly.

255
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,080
So no matter where, no matter where you are, I will find you.

256
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,419
Yeah.

257
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,940
No matter when, no matter when your birthday is, I will be there.

258
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,580
That's right.

259
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,179
You can see how you can use different WH words here.

260
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:31,879
Okay.

261
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,360
Very good.

262
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,580
And it's a very common phrase, right?

263
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:34,799
Yeah.

264
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,120
No matter what, no matter where, no matter when, no matter why, no matter how.

265
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:39,419
Yeah.

266
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,100
No matter how.

267
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:40,519
Okay.

268
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:48,139
So those were some really great phrases, and I think you can play with them a little bit, change some things, and then you can use them in your everyday life.

269
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:49,200
That's right.

270
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,559
But why don't we hear them again one more time in context with the dialogue?

271
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,480
Thank God you showed up when you did.

272
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:05,860
He's insane.

273
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,960
Do you think we should call the police?

274
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:09,679
Oh, don't worry about it.

275
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,940
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

276
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,200
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

277
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,100
What a nut job.

278
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,059
I know.

279
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,580
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

280
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,460
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,659
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

282
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,600
Don't apologize.

283
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,500
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

284
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,000
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared, Veronica.

285
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,240
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

286
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,220
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

287
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,059
We were made for each other, Veronica.

288
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,019
You're my everything.

289
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,500
My soulmate.

290
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,159
What can I do?

291
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,519
Just hold me.

292
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,220
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

293
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,639
And together we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

294
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,419
I believe in us, Steven.

295
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,879
I'm so happy to hear that.

296
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,700
I know we belong together.

297
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:12,139
I love you so much.

298
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,460
Okay, Erica, so who do you think got shot?

299
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,679
I don't know, but I'm starting to think this story is becoming a soap opera.

300
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:34,039
Well, it certainly is.

301
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,679
And well, what do you guys think happened?

302
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,899
Or who do you think got shot?

303
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,480
Or who did the shooting?

304
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,379
Who shot who?

305
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,080
Maybe it wasn't even a gunshot.

306
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,580
Maybe it was just the car.

307
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,940
The tire could have popped.

308
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,700
I don't know.

309
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,700
So well, come to our website.

310
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,519

311
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,240
