00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And today we're bringing you, again, our romantic, dramatic suspense series, I'm Sorry, I Love You, Part 7.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we're going to find out what's happening with Steven and Veronica.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the last episode, Veronica was at the doctor's, she was pregnant.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
But then the doctor told her it was a lie and he made it up and she wasn't even pregnant.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So now let's see what Veronica and Steven are going to say to each other.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Maybe they will break up.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't think so.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But let's listen.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank God you showed up when you did.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He's insane.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Do you think we should call the police?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't worry about it.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What a nut job.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I know.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't apologize.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared, Veronica.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The thought of not being with you.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I mean, I just can't handle it.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We were made for each other, Veronica.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You're my everything.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
My soulmate.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What can I do?

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just hold me.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And together we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I believe in us, Steven.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I know we belong together.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I love you so much.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, it was such a romantic moment.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And now what happened?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Somebody got shot.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh my God.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't know.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is like so big.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't believe this is happening.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, it's a very intense drama, but we saw some great words and a lot of great phrases in there when Steven was telling her all these beautiful words, right?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So why don't we look at some of these words now in Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Veronica was glad or wish she was very happy that Steven showed up.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Showed up.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So to show up.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
To come to a place.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Or to arrive.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's right.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use show up in different contexts.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Example one.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We were waiting for you like an hour and you never showed up.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Example two.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't invite him to the party.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He just simply showed up uninvited.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Example three.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
After months of being lost, my dog finally showed up with a family.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
All right.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So I think it's pretty clear now the verb show up.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And I think this verb is a little bit informal, isn't it?

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You wouldn't really tell your boss, hey, I'm waiting for you to show up.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a bit too informal.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
As you know, the doctor, he was stalking Veronica.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So that's our next word.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Stock.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To stalk somebody.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
S-T-A-L-K.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Stock.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now this isn't a good thing, right?

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, this is bad.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So what happens when you stalk someone?

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You follow them secretly for a long time.

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And then maybe you watch them.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, like you have standing outside their window watching them get undressed or something.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So many famous people have stalkers, right?

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, which is the noun.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The noun form, exactly.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So if I am stalking somebody, I am considered to be a stalker.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So to stalk.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So don't do this.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So Steven described this stalker as a nut job.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A nut job.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Nut job.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A nut job.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Very, very informal.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And it doesn't really mean anything literally, but it's crazy.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It means a crazy person.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A crazy person.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What a nut job.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's a nut job.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So would you really call this to someone like to their face?

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no, definitely not.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's definitely impolite.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You can't say to someone, oh, you're a nut job.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, but it's not a swear word.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No, but it's a little bit insulting, right?

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's like saying you're crazy, but stronger.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, the doctor was a nut job.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He was stalking her and she apologized to Steven for getting him worked up.

124
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Worked up.

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So work up.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
To be worked up.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
When you get worked up, what happens?

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You get really emotional and usually angry or sad or upset, but a negative emotion.

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, so you got worked up.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So it's always used with the verb to get.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So to get worked up.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay, you get worked up.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You got worked up.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, very good.

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And well, Steven got worked up over nothing, but he didn't mind.

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He said she is his love and he called her his soulmate.

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
His soulmate.

138
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Soulmate.

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A very romantic word, meaning the perfect person for you.

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right.

142
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Your other half.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So your soulmate is that perfect compliment for you.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And it's usually romantic, right?

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Usually romantic, but sometimes you might use it with your very, very, very best friend.

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because you understand each other.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You know what the other one's thinking.

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're the perfect fit together.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

154
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Soulmate.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Very good.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, we've seen some really interesting words, so why don't we listen to her dialogue again?

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And then we'll come back and look at some of the phrases that were used.

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank God you showed up when you did.

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He's insane.

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Do you think we should call the police?

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't worry about it.

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

163
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What a nut job.

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I know.

166
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, he said, I'm not pregnant.

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

168
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't apologize from the moment I met you.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared.

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Veronica, the closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The thought of not being with you.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I mean, I just can't handle it.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We were made for each other.

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Veronica, you're my everything.

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
My soulmate.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What can I do?

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just hold me.

180
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll always be here for you no matter what.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And together we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I believe in us, Stephen.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I know we belong together.

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I love you so much.

186
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That was a little bit more clear this time.

187
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But now I want to look at some phrases in the dialogue and see how they can be put together.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Putting it together.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So Veronica apologized to Stephen for getting him worked up over nothing.

190
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Over nothing.

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Over nothing.

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now it's the complete sentence.

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry for getting you worked up over nothing.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So over nothing means for no reason, right?

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right, exactly.

196
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So why don't we listen to some other examples of how we can use over nothing.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Example one.

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You always get angry over nothing.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You have such a bad temper.

200
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Example two.

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I called the police last night over nothing.

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I thought I had a thief in my house.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Example three.

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's not fight over nothing.

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's just have dinner in peace.

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay, so we see you can use many different verbs together with over nothing.

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So get excited over nothing.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Get angry over nothing.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Get upset over nothing.

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Exactly.

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Very good.

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So over nothing.

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And now for our next phrase.

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So when Stephen was telling Veronica how much he loved her, he told her, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So not a day has gone by.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So that part of the sentence, not a day has gone by.

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What does he mean by that?

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He means basically every day I think of you.

219
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There hasn't been a moment where I haven't thought of you.

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, how can we change it a little bit?

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What can we change within this phrase?

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, you can put in different times.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So not a day has gone by, not an hour has gone by, not a moment has gone by.

225
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Not a month, not a year.

226
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Exactly.

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

228
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So you can use different times in that phrase, but an important thing is that the compliment is always negative, right?

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So it's always followed by a negative.

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Not a day has gone by that I haven't wished you were here.

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

233
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So it's followed by a negative.

234
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's right.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Maybe one more.

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Not a second has gone by that I haven't missed you.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Very good examples.

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Very romantic.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, Marco.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Alright.

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And now our last phrase.

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He told her, I'll always be here for you no matter what.

244
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No matter what.

245
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No matter what.

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What does he mean by that?

247
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, regardless of or, you know, nothing's going to stop me.

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

249
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So if I want to get that job, I'm going to get it no matter what.

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So nothing's gonna stop you.

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now we can change the WH word of what at the end, right?

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

253
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Other ones.

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Exactly.

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So no matter where, no matter where you are, I will find you.

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah.

257
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No matter when, no matter when your birthday is, I will be there.

258
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can see how you can use different WH words here.

260
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Very good.

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And it's a very common phrase, right?

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yeah.

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No matter what, no matter where, no matter when, no matter why, no matter how.

265
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah.

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No matter how.

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So those were some really great phrases, and I think you can play with them a little bit, change some things, and then you can use them in your everyday life.

269
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right.

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But why don't we hear them again one more time in context with the dialogue?

271
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank God you showed up when you did.

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's insane.

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you think we should call the police?

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, don't worry about it.

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll call my friend and have him take care of it.

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't believe he was stalking you all these years.

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What a nut job.

278
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I know.

279
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, he said I'm not pregnant.

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing.

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose.

282
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't apologize.

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
From the moment I met you, not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you.

284
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And now that I'm with you again, I'm just, I'm just scared, Veronica.

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

286
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The thought of not being with you, I mean, I just can't handle it.

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We were made for each other, Veronica.

288
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're my everything.

289
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
My soulmate.

290
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What can I do?

291
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Just hold me.

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll always be here for you, no matter what.

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And together we can tackle whatever life throws at us.

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I believe in us, Steven.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm so happy to hear that.

296
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I know we belong together.

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I love you so much.

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay, Erica, so who do you think got shot?

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know, but I'm starting to think this story is becoming a soap opera.

300
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, it certainly is.

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And well, what do you guys think happened?

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Or who do you think got shot?

303
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Or who did the shooting?

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Who shot who?

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Maybe it wasn't even a gunshot.

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe it was just the car.

307
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The tire could have popped.

308
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know.

309
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So well, come to our website.

310
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000

311
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
