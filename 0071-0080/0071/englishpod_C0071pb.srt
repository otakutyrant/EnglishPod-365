00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,359
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,040
We are here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,179
I am joined with Erica.

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,400
And my partner in crime, Marco.

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:10,160
All right.

7
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,400
So today we're going to be talking about a really great topic, one of my favorites.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,539
Beer.

9
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,179
Beer.

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:21,820
So beer is a very popular drink, especially in bars and when you go out.

11
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:22,140
Yes.

12
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:24,039
It's very common with students, I think.

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,480
Yes.

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,219
And it's also not very strong like vodka or whiskey.

15
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:28,760
Yes.

16
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,440
OK.

17
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:36,179
So we are going to be at a bar today and we're going to be looking at some of this vocabulary that you would find.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:36,899
Yes.

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,820
I mean, you've got to know this beer vocabulary.

20
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:41,539
OK.

21
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,899
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at these words.

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,039
Hey, man, what do you have on top?

23
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,820
Heineken and Budweiser.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,820
We have a two for one happy hour special.

25
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:04,859
Cool.

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,379
Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

27
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,359
OK.

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,359
Pint of Heineken, half a pint of Bud for table six.

29
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,340
What about some appetizers?

30
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,019
Sure.

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,079
Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

32
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:19,939
OK.

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,980
That'll be 80 bucks.

34
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:21,700
What?

35
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:22,620
What?

36
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:35,159
Well, it's pretty expensive for two beers and some food.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:35,700
Yes.

38
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,659
Well, it happens sometimes you go to these very exclusive bars and they charge you like if it was gold.

39
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,140
I mean, that's crazy.

40
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,420
Well, let's take a look at some of these great words that we saw in language takeaway.

41
00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:52,459
Language takeaway.

42
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,540
Our first word is on tap.

43
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,079
On tap.

44
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,019
On tap.

45
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,159
So he asked, what do you have on tap?

46
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,400
Now, this is a strange sentence.

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,620
What exactly does it mean?

48
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,120
OK, well, he's asking about what beers the bar has.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,580
But not in a bottle or not in a can.

50
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:12,939
Right.

51
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:16,580
So, you know, in a bar, there's often this machine.

52
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,039
Right.

53
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,759
That that will pour very fresh beer right directly into the glass, into the glass.

54
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:23,719
Yeah.

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,800
This is a very popular thing because, like you say, it's fresh beer.

56
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,060
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,879
It tastes better.

58
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:29,620
Tastes better.

59
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:29,960
Yeah.

60
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:30,479
OK.

61
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,219
So what do you have on tap?

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,280
What do you have on tap?

63
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:34,939
All right.

64
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,460
Let's take a look at our second word.

65
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:37,699
Happy hour.

66
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:38,780
Happy hour.

67
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,020
Happy hour.

68
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:40,979
Happy hour.

69
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,740
Now, this is very common and popular with bars.

70
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:44,139
Yes.

71
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,500
What is it when they have a happy hour?

72
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:46,900
OK.

73
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,240
A happy hour is a period of time where the drinks are very cheap.

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:53,939
OK.

75
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,479
So happy hour could be from 5 p.m.

76
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,780
till 10 p.m.

77
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,520
50 percent off.

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,400
So if the drink is four dollars, then it is now two dollars in happy hour.

79
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:06,360
Perfect.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,080
And this brings us to our third word.

81
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,199
A special.

82
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,120
A special.

83
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,419
A special.

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,039
A special.

85
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,460
So this is a noun.

86
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,740
And what does it mean when a restaurant or a bar has a special?

87
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,699
It's like they're having a sale.

88
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:21,419
A sale.

89
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:22,719
So things are cheaper.

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,520
So it could be, for example, a Monday night special.

91
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,379
Or like in the dialog, a happy hour special.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,180
OK.

93
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,879
So it is a promotion.

94
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:34,360
Yes.

95
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,060
All right.

96
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,620
Very good.

97
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,740
And now they ordered a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Budweiser.

98
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,340
Mm hmm.

99
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,020
Pint.

100
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,400
This is a very, very special beer word.

101
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,360
So a pint is the size of your glass.

102
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,199
OK.

103
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,680
So we understand how much a pint is.

104
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,780
Well, how what is what would be the equivalent in liters?

105
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:00,400
A pint is zero point four liters.

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,120
OK.

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,219
So almost half a liter is one pint.

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:04,580
Yes.

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,759
OK.

110
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,439
It is very common when you go into a bar, you can order a pint of beer.

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,300
Yes, exactly.

112
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:13,759
In English, we don't say I'll have half a liter of beer.

113
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,280
Right.

114
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:14,680
Right.

115
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,839
So let's take a look at our next word on language takeaway.

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,319
Appetizers.

117
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,500
Appetizers.

118
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,579
Appetizers.

119
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:22,279
Appetizers.

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,339
OK.

121
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,300
So what is an appetizer?

122
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,259
Well, it is food you eat before your dinner.

123
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,000
Or before your lunch.

124
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:32,600
OK.

125
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,120
So it's usually maybe like a salad.

126
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,439
Or a soup.

127
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,459
Or something small that you can eat right before your big meal.

128
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,180
OK.

129
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,639
So some common appetizers at a bar and we saw them in our dialogue.

130
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,319
Nachos and mozzarella sticks.

131
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:49,540
Nachos.

132
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,100
Nachos.

133
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,160
Nachos.

134
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:52,800
Nachos.

135
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,959
So nachos are little chips, right?

136
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,220
Yeah.

137
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,300
Corn chips.

138
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:04,199
And it has cheese and maybe some tomatoes and maybe some beans.

139
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,180
OK.

140
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:06,740
So those are nachos.

141
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,819
They're very common in the United States.

142
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:09,100
Yes.

143
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,439
And what about mozzarella sticks?

144
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,839
Mozzarella sticks.

145
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,100
A travesty on the world and humanity and everyone's arteries.

146
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,100
Well, mozzarella is a cheese, right?

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,579
Mozzarella cheese.

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,180
And this cheese, how is it prepared?

149
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,019
You put it in some bread crumbs and then you fry it in oil.

150
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,360
You deep fry it.

151
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:32,560
And you don't like this?

152
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,500
No, this is terrible.

153
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,019
Why?

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,839
They're so good.

155
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,819
Oh my God.

156
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,079
Because then you can dip it in a little sauce and it's delicious.

157
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,680
Marco, there are so many reasons why this is wrong.

158
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:42,759
All right.

159
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:45,980
Well, mozzarella sticks, a very popular bar food.

160
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,740
All right.

161
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:53,519
Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be able to hear these words in context at a slower speed.

162
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,279
Hey man, what do you have on top?

163
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,120
Heineken and Budweiser.

164
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,139
We have a two for one happy hour special.

165
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,160
Cool.

166
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,680
Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

167
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,639
Okay.

168
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,680
Pint of Heineken, half a pint of Bud for table six.

169
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,639
What about some appetizers?

170
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:22,339
Sure.

171
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,540
Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

172
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,399
Okay.

173
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,459
That'll be 80 bucks.

174
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,199
What?

175
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:34,139
Okay.

176
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,180
So we saw some really good vocabulary words there.

177
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,379
And now let's take a look at putting it together.

178
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,199
Putting it together.

179
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:52,839
Well, in this lesson, we are going to look at one phrase that sometimes causes problems.

180
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,160
So let's listen to this phrase that we're talking about.

181
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,399
What about some appetizers?

182
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,500
What about some appetizers?

183
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,120
Okay.

184
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
So this phrase, what about?

185
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:06,180
Yeah.

186
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,259
I often hear people use it to ask a question.

187
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,740
So a common mistake is asking, what about your weekend?

188
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,639
What about your new job?

189
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,019
Now, this is incorrect, right?

190
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:26,300
You cannot use the phrase what about to ask a question about information.

191
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,060
So you cannot ask for information.

192
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,639
Okay.

193
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,579
Because in our dialogue, the bartender said, and what about some appetizers?

194
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:35,060
Right.

195
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,319
Because he is making a suggestion.

196
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,920
Right.

197
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,500
So he's saying, well, why don't you have some food?

198
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:41,439
Yes.

199
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,579
The phrase what about can be used to make a suggestion.

200
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:46,480
Okay.

201
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,339
So I can say, what about going to the movies?

202
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,180
You know what?

203
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,720
Let's hear a few more examples of this because I think it's really useful.

204
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,220
Example one.

205
00:07:58,259 --> 00:07:59,740
What about these dirty clothes?

206
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,379
You said you would wash them days ago.

207
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,000
Example two.

208
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,259
What about going to the mall instead?

209
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,259
I'm tired of going to the movies.

210
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,040
Example three.

211
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,660
What about a pizza instead of noodles?

212
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:18,600
All right.

213
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,579
So really good examples and the same thing we can apply to how about.

214
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:24,220
Exactly.

215
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,699
So again, how about cannot ask for information.

216
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,600
Okay.

217
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,220
So you can't say how about your boss.

218
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:30,980
All right.

219
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:31,399
Perfect.

220
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:31,879
Okay.

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,540
So let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about bars and beers.

222
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,299
Hey man, what do you have on top?

223
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,059
Heineken and Budweiser.

224
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,100
We have a two for one happy hour special.

225
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,120
Cool.

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,639
Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

227
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,620
Okay.

228
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,620
Pint of Heineken, half a pint of Bud for table six.

229
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,600
What about some appetizers?

230
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:03,340
Sure.

231
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,320
Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

232
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,200
Okay.

233
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,220
That'll be 80 bucks.

234
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:09,980
What?

235
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:23,320
Well Marco, I know you're a big fan of beer and actually I think everyone here at Praxis is a big beer drinker.

236
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,200
And this is the perfect opportunity to tell everyone about the world renowned beer shake.

237
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,659
Oh my God.

238
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,039
Okay Marco.

239
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,259
All right.

240
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,799
So everyone that listens to this recipe is a non-believer.

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,799
They say that it is not possible for it to taste good.

242
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,220
Okay.

243
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,200
But here's the recipe.

244
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,879
You take a liter of beer or maybe half a liter.

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,740
So a pint?

246
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,460
A pint or a pint and a half.

247
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,019
And you put it in the blender.

248
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,320
All right.

249
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,659
Now you take two eggs.

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,399
Uh huh.

251
00:09:59,500 --> 00:09:59,779
Okay.

252
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,559
Not cooked, not boiled, anything.

253
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,419
You take two eggs and put them in the blender.

254
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,379
It could be one or two.

255
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:04,879
Okay.

256
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,799
And then you take about half a cup of sugar.

257
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,039
Put it in the blender.

258
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:16,080
And you mix all that together and you get this really good foamy delicious beer shake.

259
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,460
So a beer milkshake.

260
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,159
Well it has no milk.

261
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:20,799
Okay.

262
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,100
But it's actually really good.

263
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,460
I've prepared it for some people and they're like no that's not possible it can't taste good.

264
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,240
And in the end they're like wow this is actually pretty good.

265
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,919
So did you invent this recipe?

266
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,940
It's actually really common in Ecuador, in Peru.

267
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,379
I've even seen it in Chile.

268
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,980
Usually with a dark beer.

269
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:42,440
Right.

270
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,000
So like a Guinness or?

271
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,720
It could be a Guinness or yeah.

272
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,500
If it's that, a dark beer is a little bit sweeter so you wouldn't add so much sugar.

273
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:59,899
But if you have another beer like a lager or a stout you could still do it but just add a little bit more sugar because that beer is a little bit more bitter.

274
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:00,399
Okay.

275
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,259
Well I am not going to try this recipe but maybe you guys are.

276
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,940
You should.

277
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,259
Try it out and let me know how it works.

278
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,080
Yeah you can tell us all about it on our website EnglishPod.com.

279
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,620
Yeah and we're definitely there to answer all your questions and I'll be posting the recipe as well on the website.

280
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,220
Alright well we're out of time for today but thanks for listening and until next time.

281
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,559
Bye.
