00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We are here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I am joined with Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my partner in crime, Marco.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So today we're going to be talking about a really great topic, one of my favorites.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Beer.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Beer.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So beer is a very popular drink, especially in bars and when you go out.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's very common with students, I think.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And it's also not very strong like vodka or whiskey.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
OK.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we are going to be at a bar today and we're going to be looking at some of this vocabulary that you would find.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I mean, you've got to know this beer vocabulary.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
OK.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at these words.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey, man, what do you have on top?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Heineken and Budweiser.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We have a two for one happy hour special.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Cool.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
OK.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Pint of Heineken, half a pint of Bud for table six.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What about some appetizers?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sure.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
OK.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That'll be 80 bucks.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What?

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, it's pretty expensive for two beers and some food.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, it happens sometimes you go to these very exclusive bars and they charge you like if it was gold.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I mean, that's crazy.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, let's take a look at some of these great words that we saw in language takeaway.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Language takeaway.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Our first word is on tap.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
On tap.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
On tap.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So he asked, what do you have on tap?

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Now, this is a strange sentence.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What exactly does it mean?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
OK, well, he's asking about what beers the bar has.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But not in a bottle or not in a can.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, you know, in a bar, there's often this machine.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That that will pour very fresh beer right directly into the glass, into the glass.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is a very popular thing because, like you say, it's fresh beer.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It tastes better.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tastes better.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
OK.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So what do you have on tap?

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What do you have on tap?

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's take a look at our second word.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Happy hour.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Happy hour.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Happy hour.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Happy hour.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now, this is very common and popular with bars.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is it when they have a happy hour?

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
OK.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
A happy hour is a period of time where the drinks are very cheap.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OK.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So happy hour could be from 5 p.m.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
till 10 p.m.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
50 percent off.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So if the drink is four dollars, then it is now two dollars in happy hour.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Perfect.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And this brings us to our third word.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A special.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A special.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A special.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A special.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So this is a noun.

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And what does it mean when a restaurant or a bar has a special?

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's like they're having a sale.

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A sale.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So things are cheaper.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it could be, for example, a Monday night special.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Or like in the dialog, a happy hour special.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
OK.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So it is a promotion.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All right.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Very good.

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And now they ordered a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Budweiser.

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mm hmm.

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Pint.

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a very, very special beer word.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So a pint is the size of your glass.

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
OK.

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So we understand how much a pint is.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, how what is what would be the equivalent in liters?

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A pint is zero point four liters.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
OK.

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So almost half a liter is one pint.

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
OK.

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It is very common when you go into a bar, you can order a pint of beer.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, exactly.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In English, we don't say I'll have half a liter of beer.

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So let's take a look at our next word on language takeaway.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Appetizers.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Appetizers.

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Appetizers.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Appetizers.

120
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OK.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So what is an appetizer?

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, it is food you eat before your dinner.

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Or before your lunch.

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OK.

125
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So it's usually maybe like a salad.

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Or a soup.

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or something small that you can eat right before your big meal.

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
OK.

129
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So some common appetizers at a bar and we saw them in our dialogue.

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Nachos and mozzarella sticks.

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Nachos.

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nachos.

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Nachos.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Nachos.

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So nachos are little chips, right?

136
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

137
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Corn chips.

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And it has cheese and maybe some tomatoes and maybe some beans.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
OK.

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So those are nachos.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
They're very common in the United States.

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And what about mozzarella sticks?

144
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mozzarella sticks.

145
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A travesty on the world and humanity and everyone's arteries.

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, mozzarella is a cheese, right?

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Mozzarella cheese.

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And this cheese, how is it prepared?

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You put it in some bread crumbs and then you fry it in oil.

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You deep fry it.

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And you don't like this?

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, this is terrible.

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why?

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They're so good.

155
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh my God.

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because then you can dip it in a little sauce and it's delicious.

157
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Marco, there are so many reasons why this is wrong.

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
All right.

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Well, mozzarella sticks, a very popular bar food.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All right.

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be able to hear these words in context at a slower speed.

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey man, what do you have on top?

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Heineken and Budweiser.

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We have a two for one happy hour special.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Cool.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Pint of Heineken, half a pint of Bud for table six.

169
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What about some appetizers?

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sure.

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

173
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That'll be 80 bucks.

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What?

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

176
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So we saw some really good vocabulary words there.

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And now let's take a look at putting it together.

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Putting it together.

179
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, in this lesson, we are going to look at one phrase that sometimes causes problems.

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So let's listen to this phrase that we're talking about.

181
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What about some appetizers?

182
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What about some appetizers?

183
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So this phrase, what about?

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah.

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I often hear people use it to ask a question.

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So a common mistake is asking, what about your weekend?

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What about your new job?

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Now, this is incorrect, right?

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You cannot use the phrase what about to ask a question about information.

191
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So you cannot ask for information.

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Because in our dialogue, the bartender said, and what about some appetizers?

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right.

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because he is making a suggestion.

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So he's saying, well, why don't you have some food?

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The phrase what about can be used to make a suggestion.

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

201
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I can say, what about going to the movies?

202
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You know what?

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's hear a few more examples of this because I think it's really useful.

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Example one.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What about these dirty clothes?

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You said you would wash them days ago.

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Example two.

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What about going to the mall instead?

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm tired of going to the movies.

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Example three.

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What about a pizza instead of noodles?

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All right.

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So really good examples and the same thing we can apply to how about.

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Exactly.

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So again, how about cannot ask for information.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So you can't say how about your boss.

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
All right.

219
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Perfect.

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay.

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about bars and beers.

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey man, what do you have on top?

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Heineken and Budweiser.

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We have a two for one happy hour special.

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Cool.

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Pint of Heineken, half a pint of Bud for table six.

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What about some appetizers?

230
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sure.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's have some nachos and mozzarella sticks.

232
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That'll be 80 bucks.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What?

235
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well Marco, I know you're a big fan of beer and actually I think everyone here at Praxis is a big beer drinker.

236
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And this is the perfect opportunity to tell everyone about the world renowned beer shake.

237
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh my God.

238
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay Marco.

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So everyone that listens to this recipe is a non-believer.

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
They say that it is not possible for it to taste good.

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But here's the recipe.

244
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You take a liter of beer or maybe half a liter.

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So a pint?

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A pint or a pint and a half.

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And you put it in the blender.

248
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
All right.

249
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now you take two eggs.

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Uh huh.

251
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay.

252
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Not cooked, not boiled, anything.

253
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You take two eggs and put them in the blender.

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It could be one or two.

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

256
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And then you take about half a cup of sugar.

257
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Put it in the blender.

258
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And you mix all that together and you get this really good foamy delicious beer shake.

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So a beer milkshake.

260
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well it has no milk.

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

262
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But it's actually really good.

263
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I've prepared it for some people and they're like no that's not possible it can't taste good.

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And in the end they're like wow this is actually pretty good.

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So did you invent this recipe?

266
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's actually really common in Ecuador, in Peru.

267
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've even seen it in Chile.

268
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Usually with a dark beer.

269
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Right.

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So like a Guinness or?

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It could be a Guinness or yeah.

272
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If it's that, a dark beer is a little bit sweeter so you wouldn't add so much sugar.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
But if you have another beer like a lager or a stout you could still do it but just add a little bit more sugar because that beer is a little bit more bitter.

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay.

275
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well I am not going to try this recipe but maybe you guys are.

276
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You should.

277
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Try it out and let me know how it works.

278
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah you can tell us all about it on our website EnglishPod.com.

279
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah and we're definitely there to answer all your questions and I'll be posting the recipe as well on the website.

280
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Alright well we're out of time for today but thanks for listening and until next time.

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Bye.
