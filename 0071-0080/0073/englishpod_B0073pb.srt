00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,459
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,679
And today we're at a wedding ceremony.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,119
Alright, nice!

6
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,439
Another nice wedding.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,199
But of course it wouldn't be EnglishPod unless we have something unexpected happening at this wedding.

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,239
Okay, so we're going to be talking about hands.

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,940
But Marco, what is there to say about a hand?

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,239
Well, as you may or may not know, each finger has a name on your hand.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:28,899
Okay.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,700
So we're going to learn how, so we're going to learn what those names are in English.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,280
Perfect.

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,020
And also we're going to learn about some common phrases that you might hear in an English wedding.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,539
Exactly, because I think, exactly because usually it's old English.

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,259
Maybe English that's not used anymore.

17
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,740
Alright, well I'm excited to find out what this unexpected event is.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,899
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

19
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,540
Here it is a symbol of our love and commitment.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,700
Honey, that's my pinky.

21
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,000
That ring goes on the ring finger.

22
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,799
This one?

23
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:39,379
That's my index finger.

24
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,280
Oh right, this one right?

25
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,420
That's the thumb nick.

26
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,819
Okay, I got it.

27
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,599
This is the ring finger.

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,599
That's my middle finger nick.

29
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,599
This is my ring finger.

30
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,979
Alright, embarrassing moments for the groom.

31
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:09,620
Yes.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,419
Confusing the fingers in front of all his friends and family.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,659
Not good.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,719
So I mentioned before that we're going to learn the names of each finger in your hand, so let's get started.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,120
Let's take a look at these in Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,120
Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:31,039
Alright, well why don't we start with the smallest finger on your hand.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,759
The smallest finger on your hand.

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,939
That's called the pinky.

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,340
Pinky.

41
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,979
Sometimes people call it the little finger.

42
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:38,340
Yes.

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:38,800
Right?

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,199
Yep.

45
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,699
So, the pinky.

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,400
And the next finger is the one the groom couldn't find.

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,400
Okay, the ring finger.

48
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,819
The ring finger.

49
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,039
So this is, of course, like the name says, where the wedding ring is usually placed.

50
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:54,539
Exactly.

51
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,020
On his finger.

52
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:55,419
Yep.

53
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,039
Now the next one is a controversial finger.

54
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,680
That must be the middle finger.

55
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,599
Okay, easy.

56
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:02,639
Middle finger.

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,219
So why is it controversial?

58
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,539
Well, you know, if you put your middle finger up, and you put all...

59
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,860
Like you're doing right now to me?

60
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Yes.

61
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,919
I'm sorry Marco, I'll do it this way.

62
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:19,000
And all other fingers down, you are making a very rude gesture.

63
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,240
A rude sign.

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,780
So what would you call that?

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,020
I would call that giving the middle finger.

66
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,340
Giving the middle finger.

67
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,340
Or, I've also heard the phrase flip someone off.

68
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,659
Yes.

69
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,840
Or also flip the bird.

70
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,300
Flip the bird, exactly.

71
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:34,860
Or give him the bird.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,280
Yes.

73
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,180
So all phrases that you can use when you are showing only your middle finger to somebody.

74
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,199
It's not very polite.

75
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,000
No, don't do it.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,599
Don't do it.

77
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
Unless somebody deserves it, I guess.

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,340
Well, we won't talk about that, but what we will talk about is the next finger.

79
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,199
The index finger.

80
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:53,979
The index finger.

81
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,219
Index finger.

82
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,580
So this is the finger you use to point.

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,039
Right.

84
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,520
The index finger.

85
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,699
Any idea why they call it the index finger?

86
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:06,419
Because when you're looking through the index of a book, you always use this finger.

87
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Right.

88
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:10,879
I think you also use this finger to pass pages on a book, right?

89
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,280
Yeah.

90
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,360
Okay, don't believe anything I just told you.

91
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,919
Well, we're not sure.

92
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,920
Maybe you guys know the real answer to this.

93
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Alright.

94
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,860
And our last finger, the most important one.

95
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:20,899
The thumb.

96
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:21,720
Thumb.

97
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,360
T-H-U-M-B.

98
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,360
The thumb.

99
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,160
Thumb.

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,920
Okay, so that's the short but fat finger.

101
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,439
The very movable one.

102
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,319
The movable one.

103
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,379
The one that you use to play PlayStation.

104
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,279
Video games.

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:34,639
Yeah.

106
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,500
Okay, so the pronunciation here.

107
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,959
Do you say the B at the end of this word?

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,360
No, I actually only pronounce the M.

109
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:41,759
Yes.

110
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,860
The thumb.

111
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:44,639
Yeah, you wouldn't say the thumb.

112
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:45,240
No.

113
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:56,420
Okay, so now that we're clear on all five fingers, let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk about these difficult phrases that the priest used.

114
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,500
The rings please.

115
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,240
May this ring be blessed.

116
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:13,459
So he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and continue in love until life's end.

117
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:20,300
With this ring, I be wed, wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

118
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,439
Honey, that's my pinky.

119
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,819
That ring goes on the ring finger.

120
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,620
This one?

121
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,220
That's my index finger.

122
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,240
Oh, right.

123
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,100
This one, right?

124
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,199
That's the thumb, Nick.

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,439
Okay, I got it.

126
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:40,319
This is the ring finger.

127
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,319
That's my middle finger, Nick.

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,180
This is my ring finger.

129
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,240
Well, this is really common wedding speak, isn't it?

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Yeah, it's really common.

131
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,620
That's what usually the priest or the person who is marrying somebody would say.

132
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:04,240
Well, why don't we look at some of these phrases now, because it's really interesting to talk about their meaning.

133
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,500
So the first one, may this ring be blessed.

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,120
May this ring be blessed.

135
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,579
May this ring be blessed.

136
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:15,819
So what does it mean when you bless something or someone?

137
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:19,980
Well, usually the religious leader does this, right?

138
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,100
And he's giving good wishes to that thing.

139
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,779
Could be for an object or to a person, right?

140
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,100
You can be blessed as well.

141
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,800
And so these good wishes usually come from God.

142
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,560
Okay, great.

143
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:35,040
So what about our next phrase?

144
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,120
Abide in peace.

145
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,000
Abide in peace.

146
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
Abide in peace.

147
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,399
Wow, so this verb abide.

148
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,139
It means to live.

149
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,240
To live.

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,939
To be.

151
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,100
To be in peace.

152
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,060
But it's very fancy and I don't know if you use it anymore.

153
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,540
No, I think you would never use this word in conversation or even very rarely in writing.

154
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,959
It's quite old.

155
00:06:59,339 --> 00:06:59,779
Yes, definitely.

156
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:00,439
I would agree.

157
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,120
So abide in peace.

158
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,259
Okay, what about our next phrase?

159
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,819
I like this and it's the common phrase you'll hear in all movies and in all marriages.

160
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:09,319
Yep.

161
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,839
With this ring I the wed.

162
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,680
With this ring I the wed.

163
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,360
With this ring I the wed.

164
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,699
Okay, we've got two words in here that are also older English words.

165
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,139
So the.

166
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,699
The.

167
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,720
T-H-E-E.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,279
T-H-E-E.

169
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,959
The.

170
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,480
So this is a middle English term for you.

171
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,579
You, right?

172
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,420
So can I say I love thee?

173
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,100
You could, that would be very romantic but also inappropriate for the office.

174
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,540
But it's very old English.

175
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,040
I guess if you're reading Shakespeare you would definitely come upon this, right?

176
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,560
Yes, yes.

177
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,019
And what about wed?

178
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,160
This is also an old verb for the action of marrying someone.

179
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,680
So I can say we will be wed next year.

180
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,000
But don't say that now because you'll sound quite silly.

181
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:02,920
Yeah.

182
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,220
It's too old-fashioned.

183
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,399
Yeah, I guess so.

184
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,899
But it's good to know, especially if you guys are reading something a little bit more classical.

185
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,579
Or you plan to get married to an English person.

186
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,680
All right, and our last phrase.

187
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,259
Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

188
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,920
Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

189
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,079
So now he's referring to the rings, right?

190
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,920
Wear the ring.

191
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,319
Yep.

192
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,399
As a symbol.

193
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,579
A sign.

194
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,720
A representation.

195
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,259
Yes.

196
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,019
Of love and commitment.

197
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,059
So why would you wear a ring as a symbol of something?

198
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Well obviously, you know, love, you can't see it, you can't touch it.

199
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,720
Right.

200
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,320
So you need something to show you that it's there.

201
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,379
So you need a sign of that love.

202
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,440
Something that you can see.

203
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,840
So that's what the ring represents.

204
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:45,179
Yeah.

205
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,419
But how about this word commitment?

206
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,519
A commitment is a strong promise.

207
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,159
So you promise to love that person, to take care of them.

208
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:53,399
Yes.

209
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,679
Okay, great.

210
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:00,519
So now we are a little bit more familiar with some of the language you hear in a wedding ceremony.

211
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,299
And we also know all of the names of the fingers.

212
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:03,860
Exactly.

213
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,580
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to hear these all in context.

214
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,399
The rings, please.

215
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:34,379
May this ring be blessed, so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and continue in love until life's end.

216
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:41,240
With this ring I be wed, wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

217
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,480
Honey, that's my pinky.

218
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,740
That ring goes on the ring finger.

219
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:52,519
This one?

220
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,139
That's my index finger.

221
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:56,159
Oh, right.

222
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,000
This one, right?

223
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:01,100
That's the thumb, Nick.

224
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Okay, I got it.

225
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,340
This is the ring finger.

226
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,340
That's my middle finger, Nick.

227
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:09,139
This is my ring finger.

228
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,980
All right, so now it's perfectly clear and a romantic dialogue in the end.

229
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,860
Yeah, very romantic.

230
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,740
Although a little bit embarrassing.

231
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,080
Yeah.

232
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,000
So what about wedding rings?

233
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,919
Now we have different types of rings, right?

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,899
We have the wedding ring, the one that we just heard.

235
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah.

236
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,179
But we also have an engagement ring.

237
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:37,639
Yes.

238
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,139
Yeah.

239
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:43,960
In most English speaking countries, the woman is very, very lucky because she gets two rings, right?

240
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,679
So when the man asks her to marry him, he gives her a diamond, a diamond ring.

241
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,840
That is usually that's the engagement ring.

242
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,820
And it's really, really important that he does this.

243
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,120
And it's also really important that he spends a lot of money on the diamond.

244
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,419
I know about this.

245
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,419
Diamonds are forever.

246
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:02,799
Yes.

247
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,039
And the tradition is you must spend at least one month's salary.

248
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:07,639
Wow.

249
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:07,940
Yeah.

250
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:08,500
Is that it?

251
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:08,759
Yeah.

252
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,899
So the girl gets a diamond engagement ring.

253
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,820
And then on wedding day, she gets the wedding ring.

254
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,200
Yes.

255
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,639
And usually, will she wear both of them?

256
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,120
Yeah, she'll always wear both of them.

257
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,340
So the engagement ring goes closest to you and then the wedding ring on top.

258
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,360
And the engagement ring, it represents the commitment to marry her.

259
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:32,480
So wait, the commitment from the man to marry her.

260
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,799
Okay, so that it's a symbol that they will get married.

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,179
Yes, it's a symbol of the promise.

262
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,440
Now, what happens if they break up and they don't get married?

263
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:41,639
Does he get the ring back?

264
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,659
I don't know.

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
Okay, here's the rule.

266
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,159
If he was a jerk, no.

267
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,480
But if it was sort of like a happy breakup, then okay.

268
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,100
Okay.

269
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,820
I guess it's a big risk, right?

270
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,220
Yeah.

271
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:57,539
All right.

272
00:11:57,659 --> 00:11:59,299
So that's all for today, guys.

273
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,039
Let us know if you guys have any interesting wedding stories.

274
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,460
I know that sometimes weddings can be embarrassing.

275
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,240
People, I don't know, objecting.

276
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,860
Maybe I've seen the groom faint or even fall in a pool.

277
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,860
So if you have any stories, please share them with us.

278
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,259
Come to EnglishPod.com.

279
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,379
