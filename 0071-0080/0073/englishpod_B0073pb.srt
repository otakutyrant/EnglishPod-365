00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're at a wedding ceremony.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Alright, nice!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Another nice wedding.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
But of course it wouldn't be EnglishPod unless we have something unexpected happening at this wedding.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so we're going to be talking about hands.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But Marco, what is there to say about a hand?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, as you may or may not know, each finger has a name on your hand.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we're going to learn how, so we're going to learn what those names are in English.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Perfect.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And also we're going to learn about some common phrases that you might hear in an English wedding.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Exactly, because I think, exactly because usually it's old English.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Maybe English that's not used anymore.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Alright, well I'm excited to find out what this unexpected event is.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Here it is a symbol of our love and commitment.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Honey, that's my pinky.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That ring goes on the ring finger.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This one?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's my index finger.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh right, this one right?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's the thumb nick.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, I got it.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is the ring finger.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's my middle finger nick.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is my ring finger.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright, embarrassing moments for the groom.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Confusing the fingers in front of all his friends and family.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Not good.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So I mentioned before that we're going to learn the names of each finger in your hand, so let's get started.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's take a look at these in Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Alright, well why don't we start with the smallest finger on your hand.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The smallest finger on your hand.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's called the pinky.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Pinky.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Sometimes people call it the little finger.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Right?

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yep.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, the pinky.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And the next finger is the one the groom couldn't find.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, the ring finger.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The ring finger.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So this is, of course, like the name says, where the wedding ring is usually placed.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Exactly.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
On his finger.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yep.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now the next one is a controversial finger.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That must be the middle finger.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, easy.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Middle finger.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So why is it controversial?

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, you know, if you put your middle finger up, and you put all...

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Like you're doing right now to me?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry Marco, I'll do it this way.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And all other fingers down, you are making a very rude gesture.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A rude sign.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So what would you call that?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I would call that giving the middle finger.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Giving the middle finger.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Or, I've also heard the phrase flip someone off.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or also flip the bird.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Flip the bird, exactly.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or give him the bird.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So all phrases that you can use when you are showing only your middle finger to somebody.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not very polite.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, don't do it.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't do it.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Unless somebody deserves it, I guess.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, we won't talk about that, but what we will talk about is the next finger.

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The index finger.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The index finger.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Index finger.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So this is the finger you use to point.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Right.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The index finger.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Any idea why they call it the index finger?

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Because when you're looking through the index of a book, you always use this finger.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think you also use this finger to pass pages on a book, right?

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, don't believe anything I just told you.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, we're not sure.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Maybe you guys know the real answer to this.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And our last finger, the most important one.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The thumb.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thumb.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
T-H-U-M-B.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The thumb.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thumb.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, so that's the short but fat finger.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The very movable one.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The movable one.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The one that you use to play PlayStation.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Video games.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay, so the pronunciation here.

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you say the B at the end of this word?

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, I actually only pronounce the M.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The thumb.

111
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, you wouldn't say the thumb.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, so now that we're clear on all five fingers, let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk about these difficult phrases that the priest used.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The rings please.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
May this ring be blessed.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and continue in love until life's end.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
With this ring, I be wed, wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Honey, that's my pinky.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That ring goes on the ring finger.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This one?

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's my index finger.

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, right.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This one, right?

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's the thumb, Nick.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, I got it.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is the ring finger.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's my middle finger, Nick.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is my ring finger.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, this is really common wedding speak, isn't it?

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, it's really common.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's what usually the priest or the person who is marrying somebody would say.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, why don't we look at some of these phrases now, because it's really interesting to talk about their meaning.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So the first one, may this ring be blessed.

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
May this ring be blessed.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
May this ring be blessed.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So what does it mean when you bless something or someone?

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, usually the religious leader does this, right?

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And he's giving good wishes to that thing.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Could be for an object or to a person, right?

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can be blessed as well.

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And so these good wishes usually come from God.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, great.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So what about our next phrase?

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Abide in peace.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Abide in peace.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Abide in peace.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Wow, so this verb abide.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It means to live.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
To live.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
To be.

151
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
To be in peace.

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But it's very fancy and I don't know if you use it anymore.

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No, I think you would never use this word in conversation or even very rarely in writing.

154
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's quite old.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes, definitely.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I would agree.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So abide in peace.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay, what about our next phrase?

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I like this and it's the common phrase you'll hear in all movies and in all marriages.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yep.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
With this ring I the wed.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
With this ring I the wed.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
With this ring I the wed.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, we've got two words in here that are also older English words.

165
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So the.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
T-H-E-E.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
T-H-E-E.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So this is a middle English term for you.

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You, right?

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So can I say I love thee?

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You could, that would be very romantic but also inappropriate for the office.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But it's very old English.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I guess if you're reading Shakespeare you would definitely come upon this, right?

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes, yes.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And what about wed?

178
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is also an old verb for the action of marrying someone.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So I can say we will be wed next year.

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But don't say that now because you'll sound quite silly.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's too old-fashioned.

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, I guess so.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it's good to know, especially if you guys are reading something a little bit more classical.

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Or you plan to get married to an English person.

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
All right, and our last phrase.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So now he's referring to the rings, right?

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wear the ring.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yep.

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
As a symbol.

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
A sign.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
A representation.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of love and commitment.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So why would you wear a ring as a symbol of something?

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well obviously, you know, love, you can't see it, you can't touch it.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right.

200
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So you need something to show you that it's there.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you need a sign of that love.

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Something that you can see.

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So that's what the ring represents.

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But how about this word commitment?

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A commitment is a strong promise.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So you promise to love that person, to take care of them.

208
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

209
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, great.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So now we are a little bit more familiar with some of the language you hear in a wedding ceremony.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And we also know all of the names of the fingers.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Exactly.

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to hear these all in context.

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The rings, please.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:34,000
May this ring be blessed, so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace and continue in love until life's end.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
With this ring I be wed, wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment.

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Honey, that's my pinky.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That ring goes on the ring finger.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This one?

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's my index finger.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, right.

222
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This one, right?

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's the thumb, Nick.

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, I got it.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is the ring finger.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's my middle finger, Nick.

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This is my ring finger.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
All right, so now it's perfectly clear and a romantic dialogue in the end.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, very romantic.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Although a little bit embarrassing.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So what about wedding rings?

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now we have different types of rings, right?

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We have the wedding ring, the one that we just heard.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah.

236
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But we also have an engagement ring.

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
In most English speaking countries, the woman is very, very lucky because she gets two rings, right?

240
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So when the man asks her to marry him, he gives her a diamond, a diamond ring.

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That is usually that's the engagement ring.

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And it's really, really important that he does this.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And it's also really important that he spends a lot of money on the diamond.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I know about this.

245
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Diamonds are forever.

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And the tradition is you must spend at least one month's salary.

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Wow.

249
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah.

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is that it?

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah.

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So the girl gets a diamond engagement ring.

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then on wedding day, she gets the wedding ring.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes.

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And usually, will she wear both of them?

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, she'll always wear both of them.

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So the engagement ring goes closest to you and then the wedding ring on top.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And the engagement ring, it represents the commitment to marry her.

259
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So wait, the commitment from the man to marry her.

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay, so that it's a symbol that they will get married.

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, it's a symbol of the promise.

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Now, what happens if they break up and they don't get married?

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Does he get the ring back?

264
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know.

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay, here's the rule.

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If he was a jerk, no.

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But if it was sort of like a happy breakup, then okay.

268
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay.

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I guess it's a big risk, right?

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All right.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So that's all for today, guys.

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let us know if you guys have any interesting wedding stories.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I know that sometimes weddings can be embarrassing.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
People, I don't know, objecting.

276
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Maybe I've seen the groom faint or even fall in a pool.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So if you have any stories, please share them with us.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come to EnglishPod.com.

279
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
