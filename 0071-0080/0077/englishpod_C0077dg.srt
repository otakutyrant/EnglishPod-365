00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:10,619
Welcome back racing fans, my name is Rick Fields and as always I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,859
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

3
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,399
They're heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,519
It's a close one and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

5
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:27,219
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes and spun out.

6
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:30,219
We have yellow flag and the pace car is making its way into the track.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,119
The clean up crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,420
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

9
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,320
Smoke is coming out of his car.

10
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:44,280
He seems to be having engine trouble, he makes his way under the pit and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,880
How unlucky for Raikonen and this race is over ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,600
Alonso takes the checkered flag.
