00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're going to be in one of my favorite sporting events, which is F1 racing.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So yeah, we're going to be talking about racing, specifically F1, which is a very popular sport all over the world.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, I think maybe it's like number two in popularity after soccer.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, I think so.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I have no numbers to back that up though.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well they do travel everywhere, they have races all over the world, and just people love it.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, it is kind of a cool thing.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, going 300 kilometers per hour in a car is pretty cool.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Alright, so let's not delay this any longer, let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Welcome back racing fans, my name is Rick Fields, and as always I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They're heading to turn three, and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a close one, and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes, and spun out.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We have yellow flag, and the pace car is making its way into the track.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car, and the green flag drops.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Smoke is coming out of his car!

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He seems to be having engine trouble, he makes his way under the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead!

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How unlucky for Raikonen, and this race is over ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What an exciting race!

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I always love a good crash when it comes to car races.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think many people go to races expecting to see a crash.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They don't want to see people getting hurt.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, but a little bit of...

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The emotion of just car crashes and stuff.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, a little explosion here and there.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Alright.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So now we saw some really exciting language related to racing.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alright, so we were talking about that crash, and I think what led to the crash was the driver jammed on the brakes.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right, he jammed on the brakes.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
To jam on the brakes.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, now if I jam on the brakes...

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You push the brakes really really hard and really quickly and really suddenly.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right, so you jam on the brakes and you stop very quickly.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So Lewis Hamilton jammed on the brakes and consequently spun out.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
To spin out.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, in the present it would be spin out.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Spin out.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, so imagine yourselves driving your car on a very wet road.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then you jam on the brakes.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Right, so then the car, you kind of lose control of the car and it starts to spin.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It goes in circles.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That would be to spin out.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This has actually happened to me more than once.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Really?

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Were you okay?

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, I was fine, I was fine.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay, so the car spun out.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now in racing you always see this really cool car come out and be ahead of everyone when there's an accident.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Right, that's called the pace car.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The pace car.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Pace car.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now why is it called the pace car?

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Because it sets the pace.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, the pace or the speed.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So pace means speed.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So this car comes out and no other car can pass it.

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Everyone must go at the same speed.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right, the pace car.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Pace car.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Alright, so after there's an accident, the clean up crew must come out.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, clean up crew.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Clean up crew.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Alright, so crew, this is an interesting word.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When we talk about a crew, we talk about a group of people who work together.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, but for example in an office, can I have a crew?

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Not really.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Not commonly, right?

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, it's people who work together and they use their hands to work.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They do manual labor.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, so I can say for example a construction crew.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right, or maybe the ground crew at the airport.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, or the flight crew.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Also at the airport.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, in the airplane.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So that's a crew.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So clean up crew.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Clean up crew.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now they came out to take that car away, that broken or damaged vehicle, so they were towing it.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, the verb to tow.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
To tow.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So what does it mean when you tow something or you tow a car?

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You pull something behind you.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So if you're a truck, that might pull a car behind you.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's a tow truck.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
A tow truck.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now this happens commonly if you park your vehicle where you are not supposed to.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right, and your car will get towed.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Your car gets towed.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Very good.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Alright, so we saw five really great words related to racing, and now why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll look at some other interesting phrases.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Welcome back, race fans.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
My name is Rick Fields, and as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
They're heading to turn three, and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a close one, and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes, and spun out.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We have a yellow flag, and the pace car is making its way onto the track.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car, and the green flag drops.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Smoke is coming out of his car.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He seems to be having engine trouble.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He makes his way into the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How unlucky for Raikonen, and this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, so now we're back, and I think it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, even though we're talking about F1 racing, a lot of the language can be used in many different situations, so let's look at some of those phrases now.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
When Rick Fields introduced his co-host, he said, my partner in crime.

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Partner in crime.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Partner in crime.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now, it's not that they're actually committing a crime.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No, they're not actually bank robbers.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But it's a very common and friendly way of saying my good friend or my...

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The person I do everything with.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right, my coworker, for example, right?

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But a coworker who's a really, really good friend, who you spend a lot of time with.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, so that's your partner in crime.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just a metaphor, right?

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So, partner in crime.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, what about the next phrase?

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The last stretch.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The last stretch.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Last stretch.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay, before we explain this word, let's listen to some examples, and then we'll come back and talk about it.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Example one.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We are finally in the last stretch of a very long week.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't wait to go home.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Example two.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's in the last stretch of his college years, and soon he'll graduate.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, so I understand that to mean like the final length of time.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Right, the last or final moments before an ending.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All right, so the last stretch.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The last stretch.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now, when you're on the last stretch, you just have a few minutes to go.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
To go.

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, to go.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now, this preposition, too, and the verb go is very easy, right?

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But if you say five minutes to go, what does that mean?

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Five minutes left.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Left.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It doesn't mean it's five minutes to actually leave, right?

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, it means you must complete five minutes before you can be finished.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So, it's not about exiting.

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have five days to go before I go on vacation.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So, it's not about you actually going on the vacation.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's about you passing those five days.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Can you give us another example?

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How about we have 45 minutes to go before the end of the day?

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's right.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So, to go.

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Left.

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Exactly, to go.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
All right, now let's take a look at our last phrase.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Close one.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
A close one.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
A close one.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All right, another interesting phrase made up of simple words.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So, let's listen to some examples to help us understand it.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Example one.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That was a close one.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The teacher almost caught me cheating.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Example two.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a close one.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We are tied and the game is almost over.

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Example three.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My girlfriend almost found the presents I hid under the bed.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was a close one.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, a close one.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
A situation that is almost dangerous, but wasn't.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But wasn't, exactly.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That was a close one.

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, so very good phrases.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I think we can take a lot from this and apply it outside of F1, right?

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

190
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk about this great sport.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Welcome back, racing fans.

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
My name is Rick Fields, and as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They're heading to turn three, and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a close one, and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes, and spun out.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We have yellow flag, and the pace car is making its way into the track.

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car, and the green flag drops.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Smoke is coming out of his car!

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He seems to be having engine trouble.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He makes his way under the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead!

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How unlucky for Raikonen, and this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
All right, so F1 racing.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Erika, do you like it?

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you watch it?

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, F1's pretty neat.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Cars that drive fast, that's pretty interesting.

210
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, for some people it isn't, right?

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why do I want to go to a race and just see fast cars?

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I would never go to a race, but I think I would maybe watch the highlights on TV.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, actually this year it's really exciting because, again, we're gonna have a night race.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think it's in Malaysia or somewhere in Asia, that they're gonna race at night.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, so that's pretty special, huh?

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, it's like harder to see and you're going really fast, imagine.

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
All right, so I hear you're going to the F1 this year.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes, this year I'm gonna go to the Shanghai circuit to watch the F1 race, so I'm really excited about that.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I haven't ever been to one, so it should be fun.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
All right, well I hope you get to see some interesting things like car crashes and pace cars.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What about you guys, our listeners?

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you fans of F1?

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Have you ever been to an F1 race?

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Exactly, send us your questions and comments and also your stories.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I think we have listeners from all over the world.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We have a lot of listeners in Brazil and I know that there is a Grand Prix there, so tell us how did it go?

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you like it?

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can visit us at EnglishPod.com, where Marco and I are around to answer your questions.

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
All right, any Canadian race car drivers?

230
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, yeah, there was one recently.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Someone, some something.

232
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All right, maybe our users know which one is the Canadian.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So we'll see you guys there.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thanks for listening.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Bye.
