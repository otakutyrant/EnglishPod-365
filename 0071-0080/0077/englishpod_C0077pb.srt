00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:06,620
Hello everyone, welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,339
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,240
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:14,640
And today we're going to be in one of my favorite sporting events, which is F1 racing.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,739
So yeah, we're going to be talking about racing, specifically F1, which is a very popular sport all over the world.

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
Yeah, I think maybe it's like number two in popularity after soccer.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,300
Yeah, I think so.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,120
I have no numbers to back that up though.

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,659
Well they do travel everywhere, they have races all over the world, and just people love it.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,179
Well, it is kind of a cool thing.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,240
Well, going 300 kilometers per hour in a car is pretty cool.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,719
Alright, so let's not delay this any longer, let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

13
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,020
Welcome back racing fans, my name is Rick Fields, and as always I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

14
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:07,379
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

15
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,920
They're heading to turn three, and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

16
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,060
It's a close one, and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,719
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes, and spun out.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,700
We have yellow flag, and the pace car is making its way into the track.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,620
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car, and the green flag drops.

20
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,939
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,840
Smoke is coming out of his car!

22
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,819
He seems to be having engine trouble, he makes his way under the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead!

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,379
How unlucky for Raikonen, and this race is over ladies and gentlemen.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,120
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

25
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,879
What an exciting race!

26
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,939
I always love a good crash when it comes to car races.

27
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,200
I think many people go to races expecting to see a crash.

28
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,420
They don't want to see people getting hurt.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,739
No, but a little bit of...

30
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,219
The emotion of just car crashes and stuff.

31
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,139
Yeah, a little explosion here and there.

32
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,099
Alright.

33
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,900
So now we saw some really exciting language related to racing.

34
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,879
So why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,240
Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:30,159
Alright, so we were talking about that crash, and I think what led to the crash was the driver jammed on the brakes.

37
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,199
Right, he jammed on the brakes.

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,000
To jam on the brakes.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,360
Okay, now if I jam on the brakes...

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,020
You push the brakes really really hard and really quickly and really suddenly.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,379
Right, so you jam on the brakes and you stop very quickly.

42
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:52,060
So Lewis Hamilton jammed on the brakes and consequently spun out.

43
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,860
To spin out.

44
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,979
Okay, in the present it would be spin out.

45
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,379
Spin out.

46
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,860
Okay, so imagine yourselves driving your car on a very wet road.

47
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,960
And then you jam on the brakes.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,860
Right, so then the car, you kind of lose control of the car and it starts to spin.

49
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,819
It goes in circles.

50
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,080
That would be to spin out.

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,860
This has actually happened to me more than once.

52
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:18,300
Really?

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:18,719
Yeah.

54
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:19,719
Were you okay?

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,439
Yeah, I was fine, I was fine.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,979
Okay, so the car spun out.

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,580
Now in racing you always see this really cool car come out and be ahead of everyone when there's an accident.

58
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,599
Right, that's called the pace car.

59
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,939
The pace car.

60
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:35,719
Pace car.

61
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,500
Now why is it called the pace car?

62
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,599
Because it sets the pace.

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,340
Okay, the pace or the speed.

64
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,800
So pace means speed.

65
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,000
So this car comes out and no other car can pass it.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,900
Everyone must go at the same speed.

67
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,020
Right, the pace car.

68
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:50,680
Pace car.

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,979
Alright, so after there's an accident, the clean up crew must come out.

70
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,620
Okay, clean up crew.

71
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,539
Clean up crew.

72
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,860
Alright, so crew, this is an interesting word.

73
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,699
When we talk about a crew, we talk about a group of people who work together.

74
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,599
Okay, but for example in an office, can I have a crew?

75
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,620
Not really.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,800
Not commonly, right?

77
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,139
Yeah, it's people who work together and they use their hands to work.

78
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,399
They do manual labor.

79
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,519
Okay, so I can say for example a construction crew.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,620
That's right, or maybe the ground crew at the airport.

81
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:25,879
Okay, or the flight crew.

82
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:26,899
Also at the airport.

83
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,339
Alright.

84
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,199
Well, in the airplane.

85
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,480
So that's a crew.

86
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:31,899
So clean up crew.

87
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:32,699
Clean up crew.

88
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,620
Now they came out to take that car away, that broken or damaged vehicle, so they were towing it.

89
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,540
Okay, the verb to tow.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,540
To tow.

91
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,240
So what does it mean when you tow something or you tow a car?

92
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,459
You pull something behind you.

93
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,500
So if you're a truck, that might pull a car behind you.

94
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,439
That's a tow truck.

95
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,319
A tow truck.

96
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,959
Now this happens commonly if you park your vehicle where you are not supposed to.

97
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,639
That's right, and your car will get towed.

98
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:04,720
Your car gets towed.

99
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:05,519
Very good.

100
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:16,480
Alright, so we saw five really great words related to racing, and now why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll look at some other interesting phrases.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,220
Welcome back, race fans.

102
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:33,339
My name is Rick Fields, and as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

103
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,339
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

104
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,579
They're heading to turn three, and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

105
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,699
It's a close one, and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

106
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,060
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes, and spun out.

107
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,240
We have a yellow flag, and the pace car is making its way onto the track.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,860
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car, and the green flag drops.

109
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,399
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

110
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:11,019
Smoke is coming out of his car.

111
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,899
He seems to be having engine trouble.

112
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:19,519
He makes his way into the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead.

113
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,459
How unlucky for Raikonen, and this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

114
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:26,620
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

115
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:35,259
Okay, so now we're back, and I think it's time for us to take a look at some phrases in Fluency Builder.

116
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,259
Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:46,399
Well, even though we're talking about F1 racing, a lot of the language can be used in many different situations, so let's look at some of those phrases now.

118
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:53,519
When Rick Fields introduced his co-host, he said, my partner in crime.

119
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,100
Partner in crime.

120
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,139
Partner in crime.

121
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,420
Now, it's not that they're actually committing a crime.

122
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,160
No, they're not actually bank robbers.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,959
But it's a very common and friendly way of saying my good friend or my...

124
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,459
The person I do everything with.

125
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,420
Right, my coworker, for example, right?

126
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,019
But a coworker who's a really, really good friend, who you spend a lot of time with.

127
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,060
Okay, so that's your partner in crime.

128
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just a metaphor, right?

129
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,600
So, partner in crime.

130
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,759
Now, what about the next phrase?

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,839
The last stretch.

132
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,899
The last stretch.

133
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,060
Last stretch.

134
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,600
Okay, before we explain this word, let's listen to some examples, and then we'll come back and talk about it.

135
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,300
Example one.

136
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,259
We are finally in the last stretch of a very long week.

137
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,800
I can't wait to go home.

138
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,079
Example two.

139
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:49,420
He's in the last stretch of his college years, and soon he'll graduate.

140
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay, so I understand that to mean like the final length of time.

141
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,399
Right, the last or final moments before an ending.

142
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,399
All right, so the last stretch.

143
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
The last stretch.

144
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,639
Now, when you're on the last stretch, you just have a few minutes to go.

145
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,639
To go.

146
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,839
Yeah, to go.

147
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,040
Now, this preposition, too, and the verb go is very easy, right?

148
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,420
Right.

149
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,959
But if you say five minutes to go, what does that mean?

150
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,339
Five minutes left.

151
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:19,899
Left.

152
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,899
It doesn't mean it's five minutes to actually leave, right?

153
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:23,240
Right.

154
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,259
No, it means you must complete five minutes before you can be finished.

155
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:27,720
Okay.

156
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,399
So, it's not about exiting.

157
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:29,959
Right.

158
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,899
I have five days to go before I go on vacation.

159
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,879
So, it's not about you actually going on the vacation.

160
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,399
It's about you passing those five days.

161
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,120
Can you give us another example?

162
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,539
How about we have 45 minutes to go before the end of the day?

163
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,000
That's right.

164
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,340
So, to go.

165
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:49,379
Left.

166
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,879
Exactly, to go.

167
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,480
All right, now let's take a look at our last phrase.

168
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,200
Close one.

169
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:57,539
A close one.

170
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,659
A close one.

171
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,080
All right, another interesting phrase made up of simple words.

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,919
So, let's listen to some examples to help us understand it.

173
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,879
Example one.

174
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,759
That was a close one.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,279
The teacher almost caught me cheating.

176
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,080
Example two.

177
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:18,159
It's a close one.

178
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,220
We are tied and the game is almost over.

179
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,580
Example three.

180
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,419
My girlfriend almost found the presents I hid under the bed.

181
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:29,500
It was a close one.

182
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,740
Okay.

183
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,879
So, a close one.

184
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,320
A situation that is almost dangerous, but wasn't.

185
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,620
But wasn't, exactly.

186
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:40,860
That was a close one.

187
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,820
Okay, so very good phrases.

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,259
I think we can take a lot from this and apply it outside of F1, right?

189
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:48,679
Yeah.

190
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,559
All right, so let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk about this great sport.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,539
Welcome back, racing fans.

192
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,360
My name is Rick Fields, and as always, I'm joined by my partner in crime, Bob Copeland.

193
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,700
We're in the last stretch of this very exciting race, and Kimi Raikonen is leading the pack with only four laps to go.

194
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,240
They're heading to turn three, and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Raikonen.

195
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,379
It's a close one, and oh no, Hamilton hits the wall.

196
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,059
He came in too fast, jammed on the brakes, and spun out.

197
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:28,039
We have yellow flag, and the pace car is making its way into the track.

198
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,940
The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car, and the green flag drops.

199
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:35,279
Raikonen is still in the lead with only two laps to go.

200
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,159
Smoke is coming out of his car!

201
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,679
He seems to be having engine trouble.

202
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,179
He makes his way under the pit, and Fernando Alonso takes the lead!

203
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,720
How unlucky for Raikonen, and this race is over, ladies and gentlemen.

204
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,500
Alonso takes the checkered flag.

205
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
All right, so F1 racing.

206
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,419
Erika, do you like it?

207
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,120
Do you watch it?

208
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, F1's pretty neat.

209
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,399
Cars that drive fast, that's pretty interesting.

210
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:12,639
Well, for some people it isn't, right?

211
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,299
Why do I want to go to a race and just see fast cars?

212
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:21,379
I would never go to a race, but I think I would maybe watch the highlights on TV.

213
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,580
Well, actually this year it's really exciting because, again, we're gonna have a night race.

214
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,440
I think it's in Malaysia or somewhere in Asia, that they're gonna race at night.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
Oh, so that's pretty special, huh?

216
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,799
Well, it's like harder to see and you're going really fast, imagine.

217
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,340
All right, so I hear you're going to the F1 this year.

218
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,299
Yes, this year I'm gonna go to the Shanghai circuit to watch the F1 race, so I'm really excited about that.

219
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,600
I haven't ever been to one, so it should be fun.

220
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,360
All right, well I hope you get to see some interesting things like car crashes and pace cars.

221
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,100
What about you guys, our listeners?

222
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,960
Are you fans of F1?

223
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,899
Have you ever been to an F1 race?

224
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,139
Exactly, send us your questions and comments and also your stories.

225
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,740
I think we have listeners from all over the world.

226
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:10,279
We have a lot of listeners in Brazil and I know that there is a Grand Prix there, so tell us how did it go?

227
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you like it?

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,440
You can visit us at EnglishPod.com, where Marco and I are around to answer your questions.

229
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,679
All right, any Canadian race car drivers?

230
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,879
Oh, yeah, there was one recently.

231
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,460
Someone, some something.

232
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,000
All right, maybe our users know which one is the Canadian.

233
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,700
So we'll see you guys there.

234
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,480
Thanks for listening.

235
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,960
Bye.
