00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're going to go back to the movies, but this time we're going to do it a little bit different.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're going to be listening as two movie critics offer their opinion on the latest release.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All right.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we're going to be learning how to criticize or give your opinions about something.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And here we're talking movies, but a lot of this language can be used to offer your criticism or ideas on literature, or art, or other artistic pursuits.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, so before we listen to this dialogue for the first time, let's take a look at Vocabulary Preview.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, we're going to look at one word here that we will hear in the dialogue, and it is erudite.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Erudite.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Erudite.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, so this word erudite, some people pronounce it erudite.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's true.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And basically it's an adjective describing someone who has a lot of knowledge about a subject.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, so an erudite in engineering.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, or an erudite professor.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, very good.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So that's the word that we're going to preview today.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And now let's listen to our dialogue and find out what movie they are criticizing.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Welcome back, movie lovers, to another Premiere Movie Review.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
My name is Richard Clark, and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you, Dick.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tell me, what is your impression of this film?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, I think this film is simply a fable depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries, the musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think otherwise.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacked certain originality.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It lacked heart.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Predictable?

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Come on, Dave.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a G-rated movie.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's for the kids.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not a thriller.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, that's just it.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes, for example, when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Even so, the film is linear.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault, falls in love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's just too cliche.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How can it be cliche?

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a fable.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's telling a time-honored story.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power leads to corruption, and teaches children of the value of respect, life, and love.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have always been so soft, Dick.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hahahaha!

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Open your heart, Dave.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't shut us out.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Anyway, that's all for today, folks.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Join us next time as we talk about how to lose a guy in ten days.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Alright, so The Lion King, one of my all-time favorites.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A very good movie, and, well, mixed feelings about it, right?

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Some people think it's good, other people think it's not that good.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm in the good camp, as you know, but anyway, there's tons of really useful and quite difficult language here, so why don't we look at that now in Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Alright, on Language Takeaway today, we have five words, and we can start with the first one.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So the first critic said that this was a movie depicting man's eternal greed for power.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Depicting.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To depict.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Alright, so this word, depict, it sounds a little bit strange, so before we explain it, let's take a look at some examples.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Example one.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't really like the way that novel depicted the role of women in society.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It was pretty sexist.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Example two.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The film depicts the realities of war very accurately.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Example three.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
See, this image here is depicting some of the most well-known scenes from Australian history.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Alright, so depicting.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can basically understand that this means to show something.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, we can notice that the word depict has this short little word picked in there that sounds like picture, and when we think about depicting, we're often thinking about in a picture or in a book or in a painting.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So in this case, the story is depicted in a movie, right?

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So you can see it.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a picture, basically.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Alright, very good.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So to depict.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, moving on, the critic also talked about the grim portrayal of the villain of the movie, Scar.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So grim portrayal.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A grim portrayal.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, let's look at the word grim first.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When something is grim, it's really unpleasant or uncomfortable or even shocking to think about.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, so something that is grim.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now what about portrayal?

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Really close to depict.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A portrayal is something that shows or describes something, especially like in a book or in a picture or in a play.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, so a portrayal.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I guess we can relate it again to a portrait.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's right.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Alright, so portrayal.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, we can also use this as a verb, to portray.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So this movie portrays man's eternal greed.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, so we can use this as a noun or as a verb.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's right.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, moving on with our third word today, we have an enchanting movie.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's right, the story was simply enchanting.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, so if something is enchanting.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's really attractive and beautiful and interesting and it holds your attention.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, it holds your attention.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So it's something very nice.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Something that is enchanting has to be nice.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right, and it has this sense of magic around it.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, very good.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, an enchanting moment.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Or an enchanting woman.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, and now, what about our next word?

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's French, actually, but we use it in English.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So, the critics said that this story was cliche.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Cliche.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Cliche.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, so we hear this all the time.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is a cliche?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, basically, a cliche is a phrase or an idea that is used so often that it loses its meaning or importance or interest.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, so can you give us some examples of a cliche moment or maybe a phrase that's cliche?

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, well, how about this one?

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
When you're breaking up with your boyfriend and you say, Honey, it's not you, it's me.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay, that's cliche.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's typical.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yeah, or maybe a cliche portrayal of a French man would be a guy riding a bike with a baguette, smoking a cigarette, and with a beret on his head.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, that's a cliche portrayal.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Very good.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, it's common.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's even, to a certain point, a little bit stereotypical.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That's right.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And what about our last word?

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, they describe this story as a fable.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Fable.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A fable.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, so when we were small, we all read fables.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They are stories about animals that are used to teach people a lesson.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, so a fable teaches you a lesson.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I think the most famous one is the one of the tortoise and the hare, right?

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, and another good one would be the three little pigs.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay, that's also a fable.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yep.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, so we've looked at these five great words, and now it's time for us to move on to putting it together.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, here we're going to look at some phrases that you can use in a bunch of different ways to help you criticize or give your opinion about a piece of art, like a movie or a book or whatever.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, so let's start right away with our first word.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So the film critic asked, what is your impression of this film?

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's your impression of?

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What's your impression of something, right?

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right, so before we get into explaining impression, let's listen to some more examples.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Example one.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know where, but I have the impression that we've met before.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Example two.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I get the impression that he's a very organized person.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Example three.

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Somehow Jim got the impression that I was gay.

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Did you tell him that?

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, so I can see that this means basically, what's your opinion or how do you feel about something?

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, so you can have an impression of something or of someone?

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yep.

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All right.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And what about the next word?

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, the critic Richard Clarke said that it was a really enjoyable film, even despite the accusations of plagiarism.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, so now we have an interesting phrase here, the accusations of plagiarism.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Accusations of plagiarism.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, so accusations is a noun, right?

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right, it's the action of accusing.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, of blaming somebody.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, and what about plagiarism?

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is an academic term.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you plagiarize, you copy someone's work and take credit for it.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, so if I copy somebody's book and I say I wrote it, then that's plagiarism.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
All right.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So accusations of plagiarism.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Now we can use this phrase accusations of something in a bunch of different ways.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So Marco, let's have an example.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
All right, so for example, we can say he was cleared of all accusations of tax evasion.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He denied accusations of cheating on his wife.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All right, very good.

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So accusations.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And now moving on to the final part of putting it together, we have this word lacks.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The film lacks a certain originality.

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, so the film lacks a certain originality.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What does he mean by that?

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It doesn't have enough of.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, so if you are lacking something, you don't have enough of it.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Or you don't have it at all.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All right, so can you give us some more examples of how we can use lack?

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay, the same way it's used in the dialogue, our team lacks the appropriate talent to complete this project.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay, or I can say our school lacks infrastructure for so many students.

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or we can also say infrastructure is lacking at our school.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay, so you can use it in those two ways, right?

198
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You can use it as a gerund or as a verb.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's right.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, lots of great language here.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And why don't we hear it one more time in context with the dialogue.

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Welcome back, movie lovers, to another premiere movie review.

203
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
My name is Richard Clark, and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you, Dick.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Today, we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

206
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Tell me, what is your impression of this film?

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, I think this film is simply a fable depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

208
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries, the musical score was amazing.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think otherwise.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacked certain originality.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It lacked heart, and I would dare to say it was too predictable.

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Predictable?

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How?

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Come on, Dave, it's a G-rated movie.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's for the kids.

217
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's not a thriller.

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, that's just it.

219
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For example, when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Even so, the film is linear.

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault, falls in love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

223
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's just too cliché.

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How can it be cliché?

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a fable.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's telling a time-honored story.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power leads to corruption, and teaches children of the value of respect, life, and love.

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have always been so soft, Dick.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Open your heart, Dave.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't shut us out.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Anyway, that's all for today, folks.

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Join us next time as we talk about how to lose a guy in ten days.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
All right, so a good movie.

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What do you think about The Lion King?

236
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What do you think about his critique?

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, I am with Dick on this one.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think that this is a great film.

239
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It was one of my favorites, and I've seen it about five billion times.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Really?

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yep.

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You really liked it.

243
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But I'm not interested in my opinion.

244
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I want to hear criticisms and film criticisms from our users.

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right, so come to our website at EnglishPod.com where you can leave your questions, your comments, and also any criticisms on this particular movie or maybe the other one that we mentioned, How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Personally, not so fond of that one, but looking forward to hearing from our users.

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
All right, or maybe any other movies you might like.

248

So come to the website, and until next time.
