00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Welcome back, movie lovers, to another premiere movie review.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
My name is Richard Clark, and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Thank you, Dick.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tell me, what is your impression of this film?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, I think this film is simply a fable depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries, the musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think otherwise.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacked certain originality.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It lacked heart.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Predictable?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Come on, Dave.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's a G-rated movie.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's for the kids.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's not a thriller.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, that's just it.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes, for example, when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even so, the film is linear.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault, falls in love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's just too cliche.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How can it be cliche?

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a fable.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's telling a time-honored story.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power leads to corruption, and teaches children of the value of respect, life, and love.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You have always been so soft, Dick.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Open your heart, Dave.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't shut us out.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Anyway, that's all for today, folks.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Join us next time as we talk about how to lose a guy in ten days.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.
