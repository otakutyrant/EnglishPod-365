00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:11,220
Welcome back, movie lovers, to another premiere movie review.

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,600
My name is Richard Clark, and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,559
Thank you, Dick.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,339
Today we're going to talk about the movie Lion King.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,480
Tell me, what is your impression of this film?

6
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:30,219
Well, I think this film is simply a fable depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film.

7
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:40,659
Even despite the accusations of plagiarism of traditional folk tales from other countries, the musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.

8
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,579
I think otherwise.

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,340
Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacked certain originality.

10
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,420
It lacked heart.

11
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,020
And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.

12
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,140
Predictable?

13
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,920
How?

14
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:56,399
Come on, Dave.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,759
It's a G-rated movie.

16
00:00:58,179 --> 00:00:59,060
It's for the kids.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,520
It's not a thriller.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,659
Well, that's just it.

19
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,500
It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes, for example, when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar.

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,980
Even so, the film is linear.

21
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,680
Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault, falls in love and returns to retake what's rightfully his.

22
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
It's just too cliche.

23
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,959
How can it be cliche?

24
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:20,900
It's a fable.

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,200
It's telling a time-honored story.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,560
The movie makes a point of how the hunger of power leads to corruption, and teaches children of the value of respect, life, and love.

27
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,400
You have always been so soft, Dick.

28
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,040
Open your heart, Dave.

29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,260
Don't shut us out.

30
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,159
Anyway, that's all for today, folks.

31
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,120
Join us next time as we talk about how to lose a guy in ten days.

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,780
I'm sure you'll love that one, Dick.
