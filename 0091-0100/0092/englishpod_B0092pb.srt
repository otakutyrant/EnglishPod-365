00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:04,139
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,240
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,660
And today we are going back in time.

5
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,019
That's right, we're visiting the 1950s.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:25,460
Alright, so we are going to the year 1950, and well, we are going to look at some of the typical and common words and phrases that were used back in that year.

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,439
Yes, all of these words and phrases you might still hear today, but they are really a little bit old-fashioned.

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,380
Alright, so we have some words that we need to look at before we listen to our dialogue, so let's look at these words in vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,719
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,000
The first one, sock hop.

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:50,280
Sock hop.

12
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,399
A sock hop.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,399
Okay, now this is very old-fashioned and probably not used anymore.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,500
No, not used anymore.

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,539
But a sock hop is a school dance.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,060
Okay, so all the kids after school would get together and dance rock and roll in the gym or something.

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,120
And, well, it's very popular and very common among American culture in those days.

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,319
Yes, in 1950.

19
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,340
So you would still maybe see this in a movie or something like that.

20
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,739
And our second word is still used today.

21
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,799
Sadie Hawkins dance.

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,859
A Sadie Hawkins dance.

23
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,219
Alright, a Sadie Hawkins dance.

24
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:34,540
So a Sadie Hawkins dance is a dance when the girls ask the guys to be their date.

25
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,519
Okay, so it's a party and the guys don't invite the girls.

26
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,959
No, the girls invite the guys.

27
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,959
Okay, so it's a little bit of a reverse of roles there.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,299
Yes.

29
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:51,239
That's interesting, so in this case the girls have to come up to the guys and say, hey, do you want to go to the dance with me?

30
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,459
Very good.

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,439
So this still happens today in North America, so you will probably hear it sometime.

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,400
And I guess now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time, and it takes place at a high school.

33
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,520
Heyya, Tracy, how are you doing?

34
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:13,780
I'm swell, Sandy.

35
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,120
Hey, listen, you want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

36
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,000
It'll be a blast.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,240
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,819
The girls got to ask the guys also.

39
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:23,340
Oh, right.

40
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:25,060
So when are you going to ask me?

41
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,759
I've had my eye on you for a while.

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,960
Hey, buddy, ease off my girl, man, or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

43
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,400
Cool it, guys.

44
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,000
Your girl?

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,020
Says who?

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,379
Says me, pipsqueak.

47
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,719
Alright, so a little bit of a discussion over a girl.

48
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,060
Very common as well.

49
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:48,539
Yes, yep.

50
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:54,180
So we're going to be looking at some of these words that were maybe a little bit difficult in the dialogue in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,080
Well, we've got five phrases and words from the dialogue.

52
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,319
Now, the first thing we heard was Sandy said, heyya.

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,199
Heyya.

54
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:08,879
Heyya.

55
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,840
Alright, now, an interjection, a way of saying hi, but very old fashioned, heyya.

56
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:14,259
Yep.

57
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,280
Basically, hi, you.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,340
Or hey, you.

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:17,800
Yep.

60
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,280
Okay, so heyya.

61
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,860
I guess you would still use it today, though, right?

62
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,180
Yeah, it's still a normal way to greet someone.

63
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:25,699
Alright.

64
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,599
Very friendly.

65
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,379
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,520
Okay, and what about our second word?

67
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,039
Well, Sandy asked Tracy, how are you?

68
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,919
And Tracy replies, I'm swell.

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,860
I'm swell.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,819
Swell.

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,139
I'm just swell.

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,599
When you are swell, you are great.

73
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,280
You're great.

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,560
And again, swell is an old fashioned way of saying I'm good or I'm great, but you would still hear it.

75
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,919
Yes, and it also is used to describe things.

76
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,599
That was a swell party.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,900
Okay, swell.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Yep.

79
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,020
Alright, now for our next word.

80
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:00,879
They got into a fight and Tracy said, cool it, guys.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,879
Cool it.

82
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:02,879
Cool it.

83
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,379
Cool it.

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,939
So, why don't we listen to some examples of cool it before we explain it.

85
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:11,240
Example one.

86
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,740
Just cool it.

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,879
Now is not the right time to get angry.

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,399
Example two.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
You need to cool it and stop yelling at me.

90
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,360
Example three.

91
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:34,519
Don't cry, Pam.

92
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Just cool it.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,779
You will be okay.

94
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,920
Alright, so cool it, guys.

95
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,699
Basically, it means relax.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,660
Take it easy.

97
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,180
Yeah.

98
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,300
Don't get into a fight.

99
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,300
Okay.

100
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,139
This is one my dad used to say to me and my sisters all the time.

101
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,120
Cool it, kids.

102
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:51,800
Stop fighting.

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,660
Very good.

104
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,300
So, it is still very commonly used, I would say.

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
Alright, now for our last two words.

106
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,379
These are a little bit more old fashioned.

107
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,600
Yes, straight from 1952.

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,800
They talk about a knuckle sandwich.

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,699
Alright, he says, do you want a knuckle sandwich?

110
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,839
A knuckle sandwich.

111
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,259
What are we talking about here?

112
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,139
Alright, well, on your hand, you have, above your fingers, you have your knuckles.

113
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,019
Okay, so those are the bumpy parts on my hand.

114
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,120
Yeah, the bones on the top part of your hand.

115
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,720
So, he's basically saying, do you want me to punch you?

116
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,259
Right, do you want me to hit you with my hand, with my fist?

117
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,800
So, it's a very informal way of saying a punch, knuckle sandwich.

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,720
I'll give you a knuckle sandwich.

119
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,139
Right.

120
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,759
And, for our last word, he called, Tommy called Sandy a pipsqueak.

121
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,000
Pipsqueak.

122
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,439
Pipsqueak.

123
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:44,970
A pipsqueak.

124
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,920
Now, this is kind of an insult, but again, very old fashioned.

125
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,420
Yes.

126
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,279
A pipsqueak is a very small person, right?

127
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:55,180
A small person who is not strong.

128
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:55,720
Okay.

129
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,620
Or not powerful.

130
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,459
So, a small and weak person.

131
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:00,519
Pipsqueak.

132
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,180
I guess nowadays, you can still call somebody pipsqueak, but maybe in a lighter sense.

133
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,540
It would be a little bit funny to call someone a pipsqueak.

134
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,060
Okay.

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,740
So, a pipsqueak.

136
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,180
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

137
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,740
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can get all these words that we just looked at.

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,939
And then, we'll come back and look at some phrases.

139
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:29,660
Heyya, Tracy.

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,220
How are you doing?

141
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,459
I'm swell, Sandy.

142
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,060
Hey, listen.

143
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,819
You want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

144
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,220
It'll be a blast.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,879
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

146
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,680
The girls got to ask the guys.

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,759
Also...

148
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,540
Oh, right.

149
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,959
So, when are you going to ask me?

150
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,519
I've had my eye on you for a while.

151
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,480
Hey, buddy.

152
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,540
Ease off my girl, man.

153
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,939
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

154
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,259
Cool it, guys.

155
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:03,579
Your girl says who?

156
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,160
Says me, pipsqueak.

157
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,740
Okay.

158
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:18,199
So, that was a little bit easier to understand, but some great 50s style phrases and words.

159
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,839
So, why don't we look at some of these phrases now in Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,399
All right.

161
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,379
On Fluency Builder today, we're going to look at three phrases.

162
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,199
Why don't we start with the first one?

163
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,980
Sandy said that the party will be a blast.

164
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
It'll be a blast.

165
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,319
It'll be a blast.

166
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,860
To be a blast.

167
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,579
So, if something is a blast, it's very fun.

168
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:41,939
It's entertaining.

169
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,480
Yes.

170
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:43,560
Really, really fun.

171
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,199
Okay.

172
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,779
So, the party was a blast.

173
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,579
I had a great time last night.

174
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:48,600
It was a blast.

175
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:49,339
Okay.

176
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:50,399
Very good.

177
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,860
So, very fun times.

178
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:55,019
And you'll still hear this phrase used today.

179
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,860
Now, the next one.

180
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,360
So, Sandy said he had his eye on Tracy.

181
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,699
He said, I've had my eye on you.

182
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,519
To have your eye on someone.

183
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,420
So, if I have my eye on the new iPhone that came out.

184
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:13,180
You are watching it carefully because you want it.

185
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,600
Okay.

186
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,439
So, I'm keeping my attention on it because I want it.

187
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,319
I have my eye on that sweater because it's on sale.

188
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:21,959
Okay.

189
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,519
So, you really want that sweater.

190
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:24,860
Yeah.

191
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,699
All right.

192
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,939
So, to have your eye on something or on someone.

193
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
And for our last phrase.

194
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,399
Tommy told Sandy, hey buddy, ease off my girl.

195
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,960
Ease off.

196
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,220
Ease off.

197
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,039
Ease off.

198
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,740
All right.

199
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,259
So, why don't we listen to some examples of how we could use ease off.

200
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,960
Because it might be a little bit tricky.

201
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,259
And then we'll come back and talk about it.

202
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,019
Example one.

203
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,620
You need to ease off the junk food.

204
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
Example two.

205
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,720
Matt is putting so much pressure on me these days.

206
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,940
I wish he would ease off.

207
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,340
Example three.

208
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
You're pushing Susie too much.

209
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,639
You need to ease off a bit.

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,220
Okay.

211
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,639
So, it looks like you say this phrase, ease off.

212
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:28,600
When somebody is putting pressure on you or doing something to you that they shouldn't.

213
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:28,960
Right.

214
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:31,879
Maybe they're being too intense or maybe annoying you.

215
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,879
So, you tell them, hey, ease off.

216
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,059
Yeah.

217
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:34,500
Relax.

218
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,179
Stay back.

219
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:36,059
Stay away.

220
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:36,659
Very good.

221
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:37,960
So, ease off.

222
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,059
Ease off my girlfriend.

223
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,139
Ease off the fatty foods.

224
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,860
All right.

225
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,000
So, take it easy.

226
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:43,799
Stay away from.

227
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:44,200
Yep.

228
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,100
Okay.

229
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,779
So, some great phrases there.

230
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,759
I think it's a good idea for us to listen to our dialogue one more time.

231
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,080
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the 1950s.

232
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,200
Heyya, Tracy.

233
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,879
How are you doing?

234
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,200
I'm swell, Sandy.

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,500
Hey, listen.

236
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,500
You want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

237
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,379
It'll be a blast.

238
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,600
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

239
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,200
The girls got to ask the guys also.

240
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,700
Oh, right.

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,419
So, when are you going to ask me?

242
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:17,100
I've had my eye on you for a while.

243
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, buddy.

244
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,519
Ease off my girl, man.

245
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,240
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

246
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,779
Cool it, guys.

247
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,360
Your girl?

248
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,379
Says who?

249
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,399
Says me, pipsqueak.

250
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,299
Okay, so the 1950s, a nice era.

251
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:47,500
And this is the first of a small series that we're going to have of different words and phrases that were used back in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, etc.

252
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,279
That's right.

253
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,759
So, a little bit more time travel is coming up here in EnglishPod.

254
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,399
Exactly.

255
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:03,759
Because a lot of these phrases are still used and you might even see them in movies or if you're talking to somebody that was maybe born in these eras, they might even still use them today.

256
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:04,720
That's right.

257
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:11,000
So, do you guys know any English phrases or slangs from the 1950s?

258
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,500
Why don't you visit our website at EnglishPod.com to tell us about it?

259
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,179
All right.

260
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,259
We'll see you guys there.

261
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,799

00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,240

00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:24,700
Goodbye.

264
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,980
Bye.

265
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:33,399
Bye.
