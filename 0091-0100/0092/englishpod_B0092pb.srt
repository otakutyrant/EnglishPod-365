00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we are going back in time.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right, we're visiting the 1950s.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Alright, so we are going to the year 1950, and well, we are going to look at some of the typical and common words and phrases that were used back in that year.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, all of these words and phrases you might still hear today, but they are really a little bit old-fashioned.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alright, so we have some words that we need to look at before we listen to our dialogue, so let's look at these words in vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The first one, sock hop.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sock hop.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A sock hop.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, now this is very old-fashioned and probably not used anymore.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, not used anymore.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But a sock hop is a school dance.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, so all the kids after school would get together and dance rock and roll in the gym or something.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And, well, it's very popular and very common among American culture in those days.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, in 1950.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So you would still maybe see this in a movie or something like that.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And our second word is still used today.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sadie Hawkins dance.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A Sadie Hawkins dance.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, a Sadie Hawkins dance.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So a Sadie Hawkins dance is a dance when the girls ask the guys to be their date.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, so it's a party and the guys don't invite the girls.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No, the girls invite the guys.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, so it's a little bit of a reverse of roles there.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's interesting, so in this case the girls have to come up to the guys and say, hey, do you want to go to the dance with me?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Very good.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So this still happens today in North America, so you will probably hear it sometime.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I guess now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time, and it takes place at a high school.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Heyya, Tracy, how are you doing?

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm swell, Sandy.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, listen, you want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It'll be a blast.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The girls got to ask the guys also.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, right.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So when are you going to ask me?

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've had my eye on you for a while.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hey, buddy, ease off my girl, man, or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Cool it, guys.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your girl?

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Says who?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Says me, pipsqueak.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Alright, so a little bit of a discussion over a girl.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Very common as well.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, yep.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we're going to be looking at some of these words that were maybe a little bit difficult in the dialogue in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, we've got five phrases and words from the dialogue.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now, the first thing we heard was Sandy said, heyya.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Heyya.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Heyya.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Alright, now, an interjection, a way of saying hi, but very old fashioned, heyya.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yep.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Basically, hi, you.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Or hey, you.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yep.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, so heyya.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I guess you would still use it today, though, right?

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah, it's still a normal way to greet someone.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Alright.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Very friendly.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, and what about our second word?

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, Sandy asked Tracy, how are you?

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And Tracy replies, I'm swell.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm swell.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Swell.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm just swell.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When you are swell, you are great.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're great.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And again, swell is an old fashioned way of saying I'm good or I'm great, but you would still hear it.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes, and it also is used to describe things.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That was a swell party.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, swell.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yep.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Alright, now for our next word.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They got into a fight and Tracy said, cool it, guys.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Cool it.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Cool it.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Cool it.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So, why don't we listen to some examples of cool it before we explain it.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Example one.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Just cool it.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now is not the right time to get angry.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Example two.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You need to cool it and stop yelling at me.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Example three.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't cry, Pam.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Just cool it.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You will be okay.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Alright, so cool it, guys.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Basically, it means relax.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Take it easy.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't get into a fight.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is one my dad used to say to me and my sisters all the time.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Cool it, kids.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Stop fighting.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Very good.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So, it is still very commonly used, I would say.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Alright, now for our last two words.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
These are a little bit more old fashioned.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes, straight from 1952.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They talk about a knuckle sandwich.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Alright, he says, do you want a knuckle sandwich?

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A knuckle sandwich.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What are we talking about here?

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alright, well, on your hand, you have, above your fingers, you have your knuckles.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, so those are the bumpy parts on my hand.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, the bones on the top part of your hand.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, he's basically saying, do you want me to punch you?

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Right, do you want me to hit you with my hand, with my fist?

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, it's a very informal way of saying a punch, knuckle sandwich.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll give you a knuckle sandwich.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And, for our last word, he called, Tommy called Sandy a pipsqueak.

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Pipsqueak.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Pipsqueak.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A pipsqueak.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now, this is kind of an insult, but again, very old fashioned.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A pipsqueak is a very small person, right?

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
A small person who is not strong.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Or not powerful.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, a small and weak person.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Pipsqueak.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I guess nowadays, you can still call somebody pipsqueak, but maybe in a lighter sense.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It would be a little bit funny to call someone a pipsqueak.

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So, a pipsqueak.

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can get all these words that we just looked at.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And then, we'll come back and look at some phrases.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Heyya, Tracy.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How are you doing?

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm swell, Sandy.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hey, listen.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It'll be a blast.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The girls got to ask the guys.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Also...

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, right.

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So, when are you going to ask me?

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've had my eye on you for a while.

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hey, buddy.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ease off my girl, man.

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Cool it, guys.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your girl says who?

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Says me, pipsqueak.

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, that was a little bit easier to understand, but some great 50s style phrases and words.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, why don't we look at some of these phrases now in Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
On Fluency Builder today, we're going to look at three phrases.

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why don't we start with the first one?

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Sandy said that the party will be a blast.

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It'll be a blast.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It'll be a blast.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
To be a blast.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, if something is a blast, it's very fun.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's entertaining.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Really, really fun.

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay.

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, the party was a blast.

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I had a great time last night.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It was a blast.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Very good.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, very fun times.

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And you'll still hear this phrase used today.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now, the next one.

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So, Sandy said he had his eye on Tracy.

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He said, I've had my eye on you.

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
To have your eye on someone.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, if I have my eye on the new iPhone that came out.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You are watching it carefully because you want it.

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So, I'm keeping my attention on it because I want it.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have my eye on that sweater because it's on sale.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So, you really want that sweater.

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
All right.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So, to have your eye on something or on someone.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And for our last phrase.

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Tommy told Sandy, hey buddy, ease off my girl.

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ease off.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Ease off.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ease off.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, why don't we listen to some examples of how we could use ease off.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Because it might be a little bit tricky.

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then we'll come back and talk about it.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Example one.

203
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You need to ease off the junk food.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Example two.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Matt is putting so much pressure on me these days.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I wish he would ease off.

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Example three.

208
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You're pushing Susie too much.

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You need to ease off a bit.

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

211
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So, it looks like you say this phrase, ease off.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When somebody is putting pressure on you or doing something to you that they shouldn't.

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Right.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Maybe they're being too intense or maybe annoying you.

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, you tell them, hey, ease off.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Relax.

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Stay back.

219
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Stay away.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Very good.

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, ease off.

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ease off my girlfriend.

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ease off the fatty foods.

224
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
All right.

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So, take it easy.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Stay away from.

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yep.

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay.

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So, some great phrases there.

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it's a good idea for us to listen to our dialogue one more time.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the 1950s.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Heyya, Tracy.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How are you doing?

234
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm swell, Sandy.

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey, listen.

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You want to go to the sock hop with me this Friday?

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It'll be a blast.

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
First of all, it's the Sadie Hawkins dance.

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The girls got to ask the guys also.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, right.

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, when are you going to ask me?

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've had my eye on you for a while.

243
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, buddy.

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ease off my girl, man.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Or do you want a knuckle sandwich?

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Cool it, guys.

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Your girl?

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Says who?

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Says me, pipsqueak.

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, so the 1950s, a nice era.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And this is the first of a small series that we're going to have of different words and phrases that were used back in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, etc.

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's right.

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, a little bit more time travel is coming up here in EnglishPod.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Exactly.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because a lot of these phrases are still used and you might even see them in movies or if you're talking to somebody that was maybe born in these eras, they might even still use them today.

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's right.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So, do you guys know any English phrases or slangs from the 1950s?

258
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why don't you visit our website at EnglishPod.com to tell us about it?

259
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All right.

260
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We'll see you guys there.

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Goodbye.

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Bye.

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Bye.
