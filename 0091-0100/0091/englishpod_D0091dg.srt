00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Oh, honey, this is so romantic.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've never seen, like, so many stars before.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's beautiful.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
See that constellation there?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's Orion.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And the very bright star?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's actually Venus.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's that, um, big, flashy one?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't know.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think it's a UFO.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Greetings, earthlings.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why are you here?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Where did you come from?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We have been observing you for the last three thousand years.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal, or masterpieces such as the Hafner Symphony.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to save your planet from you.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You think you have us figured out?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Silence, human.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now you will pay the price.
