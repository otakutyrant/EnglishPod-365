00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:10,279
EnglishPod.com Oh, honey, this is so romantic.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,359
I've never seen, like, so many stars before.

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:15,380
It's beautiful.

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,260
See that constellation there?

5
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:18,719
That's Orion.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
And the very bright star?

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,420
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,260
That's actually Venus.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,100
What's that, um, big, flashy one?

10
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,739
I don't know.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,719
I think it's a UFO.

12
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:47,799
Greetings, earthlings.

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,380
I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,820
Why are you here?

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,079
Where did you come from?

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,140
We have been observing you for the last three thousand years.

17
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:07,400
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal, or masterpieces such as the Hafner Symphony.

18
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,579
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

19
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,640
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to save your planet from you.

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,560
You think you have us figured out?

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,180
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

22
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,659
Who are you to play God with our fate?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,620
Silence, human.

24
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,859
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,299
Now you will pay the price.
