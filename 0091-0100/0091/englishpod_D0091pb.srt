00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:02,439
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,759
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:04,480
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:05,599
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:12,160
And today we're going to be looking at another kind of science fiction lesson related to aliens.

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,080
That's right.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,620
And I think in this lesson we'll actually have an alien sighting here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:19,539
Right, an alien encounter.

9
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,820
So we're going to be learning about the stars.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,280
We're going to be learning about aliens and UFOs today.

11
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,039
That's right.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:34,460
And we're also going to learn some language that you can use to describe negative results, things that happen that are bad.

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,079
That's right.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,460
So let's start by looking at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,399
Okay, we have two words for you that we're going to hear in the dialogue.

16
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:46,820
And the first one is constellation.

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,240
Constellation.

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:49,399
A constellation.

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,679
Alright, so we've all looked up in the sky and seen shapes or figures that are formed by the stars.

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,820
That's right, so a constellation is a group of stars that makes a shape and has a name.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:11,900
Right, there are a total of 88 known constellations so the most popular ones I think maybe are the Little Dipper, the Big Dipper, etc.

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,500
I never knew you were such a fan of astronomy, Marco.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,459
A little bit.

24
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,379
Alright, what about the next one?

25
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,400
The next one is Earthlings.

26
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:21,879
Earthlings.

27
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:22,879
Earthlings.

28
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,260
So Earthlings are people who live on planet Earth.

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,340
On Earth, exactly.

30
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,719
And in the dialogue we're going to hear, greetings Earthlings.

31
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:38,379
This is the most typical phrase that you will hear in almost every single alien movie.

32
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,920
Exactly, so it's like saying hello people from Earth.

33
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,780
Yes, every single alien in the world says this phrase.

34
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,719
So those are the two words that we are going to find in this dialogue today.

35
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,079
So why don't we start and listen to what happens with our UFO experience.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,480
Oh honey, this is so romantic.

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,580
I've never seen like so many stars before.

38
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,639
It's beautiful.

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,500
See that constellation there?

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,979
That's Orion.

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,060
And the very bright star?

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,639
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
That's actually Venus.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
What's that big flashy one?

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,979
I don't know.

46
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:27,979
I think it's a UFO.

47
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,039
Greetings Earthlings.

48
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,699
I come from afar.

49
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:46,699
From a distant galaxy known only to a few.

50
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,099
Why are you here?

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,520
Where did you come from?

52
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,379
We have been observing you for the last 3,000 years.

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,620
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal or masterpieces such as the Hafner Symphony.

54
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,139
Unfortunately your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

55
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,919
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall and we are here to save your planet from you.

56
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,860
You think you have us figured out?

57
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:16,379
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,860
Who are you to play God with our fate?

59
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:20,819
Silence human.

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,099
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,479
Now you will pay the price.

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Welp, that didn't work out so well for the Earthlings now did it?

63
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,280
I think the aliens are a little bit belligerent themselves.

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:04,680
Alright, so why don't we start by looking at some of those difficult words that we might have found in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

65
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:17,899
OK, well the aliens are using a lot of language to describe some of the negative results that are happening because of the human's behavior on Earth, right?

66
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:25,560
And so one of the things they said was that your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

67
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,699
Alright, so the consequence of an action are basically the results.

68
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:40,540
Yes, exactly, and here the phrase without consequence suggests the negative results.

69
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:44,439
Alright, so the negative results from your actions.

70
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,040
Very good.

71
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,319
What about our next word?

72
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,540
Well the aliens also talked about human ambition.

73
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,620
Ambition?

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,259
Ambition.

75
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:54,639
So what is ambition exactly?

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:04,079
So ambition is the desire or the want for things to be better, to improve, to get rich, to be technologically advanced.

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,779
OK, so to want more.

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,019
You have ambitions in your life, in your professional life, in your personal life.

79
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,259
So basically we have ambition and we have desires and these are the reasons for our downfall.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,300
OK, so downfall will be your downfall.

81
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,399
So the downfall of something is?

82
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,500
Something that causes failure.

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,620
OK, so the loss of wealth or the loss of reputation or that it gets ruined.

84
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,259
Exactly.

85
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,240
The downfall.

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,540
We can say like for example the downfall of the Roman Empire.

87
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:45,480
Or you know what, this guy is a great employee but his lack of ambition was his downfall.

88
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,279
Very good.

89
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,259
Alright, coming up to our next word.

90
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,180
The alien described that humans have a belligerent attitude.

91
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,339
Belligerent.

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,639
Belligerent.

93
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,319
Belligerent.

94
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,019
Alright, this is a very nice word so why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use it in context.

95
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Example one.

96
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,639
Don't take that belligerent tone with me.

97
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,839
I don't want to argue with you.

98
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,660
Example two.

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,199
Thomas is always so belligerent.

100
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,300
It is impossible to talk to him.

101
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,399
Example three.

102
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,379
Stacey was fired for her belligerent attitude.

103
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:37,000
OK, so I can understand that it means sort of aggressive, having a strong willingness to fight.

104
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Exactly.

105
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,139
A belligerent person.

106
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,279
A belligerent attitude.

107
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:41,939
A belligerent country.

108
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:42,519
OK.

109
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,360
Very good.

110
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,399
And our last word for today.

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,420
Anguish.

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,339
Anguish.

113
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,079
Anguish.

114
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:50,399
So to cause great anguish.

115
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,199
To cause a lot of terrible emotional or physical pain.

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,139
OK, so it is a synonym of pain, of suffering.

117
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,240
Yeah, but really intense suffering.

118
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,139
Really intense.

119
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,560
Why don't we give a few examples.

120
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,279
The end of his marriage caused him great anguish.

121
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:13,660
Or for example, the loss of his dog caused him great anguish.

122
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,339
OK, so anguish.

123
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:19,220
Alright, so we've covered five great words on language takeaway today.

124
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,180
Why don't we move on now to putting it together.

125
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,259
Putting it together.

126
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:35,100
OK, we're going to look at three phrases that we heard in the dialogue and see how we can use them in different contexts.

127
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:42,000
So the aliens were praising some of the masterpieces that the humans have created, right?

128
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,699
Right.

129
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,240
He said, you humans create such wonders as the Taj Mahal, blah, blah, blah.

130
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:50,839
OK.

131
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,680
So let's look at this phrase.

132
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,459
Such wonders as.

133
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,500
Alright, so we have a noun here, a wonder.

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,420
An amazing thing.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,480
An amazing structure.

136
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:00,899
Yes.

137
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,360
So he says such wonders as.

138
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,519
Now we can change this noun and replace it with another one, right?

139
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,420
Yeah, we can we can replace that noun with anything.

140
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,100
So why don't we hear a few examples?

141
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:12,980
Example one.

142
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:19,399
To finish this house, we need such materials as cement, wood and steel.

143
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,819
Example two.

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,040
I need to write a report on a social topic such as psychology, health or marriage.

145
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,820
Example three.

146
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,019
I need to write a report on a social topic.

147
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,159
Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great marketing opportunities.

148
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,740
So this is a really useful structure to use when you want to give examples of many different things.

149
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:59,159
OK, and as the alien was criticizing the humans, the guy said, what gives you the right to come and judge us?

150
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,039
So interesting phrase.

151
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,620
What gives you the right?

152
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,559
What gives you the right?

153
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,700
What gives you the right?

154
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:12,740
Alright, so if I tell you what gives you the right to and then a verb, what am I saying there?

155
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,919
You're basically saying you don't have the right to do this.

156
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,200
You shouldn't do this.

157
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,779
Why are you doing it or why do you want to have this control over me?

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Yep.

159
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:25,500
So when would be when would you use this phrase?

160
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:37,039
If somebody is trying to control you or maybe somebody is judging you or doing something to you against your will, maybe you would say what gives you the right to take my phone away?

161
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,519
What gives you the right to tell me what to do?

162
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,480
Alright, it's a good phrase to tell that other person that they shouldn't do that.

163
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,720
They're doing something unfair.

164
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:46,740
Unfair, OK.

165
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,139
And our next phrase is very similar.

166
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

167
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,960
OK, so I want to look at this.

168
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,600
To play God.

169
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,220
Alright, so to play God is making these arbitrary decisions like he is the master of everything, right?

170
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,259
Controlling everything.

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,659
But this phrase, who are you to?

172
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:16,360
So basically saying you don't have the power or authority to do this and you can use it in exactly the same way.

173
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,279
Who are you to tell me what to do?

174
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,799
Who are you to take away my phone?

175
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,539
Exactly, so you don't have the power to do this.

176
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:24,080
Very good.

177
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,759
So these phrases are a little bit aggressive, almost belligerent, wouldn't you say?

178
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:38,639
A little bit, but I guess if you are being treated unfair or if you are angry at a situation, it would be a good phrase to use to put your point across.

179
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:42,080
Yes, and as we saw, these humans are pretty angry.

180
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:48,360
So why don't we listen again as they're telling the aliens, who are you to do this to us?

181
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,480
Oh, honey, this is so romantic.

182
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,559
I have never seen like so many stars before.

183
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,580
It's beautiful.

184
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,460
See that constellation there?

185
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,980
That's Orion and the very bright star.

186
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,620
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

187
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,500
That's actually Venus.

188
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,259
What's that big, flashy one?

189
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:20,820
I don't know.

190
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,960
I think it's a UFO.

191
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
Greetings earthlings.

192
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,559
I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

193
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,059
Why are you here?

194
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,320
Where did you come from?

195
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,360
We have been observing you for the last three thousand years.

196
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,679
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal or masterpieces such as the Hafner symphony.

197
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,080
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

198
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,860
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to save your planet from you.

199
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,759
You think you have us figured out?

200
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,360
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

201
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,899
Who are you to play God with our fate?

202
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:15,840
Silence human.

203
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,059
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

204
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,460
Now you will pay the price.

205
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,779
Okay, so UFOs and constellations and stars and planets.

206
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,440
Have you ever had an encounter with one of these?

207
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,299
Well, definitely not an encounter with a UFO, but maybe with some of the wonders of the night sky.

208
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,779
What happened?

209
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,840
Well, you know, when I was small, I used to have my vacations up in northern Canada.

210
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:08,200
And because it was so far away from the city, it was really dark.

211
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,700
And you could see all of these shooting stars.

212
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,899
So these stars moving across the sky and lighting up the whole sky with their brightness.

213
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,120
And it really is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

214
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,460
So shooting stars, those are like balls of fire that move across the sky, right?

215
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,320
Yeah, exactly.

216
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:38,220
And I saw once, actually, I was in an astronomy class and turned around and over the horizon, like at the end of the sky where the sky meets the earth, I saw this huge ball of fire move across the sky.

217
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,779
And it looked like it landed in the field next to us.

218
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,759
It was so close.

219
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:42,740
Wow, that's nice.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Yeah, pretty amazing.

221
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,840
Well, I imagine that it is really amazing.

222
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,299
And I guess Canada is the place to be when you want to see these things.

223
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,899
I know we've got like, Northern Lights, we've got shooting stars, lots of stuff.

224
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:55,600
All right.

225
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,159
So what about you guys?

226
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,299
You should tell us if you've ever seen a shooting star or a meteor, or something of this type of astronomy things, right?

227
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,840
