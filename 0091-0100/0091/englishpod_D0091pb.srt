00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're going to be looking at another kind of science fiction lesson related to aliens.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And I think in this lesson we'll actually have an alien sighting here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Right, an alien encounter.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we're going to be learning about the stars.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to be learning about aliens and UFOs today.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we're also going to learn some language that you can use to describe negative results, things that happen that are bad.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's start by looking at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, we have two words for you that we're going to hear in the dialogue.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And the first one is constellation.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Constellation.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A constellation.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Alright, so we've all looked up in the sky and seen shapes or figures that are formed by the stars.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's right, so a constellation is a group of stars that makes a shape and has a name.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right, there are a total of 88 known constellations so the most popular ones I think maybe are the Little Dipper, the Big Dipper, etc.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I never knew you were such a fan of astronomy, Marco.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A little bit.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Alright, what about the next one?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The next one is Earthlings.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Earthlings.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Earthlings.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So Earthlings are people who live on planet Earth.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
On Earth, exactly.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And in the dialogue we're going to hear, greetings Earthlings.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is the most typical phrase that you will hear in almost every single alien movie.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Exactly, so it's like saying hello people from Earth.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, every single alien in the world says this phrase.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So those are the two words that we are going to find in this dialogue today.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So why don't we start and listen to what happens with our UFO experience.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh honey, this is so romantic.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've never seen like so many stars before.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's beautiful.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
See that constellation there?

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's Orion.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the very bright star?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's actually Venus.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's that big flashy one?

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think it's a UFO.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Greetings Earthlings.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I come from afar.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
From a distant galaxy known only to a few.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why are you here?

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where did you come from?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We have been observing you for the last 3,000 years.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal or masterpieces such as the Hafner Symphony.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Unfortunately your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall and we are here to save your planet from you.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You think you have us figured out?

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Silence human.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now you will pay the price.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Welp, that didn't work out so well for the Earthlings now did it?

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I think the aliens are a little bit belligerent themselves.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, so why don't we start by looking at some of those difficult words that we might have found in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,000
OK, well the aliens are using a lot of language to describe some of the negative results that are happening because of the human's behavior on Earth, right?

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And so one of the things they said was that your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Alright, so the consequence of an action are basically the results.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, exactly, and here the phrase without consequence suggests the negative results.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright, so the negative results from your actions.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Very good.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What about our next word?

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well the aliens also talked about human ambition.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ambition?

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ambition.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So what is ambition exactly?

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So ambition is the desire or the want for things to be better, to improve, to get rich, to be technologically advanced.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
OK, so to want more.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You have ambitions in your life, in your professional life, in your personal life.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So basically we have ambition and we have desires and these are the reasons for our downfall.

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
OK, so downfall will be your downfall.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So the downfall of something is?

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Something that causes failure.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OK, so the loss of wealth or the loss of reputation or that it gets ruined.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Exactly.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The downfall.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We can say like for example the downfall of the Roman Empire.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Or you know what, this guy is a great employee but his lack of ambition was his downfall.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Very good.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Alright, coming up to our next word.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The alien described that humans have a belligerent attitude.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Belligerent.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Belligerent.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Belligerent.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Alright, this is a very nice word so why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use it in context.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Example one.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't take that belligerent tone with me.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't want to argue with you.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Example two.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thomas is always so belligerent.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It is impossible to talk to him.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Example three.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stacey was fired for her belligerent attitude.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OK, so I can understand that it means sort of aggressive, having a strong willingness to fight.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Exactly.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A belligerent person.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A belligerent attitude.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A belligerent country.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
OK.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Very good.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And our last word for today.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Anguish.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Anguish.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Anguish.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So to cause great anguish.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
To cause a lot of terrible emotional or physical pain.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OK, so it is a synonym of pain, of suffering.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah, but really intense suffering.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Really intense.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why don't we give a few examples.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The end of his marriage caused him great anguish.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or for example, the loss of his dog caused him great anguish.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OK, so anguish.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Alright, so we've covered five great words on language takeaway today.

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why don't we move on now to putting it together.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Putting it together.

126
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
OK, we're going to look at three phrases that we heard in the dialogue and see how we can use them in different contexts.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So the aliens were praising some of the masterpieces that the humans have created, right?

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He said, you humans create such wonders as the Taj Mahal, blah, blah, blah.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
OK.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So let's look at this phrase.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Such wonders as.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Alright, so we have a noun here, a wonder.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
An amazing thing.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
An amazing structure.

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So he says such wonders as.

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now we can change this noun and replace it with another one, right?

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, we can we can replace that noun with anything.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So why don't we hear a few examples?

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Example one.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
To finish this house, we need such materials as cement, wood and steel.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Example two.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I need to write a report on a social topic such as psychology, health or marriage.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Example three.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I need to write a report on a social topic.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great marketing opportunities.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So this is a really useful structure to use when you want to give examples of many different things.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,000
OK, and as the alien was criticizing the humans, the guy said, what gives you the right to come and judge us?

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So interesting phrase.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What gives you the right?

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What gives you the right?

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What gives you the right?

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Alright, so if I tell you what gives you the right to and then a verb, what am I saying there?

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're basically saying you don't have the right to do this.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You shouldn't do this.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you doing it or why do you want to have this control over me?

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yep.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So when would be when would you use this phrase?

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If somebody is trying to control you or maybe somebody is judging you or doing something to you against your will, maybe you would say what gives you the right to take my phone away?

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What gives you the right to tell me what to do?

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Alright, it's a good phrase to tell that other person that they shouldn't do that.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They're doing something unfair.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Unfair, OK.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And our next phrase is very similar.

166
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

167
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OK, so I want to look at this.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
To play God.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Alright, so to play God is making these arbitrary decisions like he is the master of everything, right?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Controlling everything.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But this phrase, who are you to?

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So basically saying you don't have the power or authority to do this and you can use it in exactly the same way.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who are you to tell me what to do?

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who are you to take away my phone?

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Exactly, so you don't have the power to do this.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Very good.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So these phrases are a little bit aggressive, almost belligerent, wouldn't you say?

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A little bit, but I guess if you are being treated unfair or if you are angry at a situation, it would be a good phrase to use to put your point across.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes, and as we saw, these humans are pretty angry.

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So why don't we listen again as they're telling the aliens, who are you to do this to us?

181
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, honey, this is so romantic.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have never seen like so many stars before.

183
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's beautiful.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
See that constellation there?

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's Orion and the very bright star.

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, it's not a star because it doesn't blink.

187
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's actually Venus.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What's that big, flashy one?

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't know.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I think it's a UFO.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Greetings earthlings.

192
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I come from afar, from a distant galaxy known only to a few.

193
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why are you here?

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Where did you come from?

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We have been observing you for the last three thousand years.

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We have seen the amazing capacity that humans have to create such wonders as the Taj Mahal or masterpieces such as the Hafner symphony.

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Unfortunately, your intelligence and creativity does not come without consequence.

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Your ambition and desire for more will be your downfall, and we are here to save your planet from you.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You think you have us figured out?

200
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What gives you the right to come and judge us?

201
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Who are you to play God with our fate?

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Silence human.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It is that belligerent attitude that has caused years of pain and anguish among yourselves.

204
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now you will pay the price.

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, so UFOs and constellations and stars and planets.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Have you ever had an encounter with one of these?

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, definitely not an encounter with a UFO, but maybe with some of the wonders of the night sky.

208
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What happened?

209
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, you know, when I was small, I used to have my vacations up in northern Canada.

210
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And because it was so far away from the city, it was really dark.

211
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And you could see all of these shooting stars.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So these stars moving across the sky and lighting up the whole sky with their brightness.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And it really is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

214
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So shooting stars, those are like balls of fire that move across the sky, right?

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I saw once, actually, I was in an astronomy class and turned around and over the horizon, like at the end of the sky where the sky meets the earth, I saw this huge ball of fire move across the sky.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And it looked like it landed in the field next to us.

218
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It was so close.

219
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Wow, that's nice.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah, pretty amazing.

221
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, I imagine that it is really amazing.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And I guess Canada is the place to be when you want to see these things.

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I know we've got like, Northern Lights, we've got shooting stars, lots of stuff.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,000
All right.

225
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So what about you guys?

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You should tell us if you've ever seen a shooting star or a meteor, or something of this type of astronomy things, right?

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Or even a UFO.
