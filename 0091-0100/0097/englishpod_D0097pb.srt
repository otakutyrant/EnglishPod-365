00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,099
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:07,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,839
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,859
And today we are going to be talking about the weather.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:12,720
That's right.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,039
And you know, Marco, this is a really, really useful and important topic in English, isn't it?

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,539
Exactly, because if you ever travel abroad, you always want to know about the weather, right?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,120
That's right.

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:28,359
And Anglo people, English people, all they ever do is talk about the weather.

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,920
Well, it's an important topic.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,780
You want to know what clothes to wear or if you should take an umbrella.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,060
Or even when you're making small talk with people.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,899
Exactly.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,000
So we're going to be taking a look at the weather in the United States.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,460
But before we get started with the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,500
Vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,179
Okay, so we have two words we're going to hear in the dialogue.

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,079
Now the first one is forecast.

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,460
Forecast.

20
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,420
Weather forecast.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,500
So this is what we listen to or what we see on the television, the weather forecast, right?

22
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,659
It's like the prediction of the weather.

23
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,319
Okay, so forecast.

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,760
Can I only use it in the weather?

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,939
No, of course you can use it in many other different situations like in business, for example, forecast sales.

26
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,420
Okay, so the prediction of sales.

27
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,659
Very good.

28
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:24,159
And we have one more word on vocabulary preview, a shower, a shower, shower, shower.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,500
So when it rains for a short time and it's not too heavy, that's a shower.

30
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:30,760
Okay, very good.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,579
So it's very similar to a shower at home.

32
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:33,959
Right.

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,060
Like a little bit of water.

34
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,219
And it doesn't last too long.

35
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,260
Okay, very good.

36
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,299
So why don't we listen to our dialogue now.

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,879
We are going to be listening to the weatherman as he describes the weather in Utah.

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,879
And now let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,819
Thank you, Bill.

40
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,500
And good morning, Salt Lake City.

41
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,579
What's the weather looking like today, Kenny?

42
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,939
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

43
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:04,579
We've got heavy cloud cover here in northern Utah and we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day with a daytime high of 45 degrees.

44
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,819
Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in.

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,800
We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold with temperatures hovering around a 30 degree mark.

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,860
It's a chilly day, folks, so don't forget your coats.

47
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,659
What about tomorrow, Kenny?

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
Do you have good news for us?

49
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:22,719
Well, it'll be a rainy day for northern Utah.

50
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,979
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,840
Winds will be coming in from the northeast with gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

52
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,659
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening.

53
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,039
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

54
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:36,580
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers.

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,860
Later in the day, we can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

56
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,240
You heard it, folks.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,439
It's going to be a cold one.

58
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,300
That's right, Bill.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,560
We'll have more later on today on the 6 o'clock news.

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,620
That's the weather forecast for this morning.

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,340
Alright, so we listened to the weather forecast and it doesn't seem like nice weather in Utah, huh?

62
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,979
No, it certainly doesn't.

63
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,900
I don't think that I'd really like to live there.

64
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,780
Well, maybe it's winter or something like that.

65
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,360
Well, I guess, yeah, maybe it's good for skiing.

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:18,219
Okay, so now I think it's time for us to take a look at some of those maybe difficult words that we may have listened to in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

67
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,419
Alright, here we're going to look at some words and phrases that you can use to describe the weather.

68
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:34,340
Now, the first one, we heard in the weather forecast that they were calling for scattered showers.

69
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,219
Scattered showers.

70
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,060
Scatter.

71
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,000
Scattered.

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,680
If something is scattered.

73
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,219
It's sort of like it's a little bit of that thing everywhere.

74
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,860
Okay, so and we already talked about what showers were.

75
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,180
Right, so showers, a small bit of, a small amount of rain.

76
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,259
Okay, very good.

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,680
To better understand when something is scattered, imagine that we are in a playground and the children are playing in the playground.

78
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,139
Okay.

79
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,159
So the children are scattered everywhere.

80
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,539
Some of them are playing on the swing, some of them are playing on the grass or in the sandbox.

81
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,620
So children, a little bit of children in every different spot.

82
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,220
So if we think that the city is a playground, maybe in one part of the city there's a little bit of rain but not in the other part.

83
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:22,740
Exactly.

84
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,839
That's a scattered shower.

85
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,540
Very good.

86
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,139
Moving on to our second word, we have hovering.

87
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:29,500
Hovering.

88
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,740
Temperatures hovering around the 30 degree mark.

89
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,879
The temperature is hovering around.

90
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,399
Okay, so when I say the temperatures are hovering.

91
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,860
You mean it's approximately.

92
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,139
Okay, so they can move up and down.

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,019
So maybe it'll be a little bit warmer than 30 degrees or a little bit colder.

94
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,519
Yes.

95
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,259
So if you think of hovering as floating.

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,540
Okay, very good.

97
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,699
So why don't we listen to some more examples of how we could use hovering in different situations.

98
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,420
Example 1.

99
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,560
Unemployment rates are hovering around the 10% mark despite the government's attempts to stimulate the economy.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,860
Example 2.

101
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,439
The waiters kept hovering around us all night.

102
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,639
It was really annoying.

103
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,360
Example 3.

104
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,420
The company's margin this year is hovering around the 40% mark.

105
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,980
Okay, so pretty clear.

106
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,279
Hovering is sort of floating around one area.

107
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,120
Very good.

108
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,199
Now, let's move on to the next part.

109
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,980
We saw that we're going to have isolated downpours.

110
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:35,600
Isolated downpours.

111
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:37,879
Isolated downpours.

112
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,620
Okay, let's break this one down.

113
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,019
Let's start with downpour.

114
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,740
A downpour is when you have a lot of rain.

115
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,220
Very strong rain.

116
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:46,879
That's right.

117
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,939
For maybe a short amount of time, it's really raining heavily.

118
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:50,500
Right.

119
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:52,740
So that's what a downpour is.

120
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,300
And if we take a look at the first word, isolated.

121
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,800
So in one small area.

122
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,660
Okay, confined it to a specific area.

123
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,139
That's right.

124
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,660
Okay, so we have an isolated downpour.

125
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,000
It'll be raining in one specific area.

126
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,459
And you hear this a lot with weather language.

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,360
You hear isolated showers, isolated snowstorms.

128
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,420
Exactly.

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,139
So it'll be in a specific area only.

130
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,199
Alright, so along with these showers and rain, we also talked about wind.

131
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,740
And we heard that we will have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

132
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,800
So we're going to have gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

133
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,120
Gusts of wind.

134
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,920
Okay, so can you explain to our listeners what gusts are?

135
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,959
Okay, so a gust is a sudden increase in the amount of wind.

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,120
Okay, so maybe we'll have normal wind and all of a sudden it will get really windy.

137
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,519
That's right, for a short amount of time.

138
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,620
Okay, that's a gust.

139
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,040
G-U-S-T, gust.

140
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,399
Gust of wind.

141
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,060
And for our final word on language takeaway today, we're going to have sleet.

142
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:55,959
Sleet?

143
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,480
Sleet.

144
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,540
Alright, sleet is a terrible kind of weather.

145
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:03,879
It's sort of a mixture between snow and rain.

146
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,819
So sleet is kind of this strange mix between ice and rain and snow.

147
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,480
So just imagine, it's not completely ice, so it's not solid.

148
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,939
But it's not water, right?

149
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,540
It's not rain.

150
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:17,839
And it's not snow either.

151
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,819
No, it's in the middle.

152
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,279
Okay.

153
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,620
Alright, so sleet.

154
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,759
But what you really need to know is that it's terrible.

155
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,160
Alright, so that's all the words we have today for language takeaway.

156
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,759
Let's move on now to fluency builder.

157
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,399
Alright, in fluency builder today we're going to look at three phrases that are really common when you're talking about the weather.

158
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,519
Now we heard in the dialogue that there was a cold front moving in.

159
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,000
A cold front moving in.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,639
A cold front is moving in.

161
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,439
Okay, so a cold front.

162
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,819
Imagine a wall of cold air and it comes towards a place and then it changes the pressure in the atmosphere.

163
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,699
Okay, so a very sudden amount of cold air that comes into a place.

164
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,160
So we say a cold front is moving in.

165
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,139
So we always think of these cold fronts or warm fronts as moving.

166
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,839
So you can either say they're moving in or you can say a cold front is coming in.

167
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,180
Okay, very good.

168
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,420
And okay, we have a cold front that's moving in and we're going to have winds that will be coming in from the northeast.

169
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:29,579
Okay, winds coming in from.

170
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,759
Okay, winds coming in from.

171
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,139
So when I say it's coming in from.

172
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,259
You're talking about its origin, where it starts.

173
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,559
Okay, so if I change the noun and I say and I don't say winds anymore but maybe I'll say my friends.

174
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,879
My friends are coming in from.

175
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,720
Chicago.

176
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,600
Chicago, so they are arriving from Chicago.

177
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,320
What else can I say?

178
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,879
Or you can also say the kids are coming in from outside.

179
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,460
Okay, so where they were before.

180
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,600
Very good.

181
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,360
So coming in from, you can change the noun a little bit and you can form these new sentences.

182
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,600
Great, now our final phrase.

183
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,960
We heard the announcer say it's going to be a cold one.

184
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,200
It's going to be a cold one.

185
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,220
It's going to be a cold one.

186
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,039
So I have this phrase, it's going to be a cold one.

187
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,860
What do I mean by a cold one?

188
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,240
Okay, so the one represents the event, so the day.

189
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,120
Okay, so it's going to be a cold day.

190
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,559
Yes.

191
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:25,399
Okay.

192
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,279
Now we can obviously change the adjective, right?

193
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
So it's going to be a hot one, it's going to be a long one, it's going to be a long day.

194
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:33,360
Alright.

195
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,940
But the one can mean anything.

196
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,299
Okay, so it can be a day, it can be an event.

197
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:39,960
A meeting.

198
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,899
Okay.

199
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:41,639
A project.

200
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:46,440
So for example, if we're going to a meeting, I might say, hey Marco, this is going to be a hard one.

201
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,379
Okay, so the one represents the meeting.

202
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:49,820
That's right.

203
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,220
This is going to be a hard meeting.

204
00:09:51,879 --> 00:10:02,120
Alright, I think this is a very good phrase and it's very commonly used, so why don't we listen to some more examples of how we can use it's going to be a something one.

205
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,399
Example one.

206
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:08,740
Temperatures have forecasted to hit 37 degrees today.

207
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,299
It's going to be a hot one folks.

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,879
Example two.

209
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,340
It's only 8am and I've got 100 emails already.

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,159
It's going to be a long one today.

211
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,279
Example three.

212
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,500
I haven't studied at all for the exam.

213
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,960
It's going to be a tough one.

214
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:38,299
Okay, so some great examples and I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again and now we can understand all these words and phrases that we've just talked about.

215
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:43,440
And now, let's go to Kenny Williams for today's weather forecast.

216
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,019
Thank you Bill and good morning Salt Lake City.

217
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,120
What's the weather looking like today Kenny?

218
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,500
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

219
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,120
We've got heavy cloud cover here in northern Utah and we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day with a daytime high of 45 degrees.

220
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,360
Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in.

221
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:05,340
We can expect clear skies but it will be quite cold with temperatures hovering around the 30 degree mark.

222
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,419
It's a chilly day folks, so don't forget your coats.

223
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,179
What about tomorrow Kenny?

224
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,799
Do you have good news for us?

225
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,259
Well, it'll be a rainy day for northern Utah.

226
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,519
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

227
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,419
Winds will be coming in from the northeast with gusts reaching 23 miles per hour.

228
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,200
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening.

229
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,580
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

230
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,139
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers.

231
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,399
Later in the day we can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

232
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,980
You heard it folks, it's going to be a cold one.

233
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,840
That's right Bill.

234
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,100
We'll have more later on today on the 6 o'clock news.

235
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,000
That's the weather forecast for this morning.

236
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:55,240
Okay, so we know that in English speaking countries, the weather is always, always, always a great subject of conversation for small talk, right?

237
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,620
Exactly, if you ever want to talk to somebody or start a conversation, the weather is always the number one topic.

238
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:05,419
Yep, and we actually have a phrase in this dialogue that would be great for starting a conversation.

239
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:14,360
Like for example, imagine if you lived here in Utah and you were wanting to start a conversation with someone, you could say, it sure is a cold one today, isn't it?

240
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:21,000
Exactly, that's a great way of starting a conversation and English speaking people love to talk about the weather as you say.

241
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:30,639
