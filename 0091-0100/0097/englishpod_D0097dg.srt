00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you, Bill, and good morning Salt Lake City.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What's the weather looking like today, Kenny?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, it's a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today.

We've got heavy cloud cover here in northern Utah, and we're calling for scattered showers throughout the day with a daytime high of 45 degrees.

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can expect clear skies, but it will be quite cold with temperatures hovering around the 30-degree mark.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a chilly day, folks, so don't forget your coats.

What about tomorrow, Kenny?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do you have good news for us?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, it'll be a rainy day for northern Utah.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We can expect some isolated downpours in the morning.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Winds will be coming in from the northeast, with gust reaching 23 miles per hour.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Things are looking a bit better for the south.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We'll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Later in the day, we can expect partly cloudy skies with a forecast high of 38 degrees.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You heard it, folks.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's going to be a cold one.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's right, Bill.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
