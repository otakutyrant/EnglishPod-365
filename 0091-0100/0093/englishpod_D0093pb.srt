00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're bringing you another part of our sports series, and today we're gonna be talking about volleyball.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right, and we're going all the way to New Zealand to visit the men's volleyball championships.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're gonna be looking at some great words and phrases related to volleyball, and also how to describe a sporting event.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Alright, so before we start on the dialogue, let's take a look at two words on vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, we're gonna hear both of these words in the dialogue.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, the first one, encounter.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Encounter.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
An exciting encounter.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Alright, so if we have an exciting encounter, it means we have an exciting meeting of two people or two teams or two groups.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I say I had an incredible encounter last night with my best friend.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You met up with your best friend and something happened.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, so that's what an encounter would mean.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Looking at our second word now, powerhouse.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Two powerhouse teams.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Alright, so we have two powerhouse teams, China and Brazil.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So a powerhouse team is basically a strong, powerful, really energetic, great team, right?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, so we can use it for teams, such as in this case, but we can also describe maybe a company or a person as a powerhouse.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That guy is a powerhouse, he can lift 500 pounds.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the first time.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We're gonna be listening to this great sporting event as we are taken to New Zealand to see China and Brazil play.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball World Championship.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you, Rick.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The ref signals the start of the game and here we go.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Chun bumps it to the center and a very nice set by Chun.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xu spikes it, wow, what a great hit.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him, but he managed to get the ball in.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Great play.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's China's service now.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What a superb jump serve by Li.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, oh, and we have a let's serve.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Brazil calls for a time out and we'll be right back after a short commercial break.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, sounds like a pretty exciting encounter between these two countries.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Very good teams and both of them, as they mentioned, are powerhouse teams.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that we came across in this dialogue.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We're going to be focusing on volleyball words here in Language Takeaway.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Language Takeaway.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OK, so in Language Takeaway today, we're going to have six words, and let's start with the first one.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Chun bumps it to the center, right, to bump.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right, so in volleyball, when you are going to receive the ball, you put your arms together and you hit it with your forearms.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So at the top of your arm.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And that's how you pass it to another player.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's called a bump.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So it is a noun and a verb, a bump to bump.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Exactly.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, another type of way to move the ball in volleyball we heard in the dialogue is a set.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A very nice set by Chen.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So a set or to set.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Right.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The word can be used as a verb and a noun.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And again, you take the ball and you move it with the tips of your fingers.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That is actually done by the setter.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That is done by the setter.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And he does this.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He sets the ball so then the attacker can spike the ball.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's our next word to spike.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So to spike the ball or a spike is when you hit the ball very hard and very fast with the palm of your hand.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's right.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And that's how you score your points.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Exactly.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So you'll see three basic moves, the bump set and spike.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But what about the serve?

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So our fourth word in volleyball is service.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So it's China's service now.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Right.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So the service is the opportunity for the team to serve the ball.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Pretty simple.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And that means basically to start the game by hitting it to the other side.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now one type of serve is the jump serve.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Jump serve.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Jump serve.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now this is very popular and you will see some players do this.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They will throw the ball in the air and then jump in the air and hit it.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So that's a jump serve.

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And our last word for today is let's serve.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A let's serve.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We have a let's serve today.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So a let's serve is when you serve the ball and it sort of brushes over the net.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It'll hit the net, but it will still pass to the other side.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And that's an illegal move in volleyball, isn't it?

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When you are serving, yes.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So a let's serve.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So those are the six terms related to volleyball that we're going to be looking at today.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And well, with this in mind, let's move on to looking at some phrases now in what is it?

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Fluency builder.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Fluency builder.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So our two announcers, Bob and Rick, said that we've got an exciting encounter ahead of us.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Right.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So they use this phrase ahead of us.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ahead of us.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So basically, what does that mean?

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Something will happen in the very near future.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So they are expecting it or they will encounter it, maybe.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So why don't we give a few examples of this phrase?

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Marco, we've got a long day ahead of us.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have a very exciting trip ahead of us today.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So ahead of us.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So we know it's an exciting game and we heard the announcers say without a doubt, both teams are in top shape.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So the phrase without a doubt.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Without a doubt.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So if I start a phrase using without a doubt.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're basically saying there's no question.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's so obvious.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This definitely is true.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's very true.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So without a doubt, EnglishPod is the best podcast out there.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Without a doubt, this is the strategy we should take.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Very good.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So without a doubt.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why don't we move on to our third phrase now?

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This will prove to be a competitive match.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So let's look at the phrase will prove to be something we'll prove to be.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So before we get into it, why don't we listen to some examples?

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Example one.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And I think you'll prove to be the greatest president we've ever had.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Example two.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The new HR policy is proving to be a waste of time.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Example three.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We were worried that we were going to get laid off, but our fears proved to be untrue.

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So when something will prove to be, it will show itself to be this thing, right?

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It will demonstrate.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We will see it.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We will see for sure how it will be.

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And now for our fourth phrase, a very simple one, but very common in sports commentators or when you're watching a game, you'll say great play.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Great play.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Great play.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A great play.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now we know play is usually a verb, right?

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But here it's acting as a noun.

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
A play is basically a move in a sport or a game.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So when somebody says a great play, it means all the succession of moves and passes and hits to make the point.

162
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So it was a great play.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can use that for any sport.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue now for the second time, and then we'll come back and talk about this very popular sport, volleyball.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men's Volleyball World Championship.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My name is Rick Fields and I'm joined by the man with the plan, Bob Copeland.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you, Rick.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We've got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape, and this will prove to be a competitive match.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The ref signals the start of the game, and here we go.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Ribeiro serves and China quickly receives the ball.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Chun bumps it to the center, and a very nice set by Chun.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Xu spikes it.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wow, what a great hit.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him, but he managed to get the ball in.

177
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Great play.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's China's service now.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What a superb jump serve by Lee.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, oh, and we have a let's serve.

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Brazil calls for a time out, and we'll be right back after a short commercial break.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So are you a volleyball fan, Marco?

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a very nice sport.

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's very fast and it's very hard.

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yep.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But it's very interesting to get together with friends, maybe at the beach and play some beach volleyball or something like that.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, I think that's the best place to play volleyball.

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You know, we even have beach volleyball up in freezing cold Canada.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And do you have sand?

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Occasionally.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, so volleyball is a great sport, but now we want to know what sport you want to learn about.

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
