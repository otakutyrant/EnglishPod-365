00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,679
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,419
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,480
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,960
And today we have a very special lesson because we're going to be focusing a little bit more on grammar.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,980
We're going to look today at the difference between past simple and past progressive or sometimes called past continuous.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,039
Exactly.

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,260
So we are going to take a look at these two structures, which are a little bit confusing at times.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,320
And we're going to be practicing today.

11
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,340
But before we get started, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,740
Well, this dialogue is all about telling a story in the past.

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,859
And we're going to hear two words in the dialogue that we need to understand the meaning of.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:01,460
So the Basically, you haven't seen me in a really long time.

15
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:01,939
Okay.

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,379
So it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

17
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:04,739
Yes.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,359
And this word, ages, we can use in many different ways.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,500
Like, I've been studying English for ages.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,299
Or for example, I can say, I haven't been to the dentist in ages.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
Oh, well, I guess you better go, huh?

22
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,239
Right.

23
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,359
So ages a very long time.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:24,739
Yes.

25
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:29,340
Now another phrase to run into somebody.

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,659
So to run into somebody, I ran into Matt.

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:40,040
Okay, so if you ran into Matt the other day, you met him unexpectedly.

28
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,640
Okay, so you didn't plan to meet you didn't have a date, right?

29
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,159
Just casually on the street met.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:47,859
Exactly.

31
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,099
Okay, so I ran into your friend the other day.

32
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,459
Okay, so two good words.

33
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,359
We're gonna hear both of these in the dialogue.

34
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,260
So why don't we get started with dialogue first time?

35
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,459
Mike, what's going on, man?

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,560
Long time no see.

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,319
Hey, Pat.

38
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,759
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

39
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,360
How's it going?

40
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:11,819
Things are going great.

41
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,740
It's funny running into you like this small world, huh?

42
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,340
You know, just last week, I ran into Matt as well.

43
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,159
Yeah, how's he doing?

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,139
He's doing well.

45
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,960
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

46
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:23,460
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,759
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,039
Talking about work and family when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse running the chair and he completely lost it.

49
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,580
So freaking out and screaming.

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,300
Really?

51
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,139
Yeah.

52
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,159
And the funniest thing was, then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

53
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,360
You should have been there.

54
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,900
Everyone's staring and laughing.

55
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:42,979
It was hilarious.

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,520
All right, very good.

57
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,620
So a funny story.

58
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,979
And as we saw a lot of stuff in the past, right?

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,419
That's right.

60
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,379
And we're gonna look at that in a moment.

61
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:03,979
But first, we've got lots of exciting language to describe when somebody gets really emotional.

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,879
Okay, why don't we start now with language takeaway?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,680
Language takeaway.

64
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,300
We have four words here.

65
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,659
Now, in the dialogue, the guy in the story lost it.

66
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,280
So he saw a mouse and he completely lost it.

67
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,620
To lose it.

68
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,060
Okay.

69
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,659
So when you lose something, you lose it.

70
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,340
What are you losing?

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,719
You're losing control of yourself and your emotion.

72
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,120
Okay, so you lose your temper, maybe.

73
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,439
Yep.

74
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,219
So when I lose it, do I just get angry?

75
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,439
Angry or upset or even sad.

76
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,180
But it's usually a negative feeling.

77
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,219
Okay, so it's not a good thing to lose it.

78
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,479
No.

79
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,379
So for example, when I showed my boss the sales figures, he completely lost it.

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,599
Okay, very good.

81
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,539
So that's what lose it means.

82
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,620
And now our second word is very similar but has a little bit of a difference.

83
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,580
That's right.

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,379
He started freaking out.

85
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,860
Okay, so to freak out.

86
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,000
To freak out.

87
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,319
Now, freak out is very similar to lose it, right?

88
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,600
Yeah, but why don't we hear an example now of somebody freaking out?

89
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,019
It's just, no, no.

90
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay, forget it.

91
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,139
Forget it.

92
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,399
All right, just forget it.

93
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,920
I don't even wanna, just, I just wanna forget it.

94
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,079
I just wanna forget it.

95
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,860
I don't know.

96
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,480
I don't know.

97
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,319
Okay, calm down.

98
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,860
I gotta calm down.

99
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm so happy.

100
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,779
I can't even express it.

101
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,579
I'm like, have I even finished one sentence?

102
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,240
I'm like, give me a high five, baby.

103
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:58,040
All right, so we heard this person freaking out and basically it could be losing control or losing your temper but also in a positive way.

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,000
Right, so maybe you're really excited about something that's going to happen, so you're freaking out.

105
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,180
Okay, maybe you're very nervous or you're very excited.

106
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,939
All right, and now moving on to our third word, stare.

107
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,600
To stare.

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,579
People started to stare.

109
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,399
Staring.

110
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,060
Okay, now when you stare at someone or at something.

111
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,920
You look at and focus at something for a really long time.

112
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,399
Okay, so you are looking at it.

113
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,639
Yeah, I'm focusing on it.

114
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,759
Yeah, longer than usual.

115
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,339
All right, maybe when we were small our parents taught us that it's not nice to stare at other people.

116
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:35,779
Exactly.

117
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,920
All right, so to stare.

118
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,120
And our final word, when Matt saw the mouse he started shrieking.

119
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,660
All right, so to shriek.

120
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:46,560
Shriek.

121
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:47,360
Shriek.

122
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,160
Very similar to that movie Shrek.

123
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,319
Oh yeah, it sounds quite similar.

124
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,600
All right, but it's different.

125
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:53,720
What does shriek mean?

126
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,279
Well, why don't we listen to an example?

127
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:01,400
Oh my god.

128
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:12,879
Okay, so I think shrieking is to shout in a very high-pitched voice.

129
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,120
Exactly, that's to shriek.

130
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, so we saw four really great words in language takeaway, and why don't we listen now to the dialogue for a second time, a little bit slower, and then we'll come back and look at the differences between simple past and past progressive.

131
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,139
Oh yeah?

132
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:09,839
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing, talking about work and family, when all of a sudden Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it.

133
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,540
He started freaking out and screaming.

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,000
Really?

135
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,120
Yeah, and the funniest thing was then he jumped on his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

136
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,660
You should have been there.

137
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,259
Everyone was staring and laughing.

138
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,439
It was hilarious.

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:31,279
Okay, so there was a lot of different uses of past tense here in this dialogue, wasn't there?

140
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:35,639
Yeah, since he was telling a story that happened, he used the past a lot.

141
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,139
Well, let's now, as promised, look at past simple and past progressive in Grammar Breakdown.

142
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,060
Grammar Breakdown.

143
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:54,180
Okay Marco, before we start our discussion, why don't we hear one example of past simple and one example of past progressive?

144
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,500
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

145
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,879
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

146
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:15,620
Okay, so we heard that just last week I ran into Matt, so we discussed what run into means.

147
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,459
Yep, to meet someone by surprise.

148
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,920
All right, and now this structure is the simple past, right?

149
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,160
Yep.

150
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,339
Now the second example that we heard was we were talking and catching up.

151
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,519
Okay, so let's look at the difference in meaning here.

152
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,879
I ran into Matt, happened in the past, right?

153
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
Right, simple past.

154
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,139
But one moment in the past.

155
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,899
So the action finished, concluded.

156
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,519
Started and finished all around the same time, so it's one simple moment.

157
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,559
Okay, now the other example is in the past progressive.

158
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,360
So the action was happening for a longer period of time.

159
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,720
Yeah, okay, so let's attach some times to this.

160
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,840
Maybe you ran into Matt at 8.04, okay?

161
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:13,500
And so the action started at 8.04, but you were talking and catching up from 8.05 until 9.05.

162
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,700
Okay, so you were talking for an hour.

163
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:23,179
Right, so it's the past progressive you use when the action is happening for a longer period of time.

164
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,980
Okay, so to better understand this, let's have another example.

165
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,199
Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it.

166
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,279
Everyone was staring and laughing.

167
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,100
So as we heard in the example, he saw a mouse run under his chair.

168
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,019
So a quick action that started and finished quickly.

169
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,360
Okay, he saw the mouse and it ran under the chair.

170
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:53,100
Now the second example we heard was everyone was staring and laughing.

171
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,779
So maybe this happened over four or five minutes.

172
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,539
Okay, so people were looking at him and laughing and talking about how he was screaming like a girl.

173
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:01,980
Yes.

174
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,220
Okay, so that's the main difference between the simple past and the past progressive.

175
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,259
The amount of time that the action happened.

176
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,080
Yep, all right.

177
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:18,420
Well, now that we understand a little bit more about the past tense, why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for a third time?

178
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,059
Mike, what's going on, man?

179
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,179
Long time no see.

180
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:30,919
Hey, Pat.

181
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,379
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

182
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:32,960
How's it going?

183
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,440
Things are going great.

184
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,379
It's funny running into you like this.

185
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,299
Small world, huh?

186
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,960
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

187
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:40,980
Yeah?

188
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:41,759
How's he doing?

189
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,740
He's doing well.

190
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,580
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

191
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,019
Oh yeah?

192
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,399
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

193
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,639
Talking about work and family when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under the chair and he completely lost it.

194
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,179
He started freaking out and screaming.

195
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:57,019
Really?

196
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,759
Yeah, and the funniest thing was, then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,899
He should have been there.

198
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,500
Everyone was staring and laughing.

199
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:05,580
It was hilarious.

200
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,559
Hahaha.

201
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,539
Okay, perfect.

202
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:17,740
So now that we understand the words and the grammar behind it, there are some interesting phrases here that you can use casually with your friends.

203
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,340
Yeah, there's actually a lot of great sort of meeting and greeting and saying hello language.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,200
So for example, when they met up, since they were old friends, he said, hey, Pat.

205
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:29,840
Hey.

206
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,399
Okay, so this word, hey.

207
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:33,759
It's kind of like hi.

208
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:34,899
It's hi, right?

209
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,960
Normally you would use it to get somebody's attention, right?

210
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,860
Like, hey, I'm over here.

211
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:39,500
Hey, waiter.

212
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,379
Okay, yeah.

213
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,279
But in this case, like, hey, how's it going?

214
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:42,840
Or hi.

215
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,039
Yeah, so it's a really friendly and informal way of saying hi.

216
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,820
Okay, and then he asked, how's it going?

217
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,299
How's it going?

218
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,200
So again, this is a way of saying, how are you?

219
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,320
Yeah, Marco, what's the correct answer to this greeting?

220
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,460
Well, well, for example, he said things are going great, right?

221
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:04,580
You can say, yeah, things are great, or I'm doing well.

222
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,480
Or even great, you know, great.

223
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:07,840
Yeah.

224
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:08,879
So how's it going?

225
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,059
Oh, it's great.

226
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,460
Yeah.

227
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,240
Right.

228
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:18,740
Now, another one that we didn't see in the dialogue, but it's very popular is when somebody asks, hey, what's up?

229
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:19,980
Yeah, what's up?

230
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,299
So again, what is the right way to answer this question?

231
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:23,860
All right.

232
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,179
So when somebody says, what's up?

233
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,840
You can say, well, not much.

234
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,279
Or if maybe you have news or something that you want to share, you would say, well, I just got back from the doctor's office.

235
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:34,740
Right.

236
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,279
But you wouldn't say fine, thank you.

237
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,820
Or you wouldn't say very good or any of these other common answers to what's up.

238
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,000
It can be a little bit tricky.

239
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,039
So the rule is the normal thing to say when someone says, hey, what's up?

240
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,419
Is nothing much.

241
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,039
Not much.

242
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:51,340
Yeah.

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,960
All right.

244
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,679
So interesting ways of greeting casually with people, right?

245
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,679
You wouldn't use this for with your boss, maybe, or in an office setting?

246
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,039
Yeah.

247
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,820
More, more useful with your friends.

248
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:00,299
OK.

249
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:08,799

Bye.
