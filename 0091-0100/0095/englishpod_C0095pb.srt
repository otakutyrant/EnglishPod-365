00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we have a very special lesson because we're going to be focusing a little bit more on grammar.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to look today at the difference between past simple and past progressive or sometimes called past continuous.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we are going to take a look at these two structures, which are a little bit confusing at times.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And we're going to be practicing today.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But before we get started, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, this dialogue is all about telling a story in the past.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And we're going to hear two words in the dialogue that we need to understand the meaning of.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So the Basically, you haven't seen me in a really long time.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And this word, ages, we can use in many different ways.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Like, I've been studying English for ages.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Or for example, I can say, I haven't been to the dentist in ages.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, well, I guess you better go, huh?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Right.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So ages a very long time.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now another phrase to run into somebody.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So to run into somebody, I ran into Matt.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, so if you ran into Matt the other day, you met him unexpectedly.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so you didn't plan to meet you didn't have a date, right?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Just casually on the street met.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Exactly.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, so I ran into your friend the other day.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, so two good words.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
We're gonna hear both of these in the dialogue.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So why don't we get started with dialogue first time?

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mike, what's going on, man?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Long time no see.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hey, Pat.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How's it going?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Things are going great.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's funny running into you like this small world, huh?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know, just last week, I ran into Matt as well.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, how's he doing?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He's doing well.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Talking about work and family when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse running the chair and he completely lost it.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So freaking out and screaming.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Really?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And the funniest thing was, then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You should have been there.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Everyone's staring and laughing.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It was hilarious.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right, very good.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So a funny story.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And as we saw a lot of stuff in the past, right?

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And we're gonna look at that in a moment.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But first, we've got lots of exciting language to describe when somebody gets really emotional.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, why don't we start now with language takeaway?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Language takeaway.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We have four words here.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now, in the dialogue, the guy in the story lost it.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So he saw a mouse and he completely lost it.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
To lose it.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So when you lose something, you lose it.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What are you losing?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're losing control of yourself and your emotion.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, so you lose your temper, maybe.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yep.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So when I lose it, do I just get angry?

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Angry or upset or even sad.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But it's usually a negative feeling.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, so it's not a good thing to lose it.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So for example, when I showed my boss the sales figures, he completely lost it.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, very good.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So that's what lose it means.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And now our second word is very similar but has a little bit of a difference.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He started freaking out.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, so to freak out.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To freak out.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Now, freak out is very similar to lose it, right?

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, but why don't we hear an example now of somebody freaking out?

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's just, no, no.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, forget it.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Forget it.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right, just forget it.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't even wanna, just, I just wanna forget it.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I just wanna forget it.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, calm down.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I gotta calm down.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm so happy.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't even express it.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm like, have I even finished one sentence?

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm like, give me a high five, baby.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All right, so we heard this person freaking out and basically it could be losing control or losing your temper but also in a positive way.

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Right, so maybe you're really excited about something that's going to happen, so you're freaking out.

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, maybe you're very nervous or you're very excited.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right, and now moving on to our third word, stare.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
To stare.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
People started to stare.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Staring.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, now when you stare at someone or at something.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You look at and focus at something for a really long time.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay, so you are looking at it.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, I'm focusing on it.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, longer than usual.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All right, maybe when we were small our parents taught us that it's not nice to stare at other people.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Exactly.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right, so to stare.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And our final word, when Matt saw the mouse he started shrieking.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All right, so to shriek.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Shriek.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Shriek.

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Very similar to that movie Shrek.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh yeah, it sounds quite similar.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, but it's different.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What does shriek mean?

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, why don't we listen to an example?

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh my god.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, so I think shrieking is to shout in a very high-pitched voice.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Exactly, that's to shriek.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, so we saw four really great words in language takeaway, and why don't we listen now to the dialogue for a second time, a little bit slower, and then we'll come back and look at the differences between simple past and past progressive.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh yeah?

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing, talking about work and family, when all of a sudden Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it.

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He started freaking out and screaming.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Really?

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, and the funniest thing was then he jumped on his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You should have been there.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Everyone was staring and laughing.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It was hilarious.

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, so there was a lot of different uses of past tense here in this dialogue, wasn't there?

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah, since he was telling a story that happened, he used the past a lot.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, let's now, as promised, look at past simple and past progressive in Grammar Breakdown.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Grammar Breakdown.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay Marco, before we start our discussion, why don't we hear one example of past simple and one example of past progressive?

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay, so we heard that just last week I ran into Matt, so we discussed what run into means.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yep, to meet someone by surprise.

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right, and now this structure is the simple past, right?

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yep.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Now the second example that we heard was we were talking and catching up.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, so let's look at the difference in meaning here.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I ran into Matt, happened in the past, right?

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Right, simple past.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But one moment in the past.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So the action finished, concluded.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Started and finished all around the same time, so it's one simple moment.

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, now the other example is in the past progressive.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So the action was happening for a longer period of time.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yeah, okay, so let's attach some times to this.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe you ran into Matt at 8.04, okay?

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And so the action started at 8.04, but you were talking and catching up from 8.05 until 9.05.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay, so you were talking for an hour.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right, so it's the past progressive you use when the action is happening for a longer period of time.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, so to better understand this, let's have another example.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Matt saw a mouse run under his chair and he completely lost it.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Everyone was staring and laughing.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So as we heard in the example, he saw a mouse run under his chair.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So a quick action that started and finished quickly.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, he saw the mouse and it ran under the chair.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now the second example we heard was everyone was staring and laughing.

171
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So maybe this happened over four or five minutes.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay, so people were looking at him and laughing and talking about how he was screaming like a girl.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay, so that's the main difference between the simple past and the past progressive.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The amount of time that the action happened.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yep, all right.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, now that we understand a little bit more about the past tense, why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for a third time?

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mike, what's going on, man?

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Long time no see.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey, Pat.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, I haven't seen you in ages.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How's it going?

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Things are going great.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's funny running into you like this.

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Small world, huh?

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know, just last week I ran into Matt as well.

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah?

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How's he doing?

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's doing well.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We went out for a couple of beers and the funniest thing happened.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh yeah?

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, we were talking and catching up on what we've been doing.

193
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Talking about work and family when all of a sudden, Matt saw a mouse run under the chair and he completely lost it.

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He started freaking out and screaming.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Really?

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, and the funniest thing was, then he jumped onto his chair and started shrieking like a girl.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He should have been there.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Everyone was staring and laughing.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It was hilarious.

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hahaha.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, perfect.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So now that we understand the words and the grammar behind it, there are some interesting phrases here that you can use casually with your friends.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, there's actually a lot of great sort of meeting and greeting and saying hello language.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So for example, when they met up, since they were old friends, he said, hey, Pat.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, so this word, hey.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's kind of like hi.

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's hi, right?

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Normally you would use it to get somebody's attention, right?

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Like, hey, I'm over here.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey, waiter.

212
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay, yeah.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But in this case, like, hey, how's it going?

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Or hi.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, so it's a really friendly and informal way of saying hi.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, and then he asked, how's it going?

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How's it going?

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So again, this is a way of saying, how are you?

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, Marco, what's the correct answer to this greeting?

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Well, well, for example, he said things are going great, right?

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can say, yeah, things are great, or I'm doing well.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or even great, you know, great.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah.

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So how's it going?

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, it's great.

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Right.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Now, another one that we didn't see in the dialogue, but it's very popular is when somebody asks, hey, what's up?

229
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, what's up?

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So again, what is the right way to answer this question?

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All right.

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So when somebody says, what's up?

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can say, well, not much.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Or if maybe you have news or something that you want to share, you would say, well, I just got back from the doctor's office.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Right.

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But you wouldn't say fine, thank you.

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Or you wouldn't say very good or any of these other common answers to what's up.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It can be a little bit tricky.

239
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So the rule is the normal thing to say when someone says, hey, what's up?

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is nothing much.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Not much.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000
All right.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So interesting ways of greeting casually with people, right?

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You wouldn't use this for with your boss, maybe, or in an office setting?

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
More, more useful with your friends.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
OK.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000

Bye.
