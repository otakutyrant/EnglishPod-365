00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,000
EnglishPod.com Take the theory of the Big Bang.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back, or African myths about turtles and stuff.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Turtles?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Whatever.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and antiparticles.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
At least, that's what the math says.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Math shmath!

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's the evidence?

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There is evidence.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What would it be expanding from?

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Anyway, it's just a theory.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why do people go around touting theories?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Where's the rigor in that?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dude, don't equivocate.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding, rigorous testing.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You slept through class, didn't you?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're making my head hurt again.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Quit with the questions.
