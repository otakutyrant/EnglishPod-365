00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,579
EnglishPod.com Take the theory of the Big Bang.

2
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,560
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,140
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back, or African myths about turtles and stuff.

4
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:41,820
Turtles?

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,340
Whatever.

6
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,579
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and antiparticles.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,159
At least, that's what the math says.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,340
Math shmath!

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,219
What's the evidence?

10
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:52,759
There is evidence.

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:02,439
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

12
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,500
What would it be expanding from?

13
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,340
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

14
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,480
Anyway, it's just a theory.

15
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,519
Why do people go around touting theories?

16
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:12,180
Where's the rigor in that?

17
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,640
Dude, don't equivocate.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,400
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding, rigorous testing.

19
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:19,200
You slept through class, didn't you?

20
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,340
You're making my head hurt again.

21
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,420
Quit with the questions.
