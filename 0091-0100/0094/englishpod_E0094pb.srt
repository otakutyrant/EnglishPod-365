00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,219
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,900
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,279
And today we're going to be talking about physics.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:20,239
That's right, an advanced lesson for all you physics lovers out there, and even for those of you who maybe don't love physics so much, there's still some great language here.

6
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:30,160
Right, we're going to be talking about the Big Bang Theory, a very popular theory of how the universe or the world and how we came upon being created.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:39,299
That's right, so we've got some physics language, but we've also got some really tough words that I bet many of our users have never seen before, which we're going to look at those in this lesson.

8
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:46,320
All right, so why don't we get started with this great and interesting lesson, and let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,219
What's up?

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:53,320
What's up?

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,060
You don't look too good.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,939
Yeah, my head hurts.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,500
That's all.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,280
I've been in physics class all day.

15
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:58,859
It's killer.

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,439
I liked physics.

17
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:01,460
It's all math, really.

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,780
Arcs, curves, velocity.

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,320
Cool stuff.

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,079
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,579
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

22
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,480
A physics class about the creation of the universe?

23
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,519
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,859
It sounds more religious to me.

25
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,900
It's all religion.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,000
Take the theory of the Big Bang.

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,980
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,540
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back, or African myths about turtles and stuff.

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,239
Turtles?

30
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:26,739
Whatever.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,980
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and antiparticles.

32
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,579
At least, that's what the math says.

33
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,140
Math?

34
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,760
Shmath?

35
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,640
What's the evidence?

36
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,180
There is evidence.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:46,879
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

38
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,939
What would it be expanding from?

39
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:51,060
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

40
00:01:51,459 --> 00:01:52,900
Anyway, it's just a theory.

41
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,920
Why do people go around touting theories?

42
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,599
Where's the rigor in that?

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,060
Dude, don't equivocate.

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,799
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing.

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,599
You slept through class, didn't you?

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,760
You're making my head hurt again.

47
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:06,840
Quit with the questions.

48
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,599
Well it sure does sound like a difficult class, doesn't it?

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,280
It's a very interesting topic and very controversial, so there are many opinions on it.

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:28,060
But before we get into that, why don't we take a look at some of those physics-related words that we listen to in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,960
We've got four words we've heard in the dialogue that are all related to physics, so let's start with the first one, which is matter.

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:39,819
Matter.

53
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,659
Matter.

54
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,379
Okay, so you probably know this word from What's the Matter?

55
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,039
What's Wrong?

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,800
In this case, we're talking about matter, so anything that occupies space, that has a mass or that is related to energy.

57
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:53,539
So matter.

58
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,759
So all things in the world are made up of matter, right?

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,259
Exactly.

60
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,159
Okay.

61
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,479
Now let's move on to another one.

62
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,819
Particles.

63
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,539
Particles.

64
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,479
Particles.

65
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,300
Now particles are a little bit more...

66
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,000
Now particles are a little bit easier.

67
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,340
They're just very small pieces of a whole.

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,120
An apple is made up of apple particles?

69
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,039
Something like that.

70
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,979
If you want to understand it easily, yeah, an apple has many small particles that make up the apple.

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,360
So like, let's paint a picture here.

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,780
Imagine we've got a beach, and all the pieces of sand are particles of the beach.

73
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,319
Exactly.

74
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:30,120
Very good.

75
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,780
So those are particles.

76
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,900
Now the next one is a little bit difficult for me, I don't understand this.

77
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,000
Antiparticles.

78
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,740
Alright, so antiparticles.

79
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,560
Antiparticles.

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,860
Now this prefix, anti, it means something that is against, right?

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,300
Right.

82
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,680
And I've seen this one in anti-clockwise.

83
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,300
Alright so antiparticles are those that are against particles.

84
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:07,199
So basically if you have a particle that has a positive charge, and another one comes in with a negative charge in the same weight and the same type of particle, if they get together, they cancel each other out and they both die.

85
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh.

86
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
So that's an antiparticle.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,180
Alright well, you heard it first here at EnglishPod.

88
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,740
So antiparticles are not a good thing to have around.

89
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,819
Now we also heard them talk about the drift of matter.

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,060
Right, drift of matter.

91
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,199
Drift of matter.

92
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,220
Also sometimes called drift of dark matter.

93
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,980
Okay well I know the verb to drift, right?

94
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,420
To sort of float away on the sea.

95
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,759
Right, if you have a little ship, you leave it on the beach, it'll drift away.

96
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,040
It'll go slowly away.

97
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,079
But what about drift of matter?

98
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:46,959
So basically the drift of matter is this residue, the remains of the big bang, of the explosion.

99
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:52,839
So matter and radiation keeps on drifting through the universe.

100
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:54,560
So it's moving slowly through the universe.

101
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,180
Moving slowly.

102
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:01,180
So this big explosion, and just consider it to be like this ripple, and it's expanding and expanding.

103
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,300
That's the drift of matter.

104
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,160
Alright well, I learned something else today.

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,519
Some very specific words related to physics, but it's very interesting.

106
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,399
Once you get into reading about these things, it will help you to understand it better.

107
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,079
That's right.

108
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,519
But we've also got some non-physics related language that we want to look at now in Language Takeaway, Part 2.

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,540
So they were talking about the drift of matter, and how it's drifting through the universe.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,579
And then he said, thus advancing the notions of an expanding universe.

111
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,600
So I want to look at the phrase, thus advancing notions.

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,980
Thus advancing notions.

113
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,240
Okay, let's start with the first word here.

114
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,740
Thus.

115
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,939
Okay, so this is a good connector.

116
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:51,060
Our conjunction.

117
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:51,819
Our conjunction.

118
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,040
And basically it means therefore.

119
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,240
Therefore or in consequence, right?

120
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,879
So thus advancing notions.

121
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,019
Now notions are ideas.

122
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:01,879
Right.

123
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,980
And so when you advance notions or advance ideas, you help them make progress.

124
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,579
You help them go forward and become known.

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,839
So in order to understand this in the context, they are saying that the drift of matter thus advances notions of an expanding universe.

126
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,959
So it is making progress to people believing that the universe is getting bigger.

127
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, so interesting phrase.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,660
Now, I really like this word thus, and a lot of people are afraid to use it.

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,439
So why don't we hear a few examples of how it's used in context.

130
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,800
Example 1.

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,639
So you can see that we've studied the fossil record, and thus we can conclude that evolution is a fact.

132
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,620
Example 2.

133
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,240
He broke severe company policies, thus we had to fire him.

134
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,620
Example 3.

135
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,579
I did not receive the documents on time, thus I was unable to send them to you.

136
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,079
Alright, good examples of thus, and I guess now we can use it a little bit better.

137
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:12,560
That's right.

138
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,920
Now let's move on to our next word.

139
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,620
So they were talking about people who go around touting theories.

140
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,560
Tout.

141
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,040
To tout.

142
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,279
Okay, so what does this mean, tout?

143
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:33,540
Well basically, when you tout something, you talk about it in a positive way, so as to almost like sell that thing.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,139
Okay.

145
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,720
So for example, we can say, the company is touting the many benefits of its product.

146
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,759
Okay, very good.

147
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,740
So to talk positively about something.

148
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,019
Yeah, with the idea of trying to sell that thing, or make people buy into it or believe it.

149
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,120
Alright, very good.

150
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,980
What about our next word?

151
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,079
Well we heard two related words in the dialogue.

152
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:59,759
They were talking about where's the rigor in these theories, and rigorous testing.

153
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,540
Okay, so what's the difference between rigor and rigorous?

154
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,000
Rigor is the state of being very clear and careful and exact.

155
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:07,879
Okay.

156
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,959
And rigorous is just the adjective.

157
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:14,680
Clear, careful, attention to detail, and exact.

158
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,060
Okay, very good.

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,839
So rigorous training.

160
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm going over my notes in rigorous detail.

161
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,779
Okay, very good.

162
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,959
And now we have one more word today in Language Takeaway, and that is equivocate.

163
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,160
So we heard dude, don't equivocate.

164
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,860
Don't equivocate.

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,980
Don't equivocate.

166
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,320
Alright, so what does he mean by this?

167
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,100
Well when you equivocate, you use big words to try and mislead somebody.

168
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,200
Okay, so using big words to confuse or to mislead.

169
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,740
Yep, so for example we could say, when asked about his experience, the job candidate equivocated.

170
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:57,759
Okay.

171
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,720
Or even the presidential nominee did not equivocate when he explained his tax policy.

172
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:10,899
Alright, so some good examples, good phrases, a lot of interesting stuff, and a little bit more educational podcast today.

173
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:15,379
That's right, so let's continue with our education by listening to the dialogue one last time.

174
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:23,580
What's up?

175
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:24,440
You don't look too good.

176
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,840
Yeah, my head hurts, that's all.

177
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,639
I've been in physics class all day.

178
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,240
It's killer.

179
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:30,840
I liked physics.

180
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:31,820
It's all math really.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,679
Arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.

182
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,480
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,940
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

184
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,840
A physics class about the creation of the universe?

185
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:42,879
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

186
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,200
Sounds more religious to me.

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,240
It's all religion.

188
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,360
Take the theory of the Big Bang.

189
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,320
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

190
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,879
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back, or African myths about turtles and stuff.

191
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,600
Turtles?

192
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,100
Whatever.

193
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,399
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and anti-particles.

194
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,940
At least, that's what the math says.

195
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,120
Math shmath!

196
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,000
What's the evidence?

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,559
There is evidence.

198
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:17,220
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,279
What would it be expanding from?

200
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,220
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

201
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,259
Anyway, it's just a theory.

202
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,299
Why do people go around touting theories?

203
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,960
Where's the rigor in that?

204
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,419
Dude, don't equivocate.

205
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,159
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding, rigorous testing.

206
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:33,980
You slept through class, didn't you?

207
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,100
Ugh, you're making my head hurt again.

208
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:37,220
Quit with the question.

209
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,100
Alright, so the Big Bang theory, very controversial.

210
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,779
In some schools in the United States, they have prohibited the teachers from teaching it.

211
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:58,940
I know, which seems quite interesting to me, but it is actually very controversial and people can get really, really upset about this in America.

212
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,039
So it is an interesting topic.

213
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:08,919
Take it from the point of view of just something else, maybe just to learn a little bit more about this topic such as physics, right?

214
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Right.

215
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,779
But there's something that is uncontroversial that I did want to talk about now that we heard in the dialogue.

216
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,379
There's a lot of really interesting sort of slang words here in the dialogue, isn't there?

217
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,919
Yeah, we heard in the first part of the dialogue when he said, I've been in physics class all day.

218
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,580
Killer.

219
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:26,399
Killer?

220
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,000
So what does he mean by killer?

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,559
Oh, he's just basically saying it's really hard.

222
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,100
You know, it's like it's so difficult that it's murderous.

223
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,159
It was intense.

224
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:34,559
Yep.

225
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,179
But this word we can use positively as well, can't we?

226
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,279
Yeah, I guess you could say that was a killer party.

227
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,100
Yeah, killer moves on the dance floor.

228
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,659
Okay.

229
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,820
Another interesting thing is that he said math, schmath.

230
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,620
Now, schmath isn't really a word.

231
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:54,679
No, but this is a really common structure we use in English when we want to sort of take away from the importance of an idea.

232
00:11:54,679 --> 00:12:00,320
Okay, so you're saying it's not important, I don't care about it, or it's not worth it.

233
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,279
Yeah, so for example, I'm on a diet.

234
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,399
Right, and I would say diet schmiet.

235
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:04,860
Yeah.

236
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,019
So basically the structure is just add an S-H and then just kind of make it rhyme.

237
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,680
Schmiet or like...

238
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,539
Like work schmerk.

239
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,679
Yeah, work schmerk or something like that.

240
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:16,860
Yeah.

241
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,320
So you're just making fun of it and you're taking away importance.

242
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,580
Yeah, that's a pretty neat phrase.

243
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,360
And one more, we heard them say duh.

244
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,299
Duh.

245
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,559
So when we say this, we're just saying like, you should know this, stupid.

246
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,860
Yeah, this is obvious.

247
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah.

248
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:38,299
It's kind of making fun of the person or just saying it's so obvious, how can you not know it?

249
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:38,500
Yeah.

250
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,559
And it always goes either at the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

251
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,340
Yeah, so duh, Marco, we're recording a podcast.

252
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:45,919
Right.

253
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,059
Very good.

254
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:53,220
So some great words and phrases in this dialogue and a little bit of slang as well so you can use it maybe with your friends.

255
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,720
That's right.

256
00:12:54,259 --> 00:13:02,700

257
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,500
Alright, we'll see you guys there and until next time, goodbye.
