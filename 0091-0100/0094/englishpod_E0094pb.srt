00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be talking about physics.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right, an advanced lesson for all you physics lovers out there, and even for those of you who maybe don't love physics so much, there's still some great language here.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Right, we're going to be talking about the Big Bang Theory, a very popular theory of how the universe or the world and how we came upon being created.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right, so we've got some physics language, but we've also got some really tough words that I bet many of our users have never seen before, which we're going to look at those in this lesson.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
All right, so why don't we get started with this great and interesting lesson, and let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's up?

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's up?

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't look too good.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, my head hurts.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's all.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've been in physics class all day.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's killer.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I liked physics.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's all math, really.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Arcs, curves, velocity.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Cool stuff.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A physics class about the creation of the universe?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It sounds more religious to me.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's all religion.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Take the theory of the Big Bang.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back, or African myths about turtles and stuff.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Turtles?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Whatever.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and antiparticles.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
At least, that's what the math says.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Math?

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Shmath?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's the evidence?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There is evidence.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What would it be expanding from?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Anyway, it's just a theory.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why do people go around touting theories?

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where's the rigor in that?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Dude, don't equivocate.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You slept through class, didn't you?

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're making my head hurt again.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Quit with the questions.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well it sure does sound like a difficult class, doesn't it?

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a very interesting topic and very controversial, so there are many opinions on it.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But before we get into that, why don't we take a look at some of those physics-related words that we listen to in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We've got four words we've heard in the dialogue that are all related to physics, so let's start with the first one, which is matter.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Matter.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Matter.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, so you probably know this word from What's the Matter?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What's Wrong?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In this case, we're talking about matter, so anything that occupies space, that has a mass or that is related to energy.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So matter.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So all things in the world are made up of matter, right?

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Exactly.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now let's move on to another one.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Particles.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Particles.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Particles.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now particles are a little bit more...

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now particles are a little bit easier.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They're just very small pieces of a whole.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
An apple is made up of apple particles?

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Something like that.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you want to understand it easily, yeah, an apple has many small particles that make up the apple.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So like, let's paint a picture here.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Imagine we've got a beach, and all the pieces of sand are particles of the beach.

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Exactly.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Very good.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So those are particles.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Now the next one is a little bit difficult for me, I don't understand this.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Antiparticles.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Alright, so antiparticles.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Antiparticles.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now this prefix, anti, it means something that is against, right?

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I've seen this one in anti-clockwise.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Alright so antiparticles are those that are against particles.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So basically if you have a particle that has a positive charge, and another one comes in with a negative charge in the same weight and the same type of particle, if they get together, they cancel each other out and they both die.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So that's an antiparticle.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Alright well, you heard it first here at EnglishPod.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So antiparticles are not a good thing to have around.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now we also heard them talk about the drift of matter.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right, drift of matter.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Drift of matter.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Also sometimes called drift of dark matter.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay well I know the verb to drift, right?

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
To sort of float away on the sea.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Right, if you have a little ship, you leave it on the beach, it'll drift away.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It'll go slowly away.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But what about drift of matter?

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So basically the drift of matter is this residue, the remains of the big bang, of the explosion.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So matter and radiation keeps on drifting through the universe.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So it's moving slowly through the universe.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Moving slowly.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So this big explosion, and just consider it to be like this ripple, and it's expanding and expanding.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's the drift of matter.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Alright well, I learned something else today.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Some very specific words related to physics, but it's very interesting.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Once you get into reading about these things, it will help you to understand it better.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But we've also got some non-physics related language that we want to look at now in Language Takeaway, Part 2.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So they were talking about the drift of matter, and how it's drifting through the universe.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And then he said, thus advancing the notions of an expanding universe.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So I want to look at the phrase, thus advancing notions.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thus advancing notions.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, let's start with the first word here.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thus.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, so this is a good connector.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Our conjunction.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Our conjunction.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And basically it means therefore.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Therefore or in consequence, right?

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So thus advancing notions.

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now notions are ideas.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Right.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And so when you advance notions or advance ideas, you help them make progress.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You help them go forward and become known.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So in order to understand this in the context, they are saying that the drift of matter thus advances notions of an expanding universe.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So it is making progress to people believing that the universe is getting bigger.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, so interesting phrase.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now, I really like this word thus, and a lot of people are afraid to use it.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So why don't we hear a few examples of how it's used in context.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Example 1.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So you can see that we've studied the fossil record, and thus we can conclude that evolution is a fact.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Example 2.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He broke severe company policies, thus we had to fire him.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Example 3.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I did not receive the documents on time, thus I was unable to send them to you.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Alright, good examples of thus, and I guess now we can use it a little bit better.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's right.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now let's move on to our next word.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So they were talking about people who go around touting theories.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Tout.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To tout.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, so what does this mean, tout?

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well basically, when you tout something, you talk about it in a positive way, so as to almost like sell that thing.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So for example, we can say, the company is touting the many benefits of its product.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, very good.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So to talk positively about something.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, with the idea of trying to sell that thing, or make people buy into it or believe it.

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Alright, very good.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What about our next word?

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well we heard two related words in the dialogue.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They were talking about where's the rigor in these theories, and rigorous testing.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay, so what's the difference between rigor and rigorous?

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Rigor is the state of being very clear and careful and exact.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And rigorous is just the adjective.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Clear, careful, attention to detail, and exact.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, very good.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So rigorous training.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm going over my notes in rigorous detail.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, very good.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And now we have one more word today in Language Takeaway, and that is equivocate.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So we heard dude, don't equivocate.

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't equivocate.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't equivocate.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Alright, so what does he mean by this?

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well when you equivocate, you use big words to try and mislead somebody.

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay, so using big words to confuse or to mislead.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yep, so for example we could say, when asked about his experience, the job candidate equivocated.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or even the presidential nominee did not equivocate when he explained his tax policy.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Alright, so some good examples, good phrases, a lot of interesting stuff, and a little bit more educational podcast today.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's right, so let's continue with our education by listening to the dialogue one last time.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What's up?

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You don't look too good.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, my head hurts, that's all.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I've been in physics class all day.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's killer.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I liked physics.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's all math really.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But today's lesson was all about the creation of the universe.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
A physics class about the creation of the universe?

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's some pretty unscientific language there.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sounds more religious to me.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's all religion.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Take the theory of the Big Bang.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion?

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back, or African myths about turtles and stuff.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Turtles?

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Whatever.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Look, all that's required for the creation of matter is an imbalance of particles and anti-particles.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
At least, that's what the math says.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Math shmath!

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What's the evidence?

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There is evidence.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You know Edwin Hubble, the guy who in the early 20th century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What would it be expanding from?

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, the Big Bang, duh.

201
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Anyway, it's just a theory.

202
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why do people go around touting theories?

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Where's the rigor in that?

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Dude, don't equivocate.

205
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding, rigorous testing.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You slept through class, didn't you?

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ugh, you're making my head hurt again.

208
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Quit with the question.

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Alright, so the Big Bang theory, very controversial.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
In some schools in the United States, they have prohibited the teachers from teaching it.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I know, which seems quite interesting to me, but it is actually very controversial and people can get really, really upset about this in America.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So it is an interesting topic.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Take it from the point of view of just something else, maybe just to learn a little bit more about this topic such as physics, right?

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Right.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But there's something that is uncontroversial that I did want to talk about now that we heard in the dialogue.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There's a lot of really interesting sort of slang words here in the dialogue, isn't there?

217
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, we heard in the first part of the dialogue when he said, I've been in physics class all day.

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Killer.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Killer?

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So what does he mean by killer?

221
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, he's just basically saying it's really hard.

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You know, it's like it's so difficult that it's murderous.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was intense.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yep.

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But this word we can use positively as well, can't we?

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I guess you could say that was a killer party.

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah, killer moves on the dance floor.

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Another interesting thing is that he said math, schmath.

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Now, schmath isn't really a word.

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, but this is a really common structure we use in English when we want to sort of take away from the importance of an idea.

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay, so you're saying it's not important, I don't care about it, or it's not worth it.

233
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah, so for example, I'm on a diet.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Right, and I would say diet schmiet.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So basically the structure is just add an S-H and then just kind of make it rhyme.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Schmiet or like...

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like work schmerk.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, work schmerk or something like that.

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So you're just making fun of it and you're taking away importance.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah, that's a pretty neat phrase.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And one more, we heard them say duh.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Duh.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So when we say this, we're just saying like, you should know this, stupid.

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah, this is obvious.

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yeah.

248
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's kind of making fun of the person or just saying it's so obvious, how can you not know it?

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah.

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it always goes either at the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, so duh, Marco, we're recording a podcast.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Right.

253
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Very good.

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So some great words and phrases in this dialogue and a little bit of slang as well so you can use it maybe with your friends.

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's right.

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000

257
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Alright, we'll see you guys there and until next time, goodbye.
