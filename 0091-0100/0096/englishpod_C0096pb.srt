00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we are going back in time again, and this time we're going to be in the 1960s.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're going to learn some phrases and some slang that were really popular back in 1964.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And most of these phrases and words we still use today, so it's very interesting and very good to know.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm looking forward to this trip back in time, so why don't we get started with the dialogue.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey man, I really like your pad.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Those lava lamps are far out.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's no problem, brother.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music, and just hang loose.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You dig what I'm saying?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I dig it, man.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We should throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, man.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That would be groovy.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey, I gotta split for a while.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you okay here by yourself?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't worry about me, brother.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can take care of your business.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Peace out.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All right, so great dialogue.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Very popular in the 60s, the music, the mood, and the words, right?

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So why don't we get down to business and look at the vocabulary that we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, the dialogue opened, and we heard this guy say, hey man, I really like your pad.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I really like your pad.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Pad.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, so pad, a very informal way of saying?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your apartment.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Your apartment, right?

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And now you can still use it today.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, that's right.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We often hear the expression bachelor pad.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, a bachelor pad.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So that's an apartment where a single man lives.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, so a bachelor pad.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Usually it's very nicely decorated and really a nice apartment, right?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Or maybe it has empty pizza boxes all over the floor, Marco.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Also a bachelor pad.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But so that's what pad means, an apartment.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They were talking about the apartment, and he said the lava lamps are far out.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Far out.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, it's far out.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So that's really cool or amazing.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And now lava lamps, those are those strange cone looking lamps, right?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Kind of a light with like some liquid moving inside.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Moving inside.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Very popular in the 60s.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, we'll post some pictures of that.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, and the lamps are far out.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So now you can use that with other things, right?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Like you are really far out.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, or this music is really far out.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It kind of gives you the feeling like it's sort of spacey.

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Spacey.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright, so the pad is really far out.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The lava lamps are great.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And he was saying, thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
To crash.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So to crash at someone's place.

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Right.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So we're not talking about like a car crash here.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No, no, no.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But so when you crash somewhere, what do you do?

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well, you are staying there, then you're going to stay there.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So you're as a guest.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So like sleep, right?

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Uh huh.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yep.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And for free.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
For free.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So if, for example, you're going to New York and you're going to visit a friend, you might crash at your friend's house.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So interesting word.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And it is quite commonly used now.

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So why don't we hear some examples of how we can use it.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Example one.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hey, man, can I crash at your place tonight?

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Example two.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I lost my keys.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I'm crashing at my girlfriend's house.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Example three.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, you've been sleeping on my couch for a month.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're not going to crash here tonight.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Perfect.

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So to crash.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's still commonly used today.

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now for the fourth word.

105
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Groovy.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Groovy.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That would be groovy.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So again, this means like great or cool or really nice.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, this is I think this is one of the main words of the 1960s.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Something was groovy.

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, I But in a relaxed way.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, it's groovy.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This music is really groovy.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And finally, his friend, he said, Hey, I got a split for a while to split.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So if I say I have to split, you have to leave.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have to leave.

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

120
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Very colloquial.

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And it means I have to leave for a little bit.

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Split for a while.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's right.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You may not have heard this one before.

125
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So why don't we hear some examples to help you understand how it's used.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Example one.

127
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hurry up.

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We've got a split before the police get here.

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Example two.

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This party is boring.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's split.

132
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Example three.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So we're going to split.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, very good.

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So split.

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Now also, I think you can use it for relationships, right?

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Me and him.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Me and her split up.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So you ended your relationship split.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, so we we saw five really common phrases from the 1960s.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again a little bit slower.

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases from the 60s.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hey, man, I really like your pad.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Those lava lamps are far out.

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's no problem, brother.

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You dig what I'm saying?

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I dig it, man.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We could throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, man, that would be groovy.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey, I got a split for a while.

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you okay here by yourself?

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't worry about me, brother.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You go take care of your business.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Peace out.

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right, well, I want to get started at looking at these 1960s slang phrases.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So let's go now with putting it together.

162
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Putting it together.

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All right, I'm putting it together today.

164
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's start with the first part.

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He talked about you dig what I'm saying?

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I dig it, man.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You dig what I'm saying?

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
To dig it.

169
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
All right, so we know the verb dig, which means to make a hole, right?

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah.

171
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But now he's talking about understand.

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, basically, you dig what I'm saying?

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And when he says I dig it, he says I understand.

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now, there's also another meaning to this, right?

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Apart from understand.

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, it can also mean I like it.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, so I really dig this type of music or I really dig this restaurant.

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay, so it's kind of I like it.

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right.

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now moving on.

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He said we could throw a bash here.

185
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
All right, throw a bash to throw a bash.

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So first of all, what is a bash?

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A bash is a party, a really great party, an amazing party.

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now I want to look at this verb to throw something.

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we know that you throw a ball, right?

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But how can you throw a party?

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, it's basically saying you organize or you host a party.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And how can you use this phrase?

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, so I can say last week, I threw a birthday party in my house.

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Or let's throw a bash to celebrate your engagement.

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Or next week, I'm going to throw a dinner party at my house.

200
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay, so to throw a party and it's usually used for for parties, right?

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You wouldn't throw a throw a meeting.

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right.

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, so now we heard them use the word man a lot, right?

204
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hey, man.

205
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now, this is so common, even in modern English that I think we need some examples.

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Example one.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey, man, watch where you're going.

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Example two.

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, man, that's a great idea.

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Example three.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Man, that was awesome.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So man is one of those words that you just use at the end of your sentences, or the beginning or the beginning anywhere.

214
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so you say, Hey, man, or Yeah, man.

215
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But what about do you have to be a man to use it?

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Or do you have to be talking to a man to use it?

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No, not really.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Men and women use the word man.

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah.

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And you can call a girl like, Hey, man, how are you?

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, but that sort of means that she's a really, really good friend, like the same level of friend as your guy friend.

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay, very good.

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And now for the last phrase, I'm putting it together.

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He said, you go take care of business to take care of business.

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, so I have to take care of business.

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So we're not really talking about business and work here.

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No, no, no, no.

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So basically, what we're saying is, go handle your affairs.

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So do the things you have to do.

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, so or solve your problem.

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So if I say I have to go to City Hall today and take care of some business, so you're maybe gonna do something like pay my taxes or something like that.

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay, so to take care of business.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, so we heard some great phrases.

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We saw these words.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And then we'll come back and talk about this great decade.

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hey, man, I really like your pad.

241
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Those lava lamps are far out.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's no problem, brother.

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I wanted a pad where people could come listen to music and just hang loose.

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You dig what I'm saying?

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I dig it, man.

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We should throw a bash here and make it really happening scene.

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, man, that would be groovy.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hey, I got a split for a while.

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you okay here by yourself?

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't worry about me, brother.

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You go take care of your business.

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
All right, peace out.

254
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All right, so 1960s, very famous among rock music, the peace and conflicts and all this stuff.

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, that's right.

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I guess in English or Anglo pop culture, we look back at this decade very fondly.

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah.

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And also we really relate it to the hippie movement.

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
People with long hair and baggy clothes, you know, living in their cars, going from concert to concert.

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I mean, speaking of music, I think if we think 1960s, at least in Anglo world, in the Anglo world, we think of the best music.

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Like, I think this is the golden age of music in English speaking countries.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, it was a very good era.

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And well, what do you guys think?

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you think the 60s was the best decade?

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Or maybe you are more fond of the 70s, the disco era?

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Or even the 90s.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's some pretty good music in 1994.

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Exactly.

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
