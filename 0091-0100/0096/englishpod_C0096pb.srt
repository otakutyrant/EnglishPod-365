00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,500
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,299
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,259
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,580
And today we are going back in time again, and this time we're going to be in the 1960s.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,199
That's right.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:22,600
We're going to learn some phrases and some slang that were really popular back in 1964.

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,120
Exactly.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,160
And most of these phrases and words we still use today, so it's very interesting and very good to know.

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:29,739
That's right.

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,859
I'm looking forward to this trip back in time, so why don't we get started with the dialogue.

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,100
Hey man, I really like your pad.

13
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:48,000
Those lava lamps are far out.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,979
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,600
It's no problem, brother.

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,060
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music, and just hang loose.

17
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,240
You dig what I'm saying?

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
I dig it, man.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We should throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,619
Yeah, man.

21
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,939
That would be groovy.

22
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,180
Hey, I gotta split for a while.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,500
Are you okay here by yourself?

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,099
Don't worry about me, brother.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,040
You can take care of your business.

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:12,620
All right.

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,159
Peace out.

28
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,799
All right, so great dialogue.

29
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:24,599
Very popular in the 60s, the music, the mood, and the words, right?

30
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,400
That's right.

31
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:31,060
So why don't we get down to business and look at the vocabulary that we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:40,340
Well, the dialogue opened, and we heard this guy say, hey man, I really like your pad.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,500
I really like your pad.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Pad.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,040
Okay, so pad, a very informal way of saying?

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,959
Your apartment.

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,400
Your apartment, right?

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,760
And now you can still use it today.

39
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:52,799
Yeah, that's right.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,739
We often hear the expression bachelor pad.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,319
Okay, a bachelor pad.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,079
So that's an apartment where a single man lives.

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,379
Okay, so a bachelor pad.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,280
Usually it's very nicely decorated and really a nice apartment, right?

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,240
Or maybe it has empty pizza boxes all over the floor, Marco.

46
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,539
Also a bachelor pad.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
But so that's what pad means, an apartment.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,139
Yeah.

49
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:20,740
They were talking about the apartment, and he said the lava lamps are far out.

50
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:21,860
Far out.

51
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,960
Okay, it's far out.

52
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,599
So that's really cool or amazing.

53
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:28,259
Right.

54
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,659
And now lava lamps, those are those strange cone looking lamps, right?

55
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,520
Kind of a light with like some liquid moving inside.

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,939
Moving inside.

57
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:38,460
Very popular in the 60s.

58
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,759
Yeah, we'll post some pictures of that.

59
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,939
Yeah, and the lamps are far out.

60
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,020
So now you can use that with other things, right?

61
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,319
Like you are really far out.

62
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,659
Yeah, or this music is really far out.

63
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,020
Okay.

64
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,120
It kind of gives you the feeling like it's sort of spacey.

65
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:52,740
Spacey.

66
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,020
Yeah.

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,479
Alright, so the pad is really far out.

68
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,699
The lava lamps are great.

69
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:01,039
And he was saying, thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

70
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,159
To crash.

71
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,060
So to crash at someone's place.

72
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:05,400
Right.

73
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,520
So we're not talking about like a car crash here.

74
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,340
No, no, no.

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,039
But so when you crash somewhere, what do you do?

76
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:15,219
Well, you are staying there, then you're going to stay there.

77
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,139
So you're as a guest.

78
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,379
Yeah.

79
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,439
So like sleep, right?

80
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,759
Uh huh.

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,120
Yep.

82
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:18,860
And for free.

83
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,620
For free.

84
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:19,939
Yes.

85
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,840
So if, for example, you're going to New York and you're going to visit a friend, you might crash at your friend's house.

86
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,460
That's right.

87
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,120
So interesting word.

88
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,340
And it is quite commonly used now.

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,580
So why don't we hear some examples of how we can use it.

90
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,280
Example one.

91
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,939
Hey, man, can I crash at your place tonight?

92
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,719
Example two.

93
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,159
I lost my keys.

94
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,819
So I'm crashing at my girlfriend's house.

95
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,020
Example three.

96
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,659
No, you've been sleeping on my couch for a month.

97
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,360
You're not going to crash here tonight.

98
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,919
All right.

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,340
Perfect.

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,800
So to crash.

101
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,139
Right.

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,479
It's still commonly used today.

103
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:01,800
Yeah.

104
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,199
Now for the fourth word.

105
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,719
Groovy.

106
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,780
Groovy.

107
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,039
That would be groovy.

108
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,860
So again, this means like great or cool or really nice.

109
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,899
Yeah, this is I think this is one of the main words of the 1960s.

110
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,980
Something was groovy.

111
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Yes, I But in a relaxed way.

112
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,519
Yeah, it's groovy.

113
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,639
This music is really groovy.

114
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,160
That's right.

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,579
And finally, his friend, he said, Hey, I got a split for a while to split.

116
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,339
Okay.

117
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:39,519
So if I say I have to split, you have to leave.

118
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,759
I have to leave.

119
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,060
Yeah.

120
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,279
Very colloquial.

121
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,899
And it means I have to leave for a little bit.

122
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,079
Split for a while.

123
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:46,720
That's right.

124
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,500
You may not have heard this one before.

125
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,980
So why don't we hear some examples to help you understand how it's used.

126
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,500
Example one.

127
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,720
Hurry up.

128
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,819
We've got a split before the police get here.

129
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,420
Example two.

130
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,500
This party is boring.

131
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,519
Let's split.

132
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,639
Example three.

133
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,199
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

134
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,420
So we're going to split.

135
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,060
Okay, very good.

136
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,959
So split.

137
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,720
Now also, I think you can use it for relationships, right?

138
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:30,540
Me and him.

139
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:32,740
Me and her split up.

140
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:33,240
That's right.

141
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,319
So you ended your relationship split.

142
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,740
Okay, so we we saw five really common phrases from the 1960s.

143
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,019
Let's listen to the dialogue again a little bit slower.

144
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,600
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases from the 60s.

145
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,060
Hey, man, I really like your pad.

146
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,199
Those lava lamps are far out.

147
00:05:57,579 --> 00:05:59,100
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

148
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,160
It's no problem, brother.

149
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,199
I wanted a pad where people could come, listen to music and just hang loose.

150
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,639
You dig what I'm saying?

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,980
I dig it, man.

152
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,480
We could throw a bash here and make it a really happening scene.

153
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,860
Yeah, man, that would be groovy.

154
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,819
Hey, I got a split for a while.

155
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,579
Are you okay here by yourself?

156
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:22,040
Don't worry about me, brother.

157
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,959
You go take care of your business.

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,939
All right.

159
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:25,920
Peace out.

160
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:36,899
All right, well, I want to get started at looking at these 1960s slang phrases.

161
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,300
So let's go now with putting it together.

162
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,399
Putting it together.

163
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,060
All right, I'm putting it together today.

164
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,879
Let's start with the first part.

165
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,480
He talked about you dig what I'm saying?

166
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
I dig it, man.

167
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,699
You dig what I'm saying?

168
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,819
To dig it.

169
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,639
All right, so we know the verb dig, which means to make a hole, right?

170
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:58,920
Yeah.

171
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:01,699
But now he's talking about understand.

172
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,899
Yeah, basically, you dig what I'm saying?

173
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,879
Do you understand what I'm saying?

174
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:09,819
And when he says I dig it, he says I understand.

175
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,240
Yeah.

176
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,180
Okay.

177
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,600
Now, there's also another meaning to this, right?

178
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,579
Apart from understand.

179
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,759
Yeah, it can also mean I like it.

180
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,180
Okay, so I really dig this type of music or I really dig this restaurant.

181
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,420
Okay, so it's kind of I like it.

182
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:25,579
All right.

183
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,120
Now moving on.

184
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,300
He said we could throw a bash here.

185
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:33,939
All right, throw a bash to throw a bash.

186
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,560
So first of all, what is a bash?

187
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:39,199
A bash is a party, a really great party, an amazing party.

188
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:43,519
Now I want to look at this verb to throw something.

189
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,399
So we know that you throw a ball, right?

190
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:46,740
Right.

191
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,699
But how can you throw a party?

192
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,939
Well, it's basically saying you organize or you host a party.

193
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:53,379
Okay.

194
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,560
And how can you use this phrase?

195
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,459
Okay, so I can say last week, I threw a birthday party in my house.

196
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:01,939
Okay.

197
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,560
Or let's throw a bash to celebrate your engagement.

198
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,420
Okay.

199
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,860
Or next week, I'm going to throw a dinner party at my house.

200
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay, so to throw a party and it's usually used for for parties, right?

201
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,600
You wouldn't throw a throw a meeting.

202
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,100
All right.

203
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,199
Okay, so now we heard them use the word man a lot, right?

204
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,060
Hey, man.

205
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,839
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,399
Now, this is so common, even in modern English that I think we need some examples.

207
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,419
Example one.

208
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,759
Hey, man, watch where you're going.

209
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,860
Example two.

210
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,340
Yeah, man, that's a great idea.

211
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,539
Example three.

212
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:50,879
Man, that was awesome.

213
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,740
So man is one of those words that you just use at the end of your sentences, or the beginning or the beginning anywhere.

214
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,679
And so you say, Hey, man, or Yeah, man.

215
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,259
But what about do you have to be a man to use it?

217
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,659
Or do you have to be talking to a man to use it?

218
00:09:08,659 --> 00:09:09,519
No, not really.

219
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,960
Men and women use the word man.

220
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:12,299
Yeah.

221
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,679
And you can call a girl like, Hey, man, how are you?

222
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,519
Yeah, but that sort of means that she's a really, really good friend, like the same level of friend as your guy friend.

223
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,139
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

224
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,860
Okay, very good.

225
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:29,279
And now for the last phrase, I'm putting it together.

226
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,919
He said, you go take care of business to take care of business.

227
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,759
Okay, so I have to take care of business.

228
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,360
So we're not really talking about business and work here.

229
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,320
No, no, no, no.

230
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,940
So basically, what we're saying is, go handle your affairs.

231
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,120
So do the things you have to do.

232
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,360
Okay, so or solve your problem.

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,600
So if I say I have to go to City Hall today and take care of some business, so you're maybe gonna do something like pay my taxes or something like that.

234
00:09:59,600 --> 00:09:59,799
Yeah.

235
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,759
Okay, so to take care of business.

236
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,519
Okay, so we heard some great phrases.

237
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:05,779
We saw these words.

238
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,320
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

239
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,500
And then we'll come back and talk about this great decade.

240
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,379
Hey, man, I really like your pad.

241
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,259
Those lava lamps are far out.

242
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,120
Thanks for letting me crash here tonight.

243
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,840
It's no problem, brother.

244
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,299
I wanted a pad where people could come listen to music and just hang loose.

245
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,480
You dig what I'm saying?

246
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,820
I dig it, man.

247
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,240
We should throw a bash here and make it really happening scene.

248
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,179
Yeah, man, that would be groovy.

249
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,419
Hey, I got a split for a while.

250
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,740
Are you okay here by yourself?

251
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,320
Don't worry about me, brother.

252
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,299
You go take care of your business.

253
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:46,700
All right, peace out.

254
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:58,840
All right, so 1960s, very famous among rock music, the peace and conflicts and all this stuff.

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,480
Yeah, that's right.

256
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:08,200
And I guess in English or Anglo pop culture, we look back at this decade very fondly.

257
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:08,659
Yeah.

258
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,120
And also we really relate it to the hippie movement.

259
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:19,740
People with long hair and baggy clothes, you know, living in their cars, going from concert to concert.

260
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,179
Yeah.

261
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:28,779
And I mean, speaking of music, I think if we think 1960s, at least in Anglo world, in the Anglo world, we think of the best music.

262
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,279
Like, I think this is the golden age of music in English speaking countries.

263
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,259
Yes, it was a very good era.

264
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:36,720
And well, what do you guys think?

265
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,879
Do you think the 60s was the best decade?

266
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,220
Or maybe you are more fond of the 70s, the disco era?

267
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,440
Or even the 90s.

268
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,440
There's some pretty good music in 1994.

269
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:46,519
Exactly.

00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,659
