00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome back to another lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we are going to have a very casual, normal conversation.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to listen in on some small talk between a taxi driver and the passenger.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Small talk.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So that's basically...

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Small, short conversations you have with someone that you don't know very well.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, so typical questions like how old are you, where you're from, etc.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And this can be really hard for English learners because they often don't know what the right thing to say or the right thing to talk about.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we're going to give you a lot of phrases in this lesson that you can use in small talk.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, so we don't have anything to preview today, so let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Where to, miss?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hi, Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sure thing.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So where are you flying in from?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
From China.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Really?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's fine.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am actually from Mexico.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wow, sounds interesting.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't get me wrong.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, thank you.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In that case, I am 26 years old.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And what about you yourself?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
of A.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Although I have some Colombian heritage.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Really?

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's great.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you speak Spanish?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Uh, yeah, of course.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
¿Qué bien?

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Entonces podemos hablar en español.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All right, so I don't think this guy spoke much Spanish, do you?

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, even though he has Colombian heritage, I think he doesn't speak much.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But maybe he's just a little bit rusty.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Maybe.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But what he does speak is English.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And since this is EnglishPod, why don't we take a look at some of the phrases that they used for Smalltalk and Fluency Builder.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, so today on Fluency Builder, we're going to take a look at phrases that both the passenger and the taxi driver used to make Smalltalk.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So why don't we start with the first one?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, so the taxi driver tells the passenger that she doesn't look very Chinese.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you don't mind me saying so.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Right, so he said, you don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you don't mind me saying so.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So what does he mean by this last part of his sentence?

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, this is a phrase that we use to soften a sort of statement that might be a little bit rude.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
She could be Chinese.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Right?

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So it may be a little bit rude to say that, but he kind of apologizes.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
By saying, if you don't mind me saying so.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay, so for example, I could say, hey Marco, you look a little tired today if you don't mind me saying so.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, so does it always go at the end?

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You could use it at the beginning.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you don't mind me saying so, I just don't think this is a good idea.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, very good.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So you can use this phrase in the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Right, and it makes your statement a little bit less rude.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you don't mind me saying so.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now again, he also apologizes a little bit when he says, Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy, but...

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but...

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but...

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, so let's take a look at this.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Nosy, what's this?

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, when somebody is nosy, it means they are very curious.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They are asking too many questions.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, asking more questions than they should ask.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Right.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So he apologizes and says, well, excuse me if I'm asking too many questions.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then he asks her another question.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He asks her how old she is.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So again, it's a polite way of maybe asking a question that might be a little bit sensitive.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, or a little bit impolite.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so of course, asking a woman her age maybe is a little bit impolite, right?

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes, typically women don't like that too much.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But our next phrase, we heard the taxi driver say, Don't get me wrong.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't get me wrong.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't get me wrong.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so don't get me wrong.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He says, well, don't misunderstand what I'm saying.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This phrase is used so commonly in English that I think it would help us to hear some examples.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't get me wrong.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not that I think you stole my computer.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just that you were the only one who could get into my room.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Example two.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I do have a few problems with the plan, but don't get me wrong.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I still think it's a good idea.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Example three.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't get me wrong.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think John's a nice guy.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He's just a bit disorganized.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right, very good example.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So don't get me wrong, right?

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And now for the final phrase on putting it together today.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, the passenger, the woman says her age.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She says, I'm 26 years old and what about yourself?

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What about yourself?

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What about yourself?

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All right, now this sentence isn't very correct actually, right?

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, technically it's not correct in grammar, but it is used so commonly every day by American English speakers that we thought we'd show it to you.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so you would say, I am 26 years old and what about you?

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, but commonly you will hear people say, what about yourself?

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And if you use this, you'll sound really fluent and really native-like.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, very good.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So what about yourself?

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So again, it's just like, what about you?

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I could say, hey Marco, I'm going away on holiday this weekend and what about yourself?

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, what about yourself?

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So we've taken a look at these four phrases on putting it together.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time?

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and take a look at some vocabulary words on language takeaway.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Music Where to miss?

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hi, Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Sure thing.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So, where are you flying in from?

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
From China.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's fine.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I am actually from Mexico.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wow, sounds interesting.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't get me wrong.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, thank you.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In that case, I am 26 years old and what about yourself?

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old US of A.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Although, I have some Colombian heritage.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really?

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's great.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Do you speak some Spanish?

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Uh, yeah.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Of course.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Que bien.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Entonces podemos hablar en español.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, we've got some interesting vocabulary words and phrases here in language takeaway.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the first one...

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, after she gets in the taxi and tells him where she wants to go, he answers by saying, Sure thing.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So, if I say, yeah, sure thing, what does that mean?

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Example one.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you mind lending me a hundred bucks?

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sure thing.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Example two.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day?

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Sure thing.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Example three.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you mind lending me a hundred bucks?

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sure thing.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day?

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Sure thing.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Example four.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Can you get some milk on the way home?

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sure thing.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm on my way now.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, so sure thing.

172
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Basically, yeah, no problem.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Or, okay.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or, I'll do it.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll do it.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's fine.

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So, it's a very common way you will hear this a lot when somebody agrees or says, yes, no problem.

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, and again, it will help you sound really native-like to use this phrase.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Well, the next one.

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The taxi driver says, I was born and raised here.

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I was born and raised here.

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Born and raised.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, so this is a way of saying I was born in this country and I haven't left this country.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So, I'm from this country.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Born and raised here in the good old US of A.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Good old US of A.

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The good old US of A.

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So, this is a pretty interesting way of saying America.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's actually more of a phrase, right?

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The good old US of A.

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yep.

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, it means the good United States of America.

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, it's kind of a fond way or friendly way of describing America.

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright.

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And we have one more word for language takeaway.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, the taxi driver was talking about his Columbian heritage.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Columbian heritage.

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Heritage.

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Alright.

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So, if I have Columbian heritage, what does that mean?

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Your grandmother or grandfather, great-grandmother or someone in your family is from Columbia.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Okay.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And what about the word heritage by itself?

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah.

209
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So, your heritage is basically your culture, your...

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, your customs, your history.

211
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay.

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So, heritage.

213
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A country rich in heritage.

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Lots of good old historical culture in that country.

215
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

216
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Very good.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So, now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the last time.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Now we can understand all these phrases and these great words that we've just looked at.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Where to, miss?

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hi.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sure thing.

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So, where are you flying in from?

225
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
From China.

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Really?

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You don't look very Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so.

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's fine.

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I am actually from Mexico.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

231
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wow.

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Sounds interesting.

233
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't get me wrong.

236
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, thank you.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In that case, I am 26 years old.

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And what about you yourself?

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good ol' U.S.

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
of A.

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Although I have some Colombian heritage.

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Really?

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's great.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you speak Spanish?

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Uh, yeah, of course.

247
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
¿Qué bien?

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Entonces puedemos hablar en español.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So Marco, this taxi driver makes a bit of a mistake when he asks the woman how old she is.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes.

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There are a couple of questions that in some cultures are considered to be normal and okay, but in other cultures they're not really well accepted.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay, so in Anglo culture, for example, it's really impolite to ask a woman how old she is.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Right.

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Women are a little bit more sensitive about their age.

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Others aren't so much, but it's usually better to just not ask.

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And what else should we avoid talking about in small talk?

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, for example, when you ask a person their occupation, you can ask what they do for a living, but don't ask how much money they make.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's right.

260
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Anglo people are really sensitive about talking about money.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
We hate talking about money.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right.

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So don't ask somebody their salary or how much money they make.

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's just not considered to be polite.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And another good one to be careful of is asking if someone is married or not.

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right.

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sometimes you're just being friendly and you want to know if that person has family or something, but you have to be careful when and where you ask this question.

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Right.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So if they've mentioned their family, if they talked about their kids or something else to do with their family, then it's okay.

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Right.

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You can say, well, how long have you been married?

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But if a guy asks a girl, oh, are you married?

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It kind of sounds like maybe he's interested in her or that he's trying to come on to her and to be maybe more than friendly, right?

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's right.

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
