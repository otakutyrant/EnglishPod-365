00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,879
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:07,820
Welcome back to another lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:08,539
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,439
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,599
And today we are going to have a very casual, normal conversation.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:15,660
That's right.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,160
We're going to listen in on some small talk between a taxi driver and the passenger.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,140
Small talk.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,780
So that's basically...

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,640
Small, short conversations you have with someone that you don't know very well.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,539
Okay, so typical questions like how old are you, where you're from, etc.

12
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:33,259
That's right.

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:39,659
And this can be really hard for English learners because they often don't know what the right thing to say or the right thing to talk about.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,119
So we're going to give you a lot of phrases in this lesson that you can use in small talk.

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:51,399
Okay, so we don't have anything to preview today, so let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back.

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,840
Where to, miss?

17
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,000
Hi, Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,340
Sure thing.

19
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,079
So where are you flying in from?

20
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,159
From China.

21
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:11,459
Really?

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,359
You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,319
It's fine.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,859
I am actually from Mexico.

25
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:23,099
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
Wow, sounds interesting.

27
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,959
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,120
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,540
Don't get me wrong.

30
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,920
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

31
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,480
Well, thank you.

32
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,879
In that case, I am 26 years old.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,319
And what about you yourself?

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S.

35
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,799
of A.

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,540
Although I have some Colombian heritage.

37
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,340
Really?

38
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,439
That's great.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Do you speak Spanish?

40
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,760
Uh, yeah, of course.

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:55,739
¿Qué bien?

42
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,319
Entonces podemos hablar en español.

43
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:08,400
All right, so I don't think this guy spoke much Spanish, do you?

44
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,080
No, even though he has Colombian heritage, I think he doesn't speak much.

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,060
But maybe he's just a little bit rusty.

46
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,800
Maybe.

47
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,319
But what he does speak is English.

48
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,319
And since this is EnglishPod, why don't we take a look at some of the phrases that they used for Smalltalk and Fluency Builder.

49
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:32,460
All right, so today on Fluency Builder, we're going to take a look at phrases that both the passenger and the taxi driver used to make Smalltalk.

50
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,800
So why don't we start with the first one?

51
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,060
All right, so the taxi driver tells the passenger that she doesn't look very Chinese.

52
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,599
If you don't mind me saying so.

53
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,620
Right, so he said, you don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

54
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,520
If you don't mind me saying so.

55
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,719
So what does he mean by this last part of his sentence?

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,939
Well, this is a phrase that we use to soften a sort of statement that might be a little bit rude.

57
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,520
She could be Chinese.

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,219
Right?

59
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,240
So it may be a little bit rude to say that, but he kind of apologizes.

60
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:07,939
That's right.

61
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,259
By saying, if you don't mind me saying so.

62
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:15,080
Okay, so for example, I could say, hey Marco, you look a little tired today if you don't mind me saying so.

63
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,060
Okay, so does it always go at the end?

64
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,319
You could use it at the beginning.

65
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,520
If you don't mind me saying so, I just don't think this is a good idea.

66
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:22,719
Okay, very good.

67
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,479
So you can use this phrase in the beginning or at the end of a sentence.

68
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,039
Right, and it makes your statement a little bit less rude.

69
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,319
If you don't mind me saying so.

70
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:40,480
Now again, he also apologizes a little bit when he says, Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy, but...

71
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,480
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but...

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but...

73
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,680
Okay, so let's take a look at this.

74
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,139
Nosy, what's this?

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,780
Okay, when somebody is nosy, it means they are very curious.

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,639
They are asking too many questions.

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,159
Yeah, asking more questions than they should ask.

78
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:58,719
Right.

79
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,060
So he apologizes and says, well, excuse me if I'm asking too many questions.

80
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,300
And then he asks her another question.

81
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,400
He asks her how old she is.

82
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,340
So again, it's a polite way of maybe asking a question that might be a little bit sensitive.

83
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,979
Yeah, or a little bit impolite.

84
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so of course, asking a woman her age maybe is a little bit impolite, right?

85
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,480
Yes, typically women don't like that too much.

86
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,319
But our next phrase, we heard the taxi driver say, Don't get me wrong.

87
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,019
Don't get me wrong.

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,959
Don't get me wrong.

89
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,540
Okay, so don't get me wrong.

90
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,319
He says, well, don't misunderstand what I'm saying.

91
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,879
That's right.

92
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,660
This phrase is used so commonly in English that I think it would help us to hear some examples.

93
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,519
Don't get me wrong.

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,699
It's not that I think you stole my computer.

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,259
It's just that you were the only one who could get into my room.

96
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,579
Example two.

97
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,740
I do have a few problems with the plan, but don't get me wrong.

98
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,120
I still think it's a good idea.

99
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,420
Example three.

100
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:05,839
Don't get me wrong.

101
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,199
I think John's a nice guy.

102
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,839
He's just a bit disorganized.

103
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,540
All right, very good example.

104
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,240
So don't get me wrong, right?

105
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,920
That's right.

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,100
And now for the final phrase on putting it together today.

107
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,660
Well, the passenger, the woman says her age.

108
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,819
She says, I'm 26 years old and what about yourself?

109
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,300
What about yourself?

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,399
What about yourself?

111
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,459
All right, now this sentence isn't very correct actually, right?

112
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:40,819
Yeah, technically it's not correct in grammar, but it is used so commonly every day by American English speakers that we thought we'd show it to you.

113
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,899
Okay, so you would say, I am 26 years old and what about you?

114
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,439
That's right.

115
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,199
Okay, but commonly you will hear people say, what about yourself?

116
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,560
And if you use this, you'll sound really fluent and really native-like.

117
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,759
Okay, very good.

118
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,399
So what about yourself?

119
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,540
So again, it's just like, what about you?

120
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,339
So I could say, hey Marco, I'm going away on holiday this weekend and what about yourself?

121
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,839
Okay, what about yourself?

122
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,060
So we've taken a look at these four phrases on putting it together.

123
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,100
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time?

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,399
We're going to slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and take a look at some vocabulary words on language takeaway.

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:28,459
Music Where to miss?

126
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:35,279
Hi, Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

127
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,860
Sure thing.

128
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,259
So, where are you flying in from?

129
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,800
From China.

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,199
Really?

131
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:49,639
You don't look very Chinese to me, if you don't mind me saying so.

132
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,660
It's fine.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,240
I am actually from Mexico.

134
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,620
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,120
Wow, sounds interesting.

136
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:12,180
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

137
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,819
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

138
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't get me wrong.

139
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:25,620
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

140
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,040
Well, thank you.

141
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:33,600
In that case, I am 26 years old and what about yourself?

142
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,379
I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old US of A.

143
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,660
Although, I have some Colombian heritage.

144
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,839
Really?

145
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,439
That's great.

146
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,959
Do you speak some Spanish?

147
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,540
Uh, yeah.

148
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,920
Of course.

149
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,680
Que bien.

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,740
Entonces podemos hablar en español.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,560
Well, we've got some interesting vocabulary words and phrases here in language takeaway.

152
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,480
And the first one...

153
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,600
Well, after she gets in the taxi and tells him where she wants to go, he answers by saying, Sure thing.

154
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,180
So, if I say, yeah, sure thing, what does that mean?

155
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,759
Well, let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

156
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:26,300
Example one.

157
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:28,980
Do you mind lending me a hundred bucks?

158
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,160
Sure thing.

159
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
Example two.

160
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,279
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day?

161
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,460
Sure thing.

162
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:39,980
Example three.

163
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,940
Do you mind lending me a hundred bucks?

164
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,679
Sure thing.

165
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,899
Could you please send me the email by the end of the day?

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,659
Sure thing.

167
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,039
Example four.

168
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,740
Can you get some milk on the way home?

169
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:52,440
Sure thing.

170
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm on my way now.

171
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,340
Okay, so sure thing.

172
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,879
Basically, yeah, no problem.

173
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:57,779
Or, okay.

174
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,960
Or, I'll do it.

175
00:08:59,100 --> 00:08:59,639
I'll do it.

176
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,399
It's fine.

177
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:06,980
So, it's a very common way you will hear this a lot when somebody agrees or says, yes, no problem.

178
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,720
Yeah, and again, it will help you sound really native-like to use this phrase.

179
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,659
Well, the next one.

180
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,659
The taxi driver says, I was born and raised here.

181
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,379
I was born and raised here.

182
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,740
Born and raised.

183
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,860
Okay, so this is a way of saying I was born in this country and I haven't left this country.

184
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,320
That's right.

185
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,759
So, I'm from this country.

186
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Okay.

187
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,700
Born and raised here in the good old US of A.

188
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,980
Good old US of A.

189
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,240
The good old US of A.

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,360
So, this is a pretty interesting way of saying America.

191
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,080
Right.

192
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,340
It's actually more of a phrase, right?

193
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,639
The good old US of A.

194
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:45,919
Yep.

195
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,659
Okay.

196
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,200
So, it means the good United States of America.

197
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah, it's kind of a fond way or friendly way of describing America.

198
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright.

199
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,899
And we have one more word for language takeaway.

200
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,200
Well, the taxi driver was talking about his Columbian heritage.

201
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,860
Columbian heritage.

202
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,600
Heritage.

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,460
Alright.

204
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,340
So, if I have Columbian heritage, what does that mean?

205
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:15,039
Your grandmother or grandfather, great-grandmother or someone in your family is from Columbia.

206
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:15,620
Okay.

207
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,080
And what about the word heritage by itself?

208
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:18,659
Yeah.

209
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:22,600
So, your heritage is basically your culture, your...

210
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah, your customs, your history.

211
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,440
Okay.

212
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,919
So, heritage.

213
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:30,279
A country rich in heritage.

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
Lots of good old historical culture in that country.

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,799
Okay.

216
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,240
Very good.

217
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,159
So, now it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the last time.

218
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,639
Now we can understand all these phrases and these great words that we've just looked at.

219
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,019
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

220
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:51,360
Where to, miss?

221
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,259
Hi.

222
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,480
Crenshaw and Hawthorne at the Holiday Inn that is on that corner.

223
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:57,860
Sure thing.

224
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,600
So, where are you flying in from?

225
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,740
From China.

226
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:04,019
Really?

227
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,919
You don't look very Chinese to me if you don't mind me saying so.

228
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:08,840
It's fine.

229
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,379
I am actually from Mexico.

230
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,620
I was in China on a business trip visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.

231
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:16,299
Wow.

232
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,019
Sounds interesting.

233
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,460
Excuse me if I'm being a bit nosy, but how old are you?

234
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,679
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?

235
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,080
Don't get me wrong.

236
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,480
It's just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas.

237
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, thank you.

238
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,419
In that case, I am 26 years old.

239
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,860
And what about you yourself?

240
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,059
I'm 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good ol' U.S.

241
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:39,320
of A.

242
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,059
Although I have some Colombian heritage.

243
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,120
Really?

244
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,980
That's great.

245
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,100
Do you speak Spanish?

246
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,240
Uh, yeah, of course.

247
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,279
¿Qué bien?

248
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,879
Entonces puedemos hablar en español.

249
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:03,059
So Marco, this taxi driver makes a bit of a mistake when he asks the woman how old she is.

250
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,500
Yes.

251
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:04,899
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:13,259
There are a couple of questions that in some cultures are considered to be normal and okay, but in other cultures they're not really well accepted.

253
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:19,460
Okay, so in Anglo culture, for example, it's really impolite to ask a woman how old she is.

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:19,840
Right.

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,159
Women are a little bit more sensitive about their age.

256
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,700
Others aren't so much, but it's usually better to just not ask.

257
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,919
And what else should we avoid talking about in small talk?

258
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,399
Well, for example, when you ask a person their occupation, you can ask what they do for a living, but don't ask how much money they make.

259
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:36,820
That's right.

260
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,840
Anglo people are really sensitive about talking about money.

261
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,440
We hate talking about money.

262
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,299
Right.

263
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,620
So don't ask somebody their salary or how much money they make.

264
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,779
It's just not considered to be polite.

265
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,779
And another good one to be careful of is asking if someone is married or not.

266
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:53,519
Right.

267
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:02,519
Sometimes you're just being friendly and you want to know if that person has family or something, but you have to be careful when and where you ask this question.

268
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:02,759
Right.

269
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,139
So if they've mentioned their family, if they talked about their kids or something else to do with their family, then it's okay.

270
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:09,480
Right.

271
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,539
You can say, well, how long have you been married?

272
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:14,940
But if a guy asks a girl, oh, are you married?

273
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:23,100
It kind of sounds like maybe he's interested in her or that he's trying to come on to her and to be maybe more than friendly, right?

274
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,600
That's right.

275
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,200
Okay.

276
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:28,879
