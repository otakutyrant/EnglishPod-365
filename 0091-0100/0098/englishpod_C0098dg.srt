EnglishPod.com Valerie, hi.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,380
Wow, how have you been?

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,960
It's been such a long time.

4
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,240
Darlene, indeed it's been a while.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,439
How have you been?

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,140
Wow, you look amazing.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,140
I love what you've done with your hair.

8
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:20,000
Really?

9
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,320
Thanks.

10
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,920
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,800
Look at you.

12
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,140
God, you haven't ate just a day.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,600
Hey, what is your secret?

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,460
Come on.

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,060
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

16
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,039
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

17
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,119
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,280
They grow up so fast, you know.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,039
He is such a handsome guy.

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,340
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,479
Thank you.

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,259
What about your daughter, Pamela?

23
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,320
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

24
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,759
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,000
Such a lovely girl.

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,159
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

27
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,079
But of course.

28
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,079
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,219
Same here.

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,760
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

31
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,040
That would be great.

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,959
Give me a call.

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,159
See you soon.

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:17,879
Bye.

35
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,140
Ugh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

36
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,920
Thank you.
