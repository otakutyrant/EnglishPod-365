EnglishPod.com Valerie, hi.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Wow, how have you been?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's been such a long time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Darlene, indeed it's been a while.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How have you been?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Wow, you look amazing.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I love what you've done with your hair.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Really?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thanks.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Look at you.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
God, you haven't ate just a day.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey, what is your secret?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come on.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They grow up so fast, you know.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He is such a handsome guy.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What about your daughter, Pamela?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Such a lovely girl.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But of course.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Same here.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That would be great.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Give me a call.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
See you soon.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Bye.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ugh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you.
