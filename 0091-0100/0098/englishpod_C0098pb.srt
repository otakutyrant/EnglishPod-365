00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,779
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:06,980
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:14,660
And today we are going to be teaching you a very important technique, especially for the guys if you want to have good luck with the ladies, right?

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,359
Oh, Marco.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,480
Well, today's lesson is called That's Flattering.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,620
Right, so we are going to be teaching you how to flatter someone.

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,620
Okay, so what does it mean to flatter someone?

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,380
Well, basically you're going to be giving compliments and you're going to make that person feel good about themselves.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:32,820
That's right.

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,920
Okay, so flattering.

13
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:42,159
Now before we get on with this flattering lesson, we need to look at some vocabulary in vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,719
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,159
All right, on vocabulary preview today, we have two small words.

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,899
So the first one is bar exam, the bar exam, the bar exam.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,799
So the bar exam is that formal test that lawyers must do to become official lawyers.

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:07,000
Right, so it's that final exam in order to finally become a lawyer.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,359
Okay, and what about our next word?

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,140
Well, we're also going to hear in the dialogue obnoxious.

21
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,000
Obnoxious.

22
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,040
Obnoxious.

23
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:18,079
Okay, so this is an adjective.

24
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,780
Yes, and it means something that is really, really annoying.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,599
Okay, so something can be, so something can be obnoxious.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,540
Or someone.

27
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:28,219
Or someone.

28
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:29,400
Okay, very good.

29
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:38,579
So now we have these two words that we're going to listen to in the dialogue, and now let's listen to two people as they flatter each other in our dialogue.

30
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,819
Valerie, hi.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,079
Wow, how have you been?

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,459
It's been such a long time.

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,959
Darlene, indeed it's been a while.

34
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,099
How have you been?

35
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,840
Wow, you look amazing.

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,859
I love what you've done with your hair.

37
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:01,700
Really?

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,060
Thanks.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,620
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

40
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,500
Look at you.

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
God, you haven't aged a day.

42
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,300
What is your secret?

43
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,159
Come on.

44
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,699
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

45
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,560
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

46
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,860
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

47
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,979
They grow up so fast, you know.

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,740
He is such a handsome guy.

49
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,039
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,180
Thank you.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,960
What about your daughter, Pamela?

52
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,020
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

53
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,460
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

54
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,719
Such a lovely girl.

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,939
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,800
But of course.

57
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:51,800
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,919
Same here.

59
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,460
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

60
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,740
That would be great.

61
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:57,659
Give me a call.

62
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,860
See you soon.

63
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,560
Bye.

64
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,860
Oh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:21,900
All right, so this is your typical normal everyday behavior that women show to each other, right?

66
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,180
Yeah, I think it's very common.

67
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:31,719
It's very hard to argue against this because I think everyone does it, or at least you've heard maybe your mother or somebody talk to her friends like this, right?

68
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,960
So pretend you like a person who you actually hate.

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,900
Right, you have to be courteous.

70
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,180
Is that what you're doing to me now?

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,680
All right, no I'm not, but we can take a look at some of this great language, very rich language that we found in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

72
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:47,979
Fluency Builder.

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:59,919
All right, we're doing things a little bit different in this lesson, so we're going to do two Fluency Builders, and in the first one we're going to focus on language you can use to flatter someone.

74
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,719
Right, so let's get started.

75
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,819
In the very first part of the dialogue we heard Valerie say, I love what you've done with your hair.

76
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,979
I love what you've done with your hair.

77
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,460
I love what you've done with.

78
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,019
I love what you've done with.

79
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,540
Okay, so if somebody says this, basically they're saying, I like the change you made.

80
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,199
Okay, and change not only to your hair, right?

81
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,279
It could be anything, so I love what you've done with your new house.

82
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,879
Okay, or I can say, I love what you've done with your garden, it looks so beautiful.

83
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,600
So something that you've changed, you can use this phrase for.

84
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:41,379
Okay, and in this case it's her hair, so she is complimenting her on her hair.

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,699
We also heard Darlene say, you haven't aged a day.

86
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,259
You haven't aged a day.

87
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,600
You haven't aged a day.

88
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,860
Okay, so now she is saying that she hasn't gotten any older.

89
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,220
That's right, to age is to get older.

90
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,980
Okay, so this is a very common way of telling somebody you look great.

91
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,560
That's right, you look young.

92
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:02,879
You look young, you look great.

93
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,300
You haven't aged a day.

94
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,199
Alright, so then they talk about their kids, and they're talking about the sun, and Valerie says, he's such a handsome guy.

95
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,620
He is such a handsome guy.

96
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,139
He is such a handsome guy.

97
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:24,560
Okay, so this structure is important because now I can change the adjective, and I am saying he is very intelligent.

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,860
He is such an intelligent guy.

99
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,139
That's right, or even this is such a good day.

100
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,439
Alright, very good.

101
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,860
So now why don't we combine the two phrases that we've just heard.

102
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,519
I love what you've done with, and he is such a, and let's listen to some examples.

103
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:44,420
Example one.

104
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,560
We love what you've done with this place.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,519
Such a beautiful room.

106
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,879
Example two.

107
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,959
I love what you've done with your hair.

108
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,879
Such a nice color on you.

109
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,199
Example three.

110
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,839
I love what you've done with this space.

111
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,560
Such a wonderful garden.

112
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,040
Okay, I really like how those two phrases can fit together.

113
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,939
Yeah, they are very good, and now you can use them together or separately like in the dialogue.

114
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,420
That's right.

115
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,660
Now let's move to our final flattering phrase.

116
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,040
Valerie says that Darlene's son gets his looks from his mother.

117
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,040
Right, she says he gets his looks from his mother, of course.

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,040
He gets his looks from.

119
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,480
Okay, so when she says he gets his looks from, she is saying his appearance.

120
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,540
His positive appearance, his good appearance.

121
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,740
Right, his good looks.

122
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,519
Okay, so now we can change the noun, and I can say he gets his intelligence from his father.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Right, or even he gets his beautiful singing voice from his mother.

124
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, so now typically you would say his mother, his father, or maybe one of the grandparents, right?

125
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,579
Maybe, yeah.

126
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,100
But you wouldn't say he gets his good looks from his brother.

127
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,740
No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:12,259
Mother, father, grandma, grandpa.

129
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:23,079
Alright, so now that we've covered four great ways of flattering someone, let's listen to this dialogue again, but we're gonna slow it down a little bit so you can pick up on these phrases.

130
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,399
Valerie, hi.

131
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,680
Wow, how have you been?

132
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,279
It's been such a long time.

133
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,680
Darlene, indeed.

134
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,560
It's been a while.

135
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,720
How have you been?

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,459
Wow, you look amazing.

137
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,459
I love what you've done with your hair.

138
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:44,300
Really?

139
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,639
Thanks.

140
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,220
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

141
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,100
Look at you.

142
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,480
God, you haven't aged a day.

143
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,939
What is your secret?

144
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:54,779
Come on.

145
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Well, I've been watching what I eat and I work out three times a week.

146
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,379
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

147
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,519
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

148
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,620
They grew up so fast, you know.

149
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,399
He is such a handsome guy.

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,699
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

151
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:13,819
Thank you.

152
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,600
What about your daughter, Pamela?

153
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,699
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

154
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,100
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

155
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,339
Such a lovely girl.

156
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,519
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

157
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,420
But of course.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,419
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

159
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,559
Same here.

160
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,100
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

161
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,399
That would be great.

162
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,320
Give me a call.

163
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,500
See you soon.

164
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,220
Bye.

165
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,600
Oh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

166
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:12,379
Okay, so we we see a lot of great flattering language in this dialogue, but we also have some really good language and phrases you can use in small talk in any situation.

167
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:19,820
Right, so maybe if you talk to a friend that you haven't seen in a while, we have some really great phrases for, as you say, small talk.

168
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:23,639
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder, part two.

169
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:26,960
Fluency Builder.

170
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,440
Okay, so let's start with the first phrase.

171
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,620
She says, Valerie, hi, wow, how are you?

172
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:36,240
It's been such a long time.

173
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,200
It's been such a long time.

174
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,419
It's been such a long time.

175
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,360
So basically here she's saying we haven't seen each other in a long time.

176
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,159
Right, but it kind of gives you that idea that she regrets not talking to her for such a long time.

177
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,740
Yes, she wishes she could have talked to her.

178
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,659
It's been such a long time.

179
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:55,279
How are you?

180
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,480
So a wonderful way to start a conversation.

181
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,440
So when she says, by the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

182
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,220
Right, by the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

183
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:15,879
So this phrase, by the way, I heard blah, blah, blah, is really, really useful.

184
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,639
Right, let's take a look at the first part, by the way.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,840
So this is a way to connect two different ideas or to start a new topic.

186
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,299
Exactly, and now when she says, I heard your son recently graduated.

187
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:36,539
So we use this phrase, I heard, when we've got information that we're not sure about.

188
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:44,700
Right, or also you are demonstrating interest about a certain topic or a news event that you would like to know about.

189
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,440
Right, and so basically you're asking the other person, tell me about this.

190
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,840
Right, so I can say, hey, by the way, I heard you got married.

191
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,779
So then I'd tell you all about my wedding.

192
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,419
Exactly.

193
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,500
Okay, so this is a very common way of talking to someone or getting some more information from a person.

194
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,240
So let's listen to some more examples of, by the way.

195
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,179
Example one.

196
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:11,259
By the way, I heard you've recently been promoted.

197
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,759
Example two.

198
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,519
I heard your daughter just had a baby.

199
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:22,100
Congratulations.

200
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,100
Example three.

201
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,679
Oh, I heard you just got back from holiday in France.

202
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,860
Alright, now since these two ladies don't like each other very much, they want to end the conversation, right?

203
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:43,360
Right, they want to end the conversation and, well, you want to end it in a polite way, right?

204
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,740
So they use a really great phrase here.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,700
They said, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

206
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,539
Right, so it's like, well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

207
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:57,539
So it's been great talking to you.

208
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,720
I've enjoyed talking to you.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,460
Right, so this is a very polite, very subtle way of saying, hey, I have to go or bye, I can't talk anymore.

210
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah, when you say that, you know that the conversation is ending.

211
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:10,299
Exactly.

212
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,779
Now she says, I have to get going.

213
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,080
What does it mean, get going?

214
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,720
That doesn't make much sense.

215
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:17,559
Basically, it just means leave.

216
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,320
Okay, I have to leave, I have to get going.

217
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,899
You should get going, you're going to be late.

218
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,480
Exactly.

219
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,159
Okay.

220
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,740
Some really good small talk phrases that are useful in any situation.

221
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,580
So why don't we hear them again one more time by listening to the dialogue?

222
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,059
Valerie, hi, wow, how have you been?

223
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,940
It's been a while.

224
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,120
How have you been?

225
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,820
Wow, you look amazing.

226
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,820
I love what you've done with your hair.

227
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:52,679
Really?

228
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,000
Thanks.

229
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,620
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

230
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,840
Look at you, God, you haven't ate just a day.

231
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,279
What is your secret?

232
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,139
Come on.

233
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,720
Well, I've been watching what I eat and I work out three times a week.

234
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,700
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

235
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,799
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

236
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,960
They grow up so fast, you know.

237
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,720
He is such a handsome guy.

238
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,019
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

239
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,159
Thank you.

240
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,919
What about your daughter, Pamela?

241
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,019
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

242
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,440
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico and we all attended.

243
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,679
Such a lovely girl.

244
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,879
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

245
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:39,779
But of course.

246
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,779
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:43,899
Same here.

248
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,220
We'll catch up soon.

249
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
Maybe over coffee.

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,740
That would be great.

251
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,659
Give me a call.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,840
See you soon.

253
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:50,519
Bye.

254
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:56,879
Oh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

255
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,559
All right.

256
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,059
Very good.

257
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,460
So now you have a couple of phrases that you can use to flatter someone, be it your friend or somebody that you know or anyone.

258
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,919
And well, they are very, very useful.

259
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,700
And if you use them correctly, of course.

260
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,039
Right.

261
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,860
And these phrases sound really honest and really natural.

262
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,980
Very native like.

263
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,659
Okay.
