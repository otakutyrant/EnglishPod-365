00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we are going to be teaching you a very important technique, especially for the guys if you want to have good luck with the ladies, right?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, Marco.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, today's lesson is called That's Flattering.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right, so we are going to be teaching you how to flatter someone.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, so what does it mean to flatter someone?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, basically you're going to be giving compliments and you're going to make that person feel good about themselves.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, so flattering.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Now before we get on with this flattering lesson, we need to look at some vocabulary in vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All right, on vocabulary preview today, we have two small words.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So the first one is bar exam, the bar exam, the bar exam.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So the bar exam is that formal test that lawyers must do to become official lawyers.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right, so it's that final exam in order to finally become a lawyer.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, and what about our next word?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, we're also going to hear in the dialogue obnoxious.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Obnoxious.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Obnoxious.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, so this is an adjective.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, and it means something that is really, really annoying.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, so something can be, so something can be obnoxious.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or someone.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Or someone.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, very good.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So now we have these two words that we're going to listen to in the dialogue, and now let's listen to two people as they flatter each other in our dialogue.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Valerie, hi.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wow, how have you been?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's been such a long time.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Darlene, indeed it's been a while.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How have you been?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wow, you look amazing.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I love what you've done with your hair.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Really?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thanks.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Look at you.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
God, you haven't aged a day.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What is your secret?

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Come on.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, I've been watching what I eat, and I work out three times a week.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They grow up so fast, you know.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He is such a handsome guy.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What about your daughter, Pamela?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Such a lovely girl.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But of course.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Same here.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That would be great.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Give me a call.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
See you soon.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Bye.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All right, so this is your typical normal everyday behavior that women show to each other, right?

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, I think it's very common.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's very hard to argue against this because I think everyone does it, or at least you've heard maybe your mother or somebody talk to her friends like this, right?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So pretend you like a person who you actually hate.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right, you have to be courteous.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is that what you're doing to me now?

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All right, no I'm not, but we can take a look at some of this great language, very rich language that we found in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Fluency Builder.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All right, we're doing things a little bit different in this lesson, so we're going to do two Fluency Builders, and in the first one we're going to focus on language you can use to flatter someone.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right, so let's get started.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
In the very first part of the dialogue we heard Valerie say, I love what you've done with your hair.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I love what you've done with your hair.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I love what you've done with.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I love what you've done with.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, so if somebody says this, basically they're saying, I like the change you made.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, and change not only to your hair, right?

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It could be anything, so I love what you've done with your new house.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, or I can say, I love what you've done with your garden, it looks so beautiful.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So something that you've changed, you can use this phrase for.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, and in this case it's her hair, so she is complimenting her on her hair.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We also heard Darlene say, you haven't aged a day.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You haven't aged a day.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You haven't aged a day.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay, so now she is saying that she hasn't gotten any older.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right, to age is to get older.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, so this is a very common way of telling somebody you look great.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right, you look young.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You look young, you look great.

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You haven't aged a day.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright, so then they talk about their kids, and they're talking about the sun, and Valerie says, he's such a handsome guy.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He is such a handsome guy.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is such a handsome guy.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, so this structure is important because now I can change the adjective, and I am saying he is very intelligent.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He is such an intelligent guy.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right, or even this is such a good day.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Alright, very good.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So now why don't we combine the two phrases that we've just heard.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I love what you've done with, and he is such a, and let's listen to some examples.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Example one.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We love what you've done with this place.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Such a beautiful room.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Example two.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I love what you've done with your hair.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Such a nice color on you.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Example three.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I love what you've done with this space.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Such a wonderful garden.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, I really like how those two phrases can fit together.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, they are very good, and now you can use them together or separately like in the dialogue.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now let's move to our final flattering phrase.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Valerie says that Darlene's son gets his looks from his mother.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right, she says he gets his looks from his mother, of course.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He gets his looks from.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay, so when she says he gets his looks from, she is saying his appearance.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
His positive appearance, his good appearance.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Right, his good looks.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, so now we can change the noun, and I can say he gets his intelligence from his father.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Right, or even he gets his beautiful singing voice from his mother.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, so now typically you would say his mother, his father, or maybe one of the grandparents, right?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Maybe, yeah.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But you wouldn't say he gets his good looks from his brother.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, no, no, no, no.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Mother, father, grandma, grandpa.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Alright, so now that we've covered four great ways of flattering someone, let's listen to this dialogue again, but we're gonna slow it down a little bit so you can pick up on these phrases.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Valerie, hi.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Wow, how have you been?

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's been such a long time.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Darlene, indeed.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's been a while.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How have you been?

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wow, you look amazing.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I love what you've done with your hair.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Really?

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Thanks.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Look at you.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
God, you haven't aged a day.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What is your secret?

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Come on.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, I've been watching what I eat and I work out three times a week.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They grew up so fast, you know.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He is such a handsome guy.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Thank you.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What about your daughter, Pamela?

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico, and we all attended.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Such a lovely girl.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But of course.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Same here.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We'll catch up soon, maybe over coffee.

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That would be great.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Give me a call.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
See you soon.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bye.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so we we see a lot of great flattering language in this dialogue, but we also have some really good language and phrases you can use in small talk in any situation.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right, so maybe if you talk to a friend that you haven't seen in a while, we have some really great phrases for, as you say, small talk.

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder, part two.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Fluency Builder.

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay, so let's start with the first phrase.

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
She says, Valerie, hi, wow, how are you?

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's been such a long time.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's been such a long time.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's been such a long time.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So basically here she's saying we haven't seen each other in a long time.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right, but it kind of gives you that idea that she regrets not talking to her for such a long time.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes, she wishes she could have talked to her.

178
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's been such a long time.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How are you?

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So a wonderful way to start a conversation.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So when she says, by the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right, by the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So this phrase, by the way, I heard blah, blah, blah, is really, really useful.

184
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right, let's take a look at the first part, by the way.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So this is a way to connect two different ideas or to start a new topic.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Exactly, and now when she says, I heard your son recently graduated.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So we use this phrase, I heard, when we've got information that we're not sure about.

188
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Right, or also you are demonstrating interest about a certain topic or a news event that you would like to know about.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Right, and so basically you're asking the other person, tell me about this.

190
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right, so I can say, hey, by the way, I heard you got married.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So then I'd tell you all about my wedding.

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Exactly.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, so this is a very common way of talking to someone or getting some more information from a person.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So let's listen to some more examples of, by the way.

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Example one.

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
By the way, I heard you've recently been promoted.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Example two.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I heard your daughter just had a baby.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Congratulations.

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Example three.

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, I heard you just got back from holiday in France.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Alright, now since these two ladies don't like each other very much, they want to end the conversation, right?

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Right, they want to end the conversation and, well, you want to end it in a polite way, right?

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So they use a really great phrase here.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They said, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Right, so it's like, well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

207
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So it's been great talking to you.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I've enjoyed talking to you.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Right, so this is a very polite, very subtle way of saying, hey, I have to go or bye, I can't talk anymore.

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, when you say that, you know that the conversation is ending.

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Exactly.

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now she says, I have to get going.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What does it mean, get going?

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That doesn't make much sense.

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Basically, it just means leave.

216
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay, I have to leave, I have to get going.

217
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You should get going, you're going to be late.

218
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Exactly.

219
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay.

220
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Some really good small talk phrases that are useful in any situation.

221
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So why don't we hear them again one more time by listening to the dialogue?

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Valerie, hi, wow, how have you been?

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's been a while.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How have you been?

225
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Wow, you look amazing.

226
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I love what you've done with your hair.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Really?

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Thanks.

229
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I went to that hair salon you told me about, but enough about me.

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Look at you, God, you haven't ate just a day.

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What is your secret?

232
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Come on.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, I've been watching what I eat and I work out three times a week.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
By the way, I heard your son recently graduated.

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, my little Paul is finally a doctor.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They grow up so fast, you know.

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He is such a handsome guy.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He gets his looks from his mother, of course.

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you.

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What about your daughter, Pamela?

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I heard she passed the bar exam and married recently.

242
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh yes, she had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel, Mexico and we all attended.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Such a lovely girl.

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But of course.

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, it's been great talking to you, but I have to get going.

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Same here.

248
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We'll catch up soon.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Maybe over coffee.

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That would be great.

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Give me a call.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
See you soon.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Bye.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, I cannot stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
All right.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Very good.

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So now you have a couple of phrases that you can use to flatter someone, be it your friend or somebody that you know or anyone.

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And well, they are very, very useful.

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And if you use them correctly, of course.

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Right.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And these phrases sound really honest and really natural.

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Very native like.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Okay.
