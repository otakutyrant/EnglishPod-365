00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we've got a lesson for you that's about an unusual topic, something we've never talked about here on EnglishPod.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:24,000
As you know, in EnglishPod, we like to talk about all sorts of topics, especially topics that are real-life topics, so probably a lot of things that you won't find in your normal English notebooks or English learning books.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So we want to tell you in advance, today's lesson is about drugs.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So if you're a younger user or you have kids, maybe they shouldn't listen to today's lesson, but you're going to learn a lot of the names for drugs and also how to turn down an offer of drugs.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So let's check out today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the things that you've heard.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey, man.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You want to buy some weed?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some what?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Weed.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, uh, no thanks.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, I'm okay, really.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Come on, man.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I even got dope and acid.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Try some.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do you really have all of these drugs?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where do you get them from?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I got my connections.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just tell me what you want, and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hmm, sounds good.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's see.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I want...

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah?

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You are under arrest.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Dope!

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright, we're back.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So as Catherine mentioned, obviously everywhere in the world maybe most likely you've been offered drugs, so we're not only going to talk about drugs, but we're also going to give you some vocab in English how to reject or turn down the offer of drugs.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And now what we're going to take a look at, let's start in language takeaway with some of the names of these drugs in English.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Language takeaway.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, so we're in language takeaway here, and I want to warn you, some of these words are slang.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That means they're not words from like a dictionary.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
These are words people use when they're talking to each other in daily life, or words that you hear on the street.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You may even hear them a lot in movies as well.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, movies and TV.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So this first one, weed, is something...

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's even a TV show called Weeds.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right, that talks about this topic.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So weed is the street name or the most common name for the drug marijuana.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Marijuana is the drug name, but there are many, many, many other names in English that you'll hear.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So weed is one of them.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A weed is a kind of thing that grows, like grass or a flower, that you cut because you don't want it.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's bad.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It smells bad.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's exactly right.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So the colloquial name for marijuana is weed, and obviously the person that's being offered these drugs doesn't understand what that means.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So he goes on and he gives a couple of different other street names for the same drug.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So the first one, so the next one is pot.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So he says pot or ganja or Mary Jane or even chronic.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So all of these are synonyms.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They mean exactly the same thing.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They all mean marijuana.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But then after that, the drug dealer offers other kinds of drugs.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He says blow.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So now we may know the verb to blow, right?

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To blow air.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But in this case, it's a noun.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So he says, I have blow.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So he's offering this drug called blow.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And what is blow?

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Blow is the street name for cocaine.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So there's a very famous movie called Blow, and it was about selling cocaine.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So after he talks about having blow, he also says if you want to do a few lines.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And so this is what you'll commonly hear people saying how they do this drug.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So for example, you may know that many drugs, they're consumed in different ways.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
For example, weed.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
People smoke it, right?

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In this case, when we're talking about cocaine or blow, then that's why he refers to do a few lines.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All right.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Because people breathe it in through their nose.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So that's the colloquial way of saying of how you say that, how you consume this drug.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So moving along, there's two more drugs that got mentioned in today's dialogue.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They're dope and acid.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now dope can mean two different things.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sometimes it means marijuana, like some of those other words we heard earlier, but sometimes it also means a very, very serious drug called crack cocaine.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And that's something that people breathe in and it's very, very addictive.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, that's right.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And also the other word that we have there or the other drug, acid, you may know the word acid is a very harmful substance.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Like for example, batteries, they have a certain type of acid that, for example, will melt metal or if it gets on your skin, it will burn you.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's right.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But acid, when it's a drug, means LSD.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And that is a drug that people take that makes them see things.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So it's called a hallucinogenic.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It makes you see crazy things and it was very, very popular in the 1970s.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So that's acid or LSD.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Very good.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here, specifically all the drugs.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why don't we go back to our dialogue?

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's take another listen and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey, man, you want to buy some weed?

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Some what?

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Weed.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, uh, no thanks.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I'm okay, really.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on, man.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I even got dope and acid.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Try some.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you really have all of these drugs?

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Where do you get them from?

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I got my connections.

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hmm.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sounds good.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's see.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I want...

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah?

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are under arrest.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Dope.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, so now in Fluency Builder, we've got a couple of phrases for you about the other side of things.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How to say no to drugs and what you might hear from a police officer like we hear in today's dialogue.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's right.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So the first one we hear is no thanks.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So the guy says, um, no thanks.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He doesn't want the drugs.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So obviously you're being offered something that you don't like.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's take into consideration drugs or maybe somebody wants to offer you a drink or somebody wants to take you on a date.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can say no thanks.

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No thanks.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, hey Marco, you want a drink?

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going to go right now.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's only like two o'clock, but you know, we could go for a drink.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No thanks.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No?

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, okay.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Right.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And now we also have another phrase.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If a person insists, the person is continually insisting like, oh, come on, come on.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on, Marco.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go for a drink.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I really want a drink.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Come with me.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Right.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And you can say, no, I'm okay.

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Really.

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So it may sound confusing.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am okay.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because that would mean you're in good health.

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I feel good.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I feel good.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But in this case, when you say to someone, no, I'm okay, you're saying, no, I'm fine the way I am.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't really need to do anything.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't need it.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So I'm okay means I don't need it.

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And this is a great way to really say, listen, no, I don't want it.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So those are the two ways that we have in which you can say no.

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're going to give you a couple of more towards the end of the lesson.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But let's take a look very quickly at our next phrase.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When the police officer said you are under arrest.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All right.

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So the man didn't know the person didn't know this was a police officer.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And finally, in the end, he says, you are under arrest.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So this is something you hear in the movies when they put the handcuffs on somebody.

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The preposition is under.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's strange, but you just have to remember this as a phrase.

184
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You are under arrest.

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I am arresting you.

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That means you are going to the police station with me.

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You broke the law.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Or you can say, oh, Tim is under arrest.

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He's at the police station right now.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay.

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right.

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So we've taken a look at a couple of phrases and a couple of different things.

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why don't we take another short break?

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, man, you want to buy some weed?

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Some what?

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Weed.

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

200
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, uh, no thanks.

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, I'm okay.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Really.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Come on, man.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I even got dope and acid.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Try some.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you really have all of these drugs?

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Where do you get them from?

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I got my connections.

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hmm.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sounds good.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's see.

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I want.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You are under arrest.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Dope.

219
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
All right.

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So obviously a very serious topic, but at the same time, I think very necessary because it may happen or you may hear it in a movie and it's part of the English language.

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, obviously we are not advocating or saying that drugs are good or anything.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We are saying we are giving you the tools so you know how to recognize when somebody is offering you a drug and the way that you can say no.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right.

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So remember that these are things that you might hear when you're in a country like America or England or Australia.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We hope that you don't have to worry about this, but if you do hear it or you hear it in a movie, you will understand it.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But Marker, we had some other ways to say no to drugs, right?

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
To say no to something, to refuse.

228
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So we heard no thanks and I'm okay.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But what are some other ways to say no?

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, for example, if the person also persists or insists, you can say, no, I'm good.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you.

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm good.

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So it doesn't really make sense because you're saying I'm good.

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What does that exactly mean?

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So like Marco, you want a cigarette?

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No, I'm good.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thanks.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So that's a way of saying no thanks.

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No thanks.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm also, I'm cool.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Not saying like, I'm really cool, right?

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's like saying, no, I'm good.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm cool.

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thanks.

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's right.

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm cool.

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Thank you.

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, thank you.

251
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, thank you.

252
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Or as well, you can also just say no, thank you.

253
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think the most clear is no, I don't smoke or no, I don't do drugs.

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yes, exactly.

255
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's the verb that we use when referring to drugs.

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You do drugs.

257
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You don't do drugs.

258
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So he does drugs or don't do drugs.

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You often hear this phrase.

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So you can say, listen, no, no, thank you.

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm cool.

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't do drugs.

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So as we said, this is all the kind of street slaying or colloquial, very common ways of referring to drugs in English.

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So you can keep an eye out for that.

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you hear that in movies now, you know more or less what they're referring to.

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And also, of course, if you have any questions, any comments or any suggestions, we are always available on our website, EnglishPod.com.

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We hope to see you guys there.

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And until next time.

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Bye.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Bye.
