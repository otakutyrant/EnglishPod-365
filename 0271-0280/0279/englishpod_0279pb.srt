00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,359
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,419
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,699
And today we've got a lesson for you that's about an unusual topic, something we've never talked about here on EnglishPod.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,359
That's right.

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:24,760
As you know, in EnglishPod, we like to talk about all sorts of topics, especially topics that are real-life topics, so probably a lot of things that you won't find in your normal English notebooks or English learning books.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,620
That's right.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,500
So we want to tell you in advance, today's lesson is about drugs.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:40,500
So if you're a younger user or you have kids, maybe they shouldn't listen to today's lesson, but you're going to learn a lot of the names for drugs and also how to turn down an offer of drugs.

10
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,100
So let's check out today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the things that you've heard.

11
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:51,840
Hey, man.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,640
You want to buy some weed?

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,880
Some what?

14
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,000
Weed.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,159
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

16
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,319
Oh, uh, no thanks.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,799
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

18
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,760
No, I'm okay, really.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,060
Come on, man.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,239
I even got dope and acid.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,060
Try some.

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,459
Do you really have all of these drugs?

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,340
Where do you get them from?

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,140
I got my connections.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,099
Just tell me what you want, and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,980
Hmm, sounds good.

27
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,239
Let's see.

28
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,900
I want...

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,400
Yeah?

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,859
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,219
You are under arrest.

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:33,900
Dope!

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,519
Alright, we're back.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:52,879
So as Catherine mentioned, obviously everywhere in the world maybe most likely you've been offered drugs, so we're not only going to talk about drugs, but we're also going to give you some vocab in English how to reject or turn down the offer of drugs.

35
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:00,040
And now what we're going to take a look at, let's start in language takeaway with some of the names of these drugs in English.

36
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,400
Language takeaway.

37
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,240
Okay, so we're in language takeaway here, and I want to warn you, some of these words are slang.

38
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,039
That means they're not words from like a dictionary.

39
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:19,699
These are words people use when they're talking to each other in daily life, or words that you hear on the street.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,120
That's right.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,780
You may even hear them a lot in movies as well.

42
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,960
Yes, movies and TV.

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,840
So this first one, weed, is something...

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,020
There's even a TV show called Weeds.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,759
That's right, that talks about this topic.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,900
So weed is the street name or the most common name for the drug marijuana.

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,599
That's right.

48
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,219
Marijuana is the drug name, but there are many, many, many other names in English that you'll hear.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,180
So weed is one of them.

50
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,800
A weed is a kind of thing that grows, like grass or a flower, that you cut because you don't want it.

51
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:50,300
It's bad.

52
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,180
It smells bad.

53
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:51,840
That's right.

54
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,680
That's exactly right.

55
00:02:52,939 --> 00:03:01,360
So the colloquial name for marijuana is weed, and obviously the person that's being offered these drugs doesn't understand what that means.

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,620
So he goes on and he gives a couple of different other street names for the same drug.

57
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,520
So the first one, so the next one is pot.

58
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:10,419
That's right.

59
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:15,879
So he says pot or ganja or Mary Jane or even chronic.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,159
So all of these are synonyms.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,900
They mean exactly the same thing.

62
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,319
They all mean marijuana.

63
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:21,120
Okay.

64
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,620
But then after that, the drug dealer offers other kinds of drugs.

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,319
He says blow.

66
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,580
So now we may know the verb to blow, right?

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,180
That's right.

68
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:32,979
To blow air.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
But in this case, it's a noun.

70
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:35,599
Okay.

71
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,439
So he says, I have blow.

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,539
That's right.

73
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:41,419
So he's offering this drug called blow.

74
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,159
And what is blow?

75
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,340
Blow is the street name for cocaine.

76
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,960
So there's a very famous movie called Blow, and it was about selling cocaine.

77
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,280
So after he talks about having blow, he also says if you want to do a few lines.

78
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,240
And so this is what you'll commonly hear people saying how they do this drug.

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,039
That's right.

80
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,860
So for example, you may know that many drugs, they're consumed in different ways.

81
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,800
For example, weed.

82
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,620
People smoke it, right?

83
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:14,719
In this case, when we're talking about cocaine or blow, then that's why he refers to do a few lines.

84
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,120
All right.

85
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,160
Because people breathe it in through their nose.

86
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,240
That's right.

87
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:23,480
So that's the colloquial way of saying of how you say that, how you consume this drug.

88
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,120
Okay.

89
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,519
So moving along, there's two more drugs that got mentioned in today's dialogue.

90
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,279
They're dope and acid.

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,100
Now dope can mean two different things.

92
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,639
Sometimes it means marijuana, like some of those other words we heard earlier, but sometimes it also means a very, very serious drug called crack cocaine.

93
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:39,439
Okay.

94
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,560
And that's something that people breathe in and it's very, very addictive.

95
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,740
Yeah, that's right.

96
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:52,199
And also the other word that we have there or the other drug, acid, you may know the word acid is a very harmful substance.

97
00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:01,500
Like for example, batteries, they have a certain type of acid that, for example, will melt metal or if it gets on your skin, it will burn you.

98
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,120
That's right.

99
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,959
But acid, when it's a drug, means LSD.

100
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,939
And that is a drug that people take that makes them see things.

101
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,959
So it's called a hallucinogenic.

102
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,180
It makes you see crazy things and it was very, very popular in the 1970s.

103
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:15,779
That's right.

104
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,420
So that's acid or LSD.

105
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,420
Very good.

106
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:23,180
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here, specifically all the drugs.

107
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,899
Why don't we go back to our dialogue?

108
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,980
Let's take another listen and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

109
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,519
Hey, man, you want to buy some weed?

110
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,759
Some what?

111
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:38,819
Weed.

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,019
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,180
Oh, uh, no thanks.

114
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,639
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,620
No, I'm okay, really.

116
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,920
Come on, man.

117
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,079
I even got dope and acid.

118
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,920
Try some.

119
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,319
Do you really have all of these drugs?

120
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,199
Where do you get them from?

121
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,000
I got my connections.

122
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,959
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

123
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,839
Hmm.

124
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,819
Sounds good.

125
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,100
Let's see.

126
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,720
I want...

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,240
Yeah?

128
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,740
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,079
You are under arrest.

130
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Dope.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,920
Okay, so now in Fluency Builder, we've got a couple of phrases for you about the other side of things.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,379
How to say no to drugs and what you might hear from a police officer like we hear in today's dialogue.

133
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,180
That's right.

134
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,120
So, let's take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,439
So the first one we hear is no thanks.

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,740
So the guy says, um, no thanks.

137
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,920
He doesn't want the drugs.

138
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,600
That's right.

139
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,759
So obviously you're being offered something that you don't like.

140
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,920
Let's take into consideration drugs or maybe somebody wants to offer you a drink or somebody wants to take you on a date.

141
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:00,339
You can say no thanks.

142
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:00,939
No thanks.

143
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,100
So, hey Marco, you want a drink?

144
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:03,920
I'm going to go right now.

145
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,300
It's only like two o'clock, but you know, we could go for a drink.

146
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,199
No thanks.

147
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:07,779
No?

148
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,500
Oh, okay.

149
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,399
Right.

150
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,379
And now we also have another phrase.

151
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:16,360
If a person insists, the person is continually insisting like, oh, come on, come on.

152
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,980
Come on, Marco.

153
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,879
Let's go for a drink.

154
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:18,920
I really want a drink.

155
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,620
Come with me.

156
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:19,959
Right.

157
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,399
And you can say, no, I'm okay.

158
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,980
Really.

159
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:24,579
So it may sound confusing.

160
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,519
I am okay.

161
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,259
Because that would mean you're in good health.

162
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:28,779
I feel good.

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,399
I feel good.

164
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:35,500
But in this case, when you say to someone, no, I'm okay, you're saying, no, I'm fine the way I am.

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,180
I don't really need to do anything.

166
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,379
I don't need it.

167
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:38,759
That's right.

168
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,600
So I'm okay means I don't need it.

169
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:41,279
All right.

170
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,800
And this is a great way to really say, listen, no, I don't want it.

171
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:45,540
Okay.

172
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,519
So those are the two ways that we have in which you can say no.

173
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,560
We're going to give you a couple of more towards the end of the lesson.

174
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,160
But let's take a look very quickly at our next phrase.

175
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
When the police officer said you are under arrest.

176
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,459
All right.

177
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,680
So the man didn't know the person didn't know this was a police officer.

178
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
And finally, in the end, he says, you are under arrest.

179
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,439
That's right.

180
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:07,959
Okay.

181
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,439
So this is something you hear in the movies when they put the handcuffs on somebody.

182
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,720
The preposition is under.

183
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,720
It's strange, but you just have to remember this as a phrase.

184
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,100
You are under arrest.

185
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,500
I am arresting you.

186
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,300
That means you are going to the police station with me.

187
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,220
You broke the law.

188
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:24,699
Right.

189
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,819
Or you can say, oh, Tim is under arrest.

190
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,379
He's at the police station right now.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,300
Okay.

192
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:31,139
All right.

193
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,039
So we've taken a look at a couple of phrases and a couple of different things.

194
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,820
Why don't we take another short break?

195
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,179
Let's listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

196
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,679
Hey, man, you want to buy some weed?

197
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,919
Some what?

198
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,000
Weed.

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,200
You know, pot, ganja, Mary Jane, some chronic.

200
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,360
Oh, uh, no thanks.

201
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,820
I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.

202
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,220
No, I'm okay.

203
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:02,779
Really.

204
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:04,080
Come on, man.

205
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,259
I even got dope and acid.

206
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,100
Try some.

207
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,480
Do you really have all of these drugs?

208
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,360
Where do you get them from?

209
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,179
I got my connections.

210
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,120
Just tell me what you want and I'll even give you an ounce for free.

211
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,019
Hmm.

212
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,000
Sounds good.

213
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,279
Let's see.

214
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:21,440
I want.

215
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,399
Yeah.

216
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,940
I want you to put your hands behind your head.

217
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,279
You are under arrest.

218
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:26,899
Dope.

219
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,919
All right.

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,220
So obviously a very serious topic, but at the same time, I think very necessary because it may happen or you may hear it in a movie and it's part of the English language.

221
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,399
Now, obviously we are not advocating or saying that drugs are good or anything.

222
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,259
We are saying we are giving you the tools so you know how to recognize when somebody is offering you a drug and the way that you can say no.

223
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,120
That's right.

224
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,820
So remember that these are things that you might hear when you're in a country like America or England or Australia.

225
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:05,679
We hope that you don't have to worry about this, but if you do hear it or you hear it in a movie, you will understand it.

226
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,159
But Marker, we had some other ways to say no to drugs, right?

227
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,580
To say no to something, to refuse.

228
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:15,519
So we heard no thanks and I'm okay.

229
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,460
But what are some other ways to say no?

230
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:22,960
Well, for example, if the person also persists or insists, you can say, no, I'm good.

231
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,639
Thank you.

232
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,600
I'm good.

233
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

234
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,799
So it doesn't really make sense because you're saying I'm good.

235
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,980
What does that exactly mean?

236
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,840
So like Marco, you want a cigarette?

237
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,940
No, I'm good.

238
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,279
Thanks.

239
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:33,860
Okay.

240
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,200
So that's a way of saying no thanks.

241
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:35,960
No thanks.

242
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,779
I'm also, I'm cool.

243
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,840
Not saying like, I'm really cool, right?

244
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,600
It's like saying, no, I'm good.

245
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,320
I'm cool.

246
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:43,820
Thanks.

247
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,299
That's right.

248
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:44,740
I'm cool.

249
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:45,919
Thank you.

250
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,460
No, thank you.

251
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,779
No, thank you.

252
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,299
Or as well, you can also just say no, thank you.

253
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,220
I think the most clear is no, I don't smoke or no, I don't do drugs.

254
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,500
Yes, exactly.

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,799
That's the verb that we use when referring to drugs.

256
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,299
You do drugs.

257
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,820
You don't do drugs.

258
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,059
So he does drugs or don't do drugs.

259
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,279
You often hear this phrase.

260
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,480
So you can say, listen, no, no, thank you.

261
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,120
I'm cool.

262
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,440
I don't do drugs.

263
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,120
That's right.

264
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:22,200
So as we said, this is all the kind of street slaying or colloquial, very common ways of referring to drugs in English.

265
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,259
So you can keep an eye out for that.

266
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,700
If you hear that in movies now, you know more or less what they're referring to.

267
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:34,799
And also, of course, if you have any questions, any comments or any suggestions, we are always available on our website, EnglishPod.com.

268
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:36,200
We hope to see you guys there.

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
And until next time.

270
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:37,919
Bye.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,399
Bye.
