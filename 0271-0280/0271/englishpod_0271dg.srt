EnglishPod.com Thank you, Jonathan.

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It has been three years since I visited Beijing and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So congratulations to all of you.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line.

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How the whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.
