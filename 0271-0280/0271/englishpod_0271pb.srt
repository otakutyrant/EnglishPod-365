00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have the beginning of a very long series on giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So this series is at the intermediate level, right, Marco?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's part of our business series.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We previously took a look at how to go upon an interview.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now we're going to talk about presentation, so everything about a presentation, how to give a presentation, language you can use in a presentation, and a lot of other things like this.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So today we're going to talk about the very beginning of a presentation.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's take a listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you, Jonathan.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So congratulations to all of you.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right, we're back.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So as you can see, it's the very beginning of a presentation.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We're kind of starting to give people an idea of what we're going to talk about.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So let's take a look at some of the language Mr.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Ford used on language takeaway.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Language takeaway.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So the reason Mr.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ford is giving a presentation is because he wants to talk about the company's new line of computers, right?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And so he says that they're going to launch a new line of desktop and laptop computers.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So they want to launch a new line of laptops.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So this verb, to launch, means to bring out to the market.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's right.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So instead of the word to start, which you could use in many different ways, like to start eating or to start swimming, in this case, to launch means you're going to introduce a new product to the market, like you said, Marco.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We are going to start selling to the market a new product.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We're going to launch a new line of laptop and desktop computers.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
For example, this spring, Steve Jobs launched the iPad, which is a new product.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So he launched the iPad and the iPhone 4.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They're always launching new things at Apple.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All right.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So since they're launching this new line of laptop and desktop computers, Mr.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ford first wanted to give a brief overview of the marketing campaign.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So first of all, we're going to talk about how this product is being marketed.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So you want to give a general picture or a very simple picture of what's going to happen.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So at the beginning, this will happen.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Then this will happen.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
At the end, this will happen.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that's what we call an overview.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So it's a brief or general idea of what we're talking about, an overview, nothing too specific.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We just want to give you a general idea.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
After that, Mr.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ford starts talking and he's talking about the presentation, which has many parts.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And he wants to talk about what each part will contain.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So he says, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So this verb, to touch on, what does this mean?

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So when he says he wants to touch on the background of this new computer, he's basically saying, I want to talk about.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
All right.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So this is potentially very confusing because we know the word to touch means to put your hand on something, but to touch on, this is a phrasal verb.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This means to talk about or to address.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So for example, a teacher at a university will touch on many topics during his lecture.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Or I'd like to touch on where we're going to dinner tonight because I'm very hungry.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So basically it's a nice way of saying I want to talk about this topic.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And then apart from touching on the background of the new computer, he said he also wants to talk about projected sales for this new computer.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So projected sales, this phrase includes two words.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sales means how much of something you sell, obviously, but projected means what you expect to sell.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So the projected sales have not happened yet.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
They will happen in the future.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so they're basically my guess about sales.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So basically we are giving an estimate of what we think we will sell.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Those are projected sales.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We think we will sell a thousand computers.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Those are our projected sales.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And after that, we have one more key word.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This word comes at the very end of the speech.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mr.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ford says we will then go on to discuss our key rivals.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Now who is a rival, Marco?

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So a rival is basically your competitor or maybe kind of your enemy.

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So computers, who is Apple's rival?

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Maybe HP or IBM or Dell.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Very good.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So a rival is someone you compete with.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's right.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So he's going to talk about his key rivals.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So basically the word key is your most important rivals.

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So for example, who is one of Batman's key rivals?

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because we have rivals not just in business, but also in life.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's right.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So for example, I think maybe Batman's key rival might be the Joker.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Or the Penguin.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Or the Penguin.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So let's take another listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment with some very important phrases.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hi, everyone.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can everyone hear me?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for alpha computers.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We have bounced back from the recession, and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for alpha computers, who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign and to answer any questions you may have.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ford.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you, Jonathan.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So congratulations to all of you.

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right, so we've prepared three phrases for you.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So this first phrase is really important because it's about the part of the speech that happens before the speech begins.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You know, usually you have a person who's going to talk about something, but you also have someone who introduces that person.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is John.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's going to talk about computers.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He's very smart.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Listen to everything he says.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So we usually hear the phrase, let's give a warm welcome to.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes, this is a very nice way of presenting someone.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So obviously this person is talking to a group of people, and he's introducing Mr.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ford.

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So he says, let's give a warm welcome to Mr.

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ford.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So that's saying, let's clap, let's say hello to him.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's right.

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So like you said, this is an invitation to clap.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You have to clap when you hear this.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Warm welcome means let's be nice to him.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's all smile and encourage him.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You know, you think about it.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Someone who's going to give a speech is probably nervous, and so this helps them feel comfortable.

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's right.

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So it's a very nice way if you're maybe presenting someone who's going to talk, you can say, let's give a warm welcome to whoever you're presenting.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, now when Mr.

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Ford was talking, he mentioned this very interesting phrase about operations.

157
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He said, it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay, so that means things are going well.

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You do one thing, you do it well.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You move on to another thing, you do that well as well.

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, so that's what it means, from strength to strength.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So we're saying that things are going from good to better.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And getting better.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And what about our last phrase?

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Our last phrase is kind of similar to the last one.

168
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All right, so you can have a company that grows, it grows a little.

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can have a company that grows quite a bit, then you have a company that grows in leaps and bounds.

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That means a lot.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay, so to leap is to jump, right?

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's right.

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And so this is what we're saying, we're just jumping higher and higher, we're getting bigger and bigger, or better and better.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's right.

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So this is an exaggeration, it's like saying that it's not going quickly, it's going the speed of light.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You know, it's just so fast, all of a sudden just really growing.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, a lot of interesting phrases there, a lot of key vocab.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think we can listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hi everyone, can everyone hear me?

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

182
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for Alpha Computers.

184
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We have bounced back from the recession, and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for Alpha Computers, who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign, and to answer any questions you may have.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ford.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you, Jonathan.

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So congratulations to all of you!

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon, and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

196
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
All right, so as we mentioned, this is the first part of a ten-part series all about public speaking, giving a presentation.

201
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
We're going to talk about many aspects of a presentation, like charts and graphs and using PowerPoints, all these really modern ways of giving a presentation.

202
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's right, and we're going to try and talk to you about some of the places in presentations that English learners tend to struggle with.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know, it's sometimes very hard to know what to say, especially like in today's lesson.

204
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
How do you introduce someone in a presentation?

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's not very common to learn how to say that, so we hope that through these podcasts, you'll be able to learn some really important phrases and become more comfortable while you're giving presentations in English.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's right.

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And of course, if you have any questions about these lessons or any of our lessons, you can send us also your suggestions about any lesson topics you may have.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's right.

209
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So we hope to hear from you.

210
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Please let us know what you're thinking, and until next time, everyone, bye.
