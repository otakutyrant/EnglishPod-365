00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,259
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,980
My name is Katherine, and today we have the beginning of a very long series on giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,320
So this series is at the intermediate level, right, Marco?

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,080
That's right.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,960
It's part of our business series.

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,280
We previously took a look at how to go upon an interview.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:27,500
Now we're going to talk about presentation, so everything about a presentation, how to give a presentation, language you can use in a presentation, and a lot of other things like this.

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,339
That's right.

10
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:31,379
So today we're going to talk about the very beginning of a presentation.

11
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:34,200
Let's take a listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you, Jonathan.

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,980
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,659
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

15
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,040
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

16
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,379
So congratulations to all of you.

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,120
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,579
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

19
00:01:51,299 --> 00:02:00,019
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,140
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:08,000
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

22
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,500
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,240
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,659
All right, we're back.

25
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,659
So as you can see, it's the very beginning of a presentation.

26
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,879
We're kind of starting to give people an idea of what we're going to talk about.

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,300
So let's take a look at some of the language Mr.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,080
Ford used on language takeaway.

29
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,400
Language takeaway.

30
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,400
So the reason Mr.

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,240
Ford is giving a presentation is because he wants to talk about the company's new line of computers, right?

32
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:52,039
And so he says that they're going to launch a new line of desktop and laptop computers.

33
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:52,960
That's right.

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,979
So they want to launch a new line of laptops.

35
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,360
So this verb, to launch, means to bring out to the market.

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,199
That's right.

37
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:14,500
So instead of the word to start, which you could use in many different ways, like to start eating or to start swimming, in this case, to launch means you're going to introduce a new product to the market, like you said, Marco.

38
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,240
That's right.

39
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,120
We are going to start selling to the market a new product.

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,580
We're going to launch a new line of laptop and desktop computers.

41
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,680
For example, this spring, Steve Jobs launched the iPad, which is a new product.

42
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:29,479
That's right.

43
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,120
So he launched the iPad and the iPhone 4.

44
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,319
They're always launching new things at Apple.

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,099
That's right.

46
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,080
All right.

47
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:42,159
So since they're launching this new line of laptop and desktop computers, Mr.

48
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,319
Ford first wanted to give a brief overview of the marketing campaign.

49
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,159
Okay.

50
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,060
So first of all, we're going to talk about how this product is being marketed.

51
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,719
So you want to give a general picture or a very simple picture of what's going to happen.

52
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,639
So at the beginning, this will happen.

53
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
Then this will happen.

54
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,780
At the end, this will happen.

55
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,219
And that's what we call an overview.

56
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,199
That's right.

57
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,240
So it's a brief or general idea of what we're talking about, an overview, nothing too specific.

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,979
We just want to give you a general idea.

59
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:13,659
That's right.

60
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,060
After that, Mr.

61
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,959
Ford starts talking and he's talking about the presentation, which has many parts.

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
And he wants to talk about what each part will contain.

63
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:27,959
So he says, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line.

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,160
So this verb, to touch on, what does this mean?

65
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:37,720
So when he says he wants to touch on the background of this new computer, he's basically saying, I want to talk about.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:38,459
All right.

67
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:47,279
So this is potentially very confusing because we know the word to touch means to put your hand on something, but to touch on, this is a phrasal verb.

68
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,959
This means to talk about or to address.

69
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:50,660
That's right.

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,180
So for example, a teacher at a university will touch on many topics during his lecture.

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,180
That's right.

72
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,779
Or I'd like to touch on where we're going to dinner tonight because I'm very hungry.

73
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:02,360
Okay.

74
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,120
So basically it's a nice way of saying I want to talk about this topic.

75
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,660
And then apart from touching on the background of the new computer, he said he also wants to talk about projected sales for this new computer.

76
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,420
So projected sales, this phrase includes two words.

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,279
Sales means how much of something you sell, obviously, but projected means what you expect to sell.

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,540
So the projected sales have not happened yet.

79
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,079
They will happen in the future.

80
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,079
And so they're basically my guess about sales.

81
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,060
That's right.

82
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,399
So basically we are giving an estimate of what we think we will sell.

83
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,939
Those are projected sales.

84
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:43,259
We think we will sell a thousand computers.

85
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,540
Those are our projected sales.

86
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,699
And after that, we have one more key word.

87
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,579
This word comes at the very end of the speech.

88
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:52,819
Mr.

89
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,339
Ford says we will then go on to discuss our key rivals.

90
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,000
Now who is a rival, Marco?

91
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:58,439
Okay.

92
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,519
So a rival is basically your competitor or maybe kind of your enemy.

93
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:04,560
All right.

94
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,779
So computers, who is Apple's rival?

95
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,899
Maybe HP or IBM or Dell.

96
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,019
Very good.

97
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,920
So a rival is someone you compete with.

98
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,060
That's right.

99
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,660
So he's going to talk about his key rivals.

100
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,720
So basically the word key is your most important rivals.

101
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:23,779
All right.

102
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,579
So for example, who is one of Batman's key rivals?

103
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:30,600
Because we have rivals not just in business, but also in life.

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,480
That's right.

105
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,699
So for example, I think maybe Batman's key rival might be the Joker.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Or the Penguin.

107
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,399
Or the Penguin.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,180
All right.

109
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,939
So let's take another listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment with some very important phrases.

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,839
Hi, everyone.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,139
Can everyone hear me?

112
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,879
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

113
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,480
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

114
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,879
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for alpha computers.

115
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,720
We have bounced back from the recession, and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.

116
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:19,899
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for alpha computers, who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign and to answer any questions you may have.

117
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,060
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr.

118
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,300
Ford.

119
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,899
Thank you, Jonathan.

120
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,879
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

121
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:35,540
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

122
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,939
The alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

123
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,240
So congratulations to all of you.

124
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:55,040
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

125
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:58,480
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

126
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:07,939
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

127
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:12,000
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

128
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,899
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

129
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,360
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,699
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.

131
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,899
All right, so we've prepared three phrases for you.

132
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,480
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

133
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,360
So this first phrase is really important because it's about the part of the speech that happens before the speech begins.

134
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,580
You know, usually you have a person who's going to talk about something, but you also have someone who introduces that person.

135
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,019
This is John.

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,840
He's going to talk about computers.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,919
He's very smart.

138
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,139
Listen to everything he says.

139
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,879
So we usually hear the phrase, let's give a warm welcome to.

140
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes, this is a very nice way of presenting someone.

141
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:07,759
So obviously this person is talking to a group of people, and he's introducing Mr.

142
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,059
Ford.

143
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,259
So he says, let's give a warm welcome to Mr.

144
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,659
Ford.

145
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:16,139
So that's saying, let's clap, let's say hello to him.

146
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:16,860
That's right.

147
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,659
So like you said, this is an invitation to clap.

148
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,299
You have to clap when you hear this.

149
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,240
Warm welcome means let's be nice to him.

150
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's all smile and encourage him.

151
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,299
You know, you think about it.

152
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,679
Someone who's going to give a speech is probably nervous, and so this helps them feel comfortable.

153
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:32,259
That's right.

154
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,200
So it's a very nice way if you're maybe presenting someone who's going to talk, you can say, let's give a warm welcome to whoever you're presenting.

155
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,179
Okay, now when Mr.

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,820
Ford was talking, he mentioned this very interesting phrase about operations.

157
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,620
He said, it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

158
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,940
Okay, so that means things are going well.

159
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,559
You do one thing, you do it well.

160
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,799
You move on to another thing, you do that well as well.

161
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,100
Okay, so that's what it means, from strength to strength.

162
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,820
So we're saying that things are going from good to better.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,360
That's right.

164
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,940
And getting better.

165
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,379
Okay.

166
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,159
And what about our last phrase?

167
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,659
Our last phrase is kind of similar to the last one.

168
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,080
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds.

169
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,240
All right, so you can have a company that grows, it grows a little.

170
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,899
You can have a company that grows quite a bit, then you have a company that grows in leaps and bounds.

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,120
That means a lot.

172
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,059
Okay, so to leap is to jump, right?

173
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,620
That's right.

174
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:35,500
And so this is what we're saying, we're just jumping higher and higher, we're getting bigger and bigger, or better and better.

175
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,139
That's right.

176
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:42,840
So this is an exaggeration, it's like saying that it's not going quickly, it's going the speed of light.

177
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,039
You know, it's just so fast, all of a sudden just really growing.

178
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,980
Okay, a lot of interesting phrases there, a lot of key vocab.

179
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,299
I think we can listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

180
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,059
Hi everyone, can everyone hear me?

181
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,840
Can you guys at the back hear everything?

182
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,440
I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon.

183
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:13,960
As most of you are aware, 2010 marks an important moment for Alpha Computers.

184
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,720
We have bounced back from the recession, and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.

185
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:30,879
I'm really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the global marketing manager for Alpha Computers, who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign, and to answer any questions you may have.

186
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,039
So please, give a warm welcome to Mr.

187
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,259
Ford.

188
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,860
Thank you, Jonathan.

189
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,840
It really is a pleasure to be here today.

190
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:46,519
It has been three years since I visited Beijing, and it's clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.

191
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,960
The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here.

192
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,440
So congratulations to all of you!

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,039
I'd like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon, and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed.

194
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,440
The presentation today is divided into five main parts.

195
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:18,919
First of all, I'd like to briefly touch on the background of the new X420 line, how the whole concept has come about, and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.

196
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,980
Secondly, I'd like to present data on projected sales for the X420.

197
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:26,879
We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector.

198
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,320
Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the X420.

199
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,159
Finally, I'm happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you may have for me.

200
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:47,840
All right, so as we mentioned, this is the first part of a ten-part series all about public speaking, giving a presentation.

201
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:57,779
We're going to talk about many aspects of a presentation, like charts and graphs and using PowerPoints, all these really modern ways of giving a presentation.

202
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:05,019
That's right, and we're going to try and talk to you about some of the places in presentations that English learners tend to struggle with.

203
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,600
You know, it's sometimes very hard to know what to say, especially like in today's lesson.

204
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,440
How do you introduce someone in a presentation?

205
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:22,799
It's not very common to learn how to say that, so we hope that through these podcasts, you'll be able to learn some really important phrases and become more comfortable while you're giving presentations in English.

206
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:23,500
That's right.

207
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:33,940
And of course, if you have any questions about these lessons or any of our lessons, you can send us also your suggestions about any lesson topics you may have.

208
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:34,460
That's right.

209
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,480
So we hope to hear from you.

210
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,080
Please let us know what you're thinking, and until next time, everyone, bye.
