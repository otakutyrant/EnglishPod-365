00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,560
Hey Lydia, what are you reading?

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,080
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month.

3
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,560
My outlook is very positive.

4
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:19,039
It says that I should take a vacation to some place exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

5
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,039
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,280
Let me see that.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,219
What are horoscopes?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,960
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,039
You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in.

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,759
I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries.

11
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:34,820
When were you born?

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,380
January 5th.

13
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,479
Let's see, you're a Capricorn.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,700
It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you could see new exciting developments in your love life.

15
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,979
Looks like we'll both have interesting summers.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,200
That's bogus.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,840
I don't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically non-existent.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,159
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

19
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:57,359
No it's not.

20
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,799
Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality.

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,439
See it says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,159
Well you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

23
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,040
What does it say about me?

24
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,280
A Capricorn is serious minded and practical.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,900
She likes to do things in conventional ways.

26
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,859
That sounds just like you.
