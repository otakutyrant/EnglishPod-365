00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,660
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,379
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and we're talking about the stars today.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,640
That's right.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,660
Today we're going to talk about a very popular subject many people believe in, the horoscope.

6
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:21,539
So a horoscope is basically a system, a very old system, of determining your future and describing your personality.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
And so it all depends on when you were born and where you were born.

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,559
So what stars were in the sky when you were born.

9
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,199
That's right.

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,500
So basically, as many of you may know, there are 12, there are 12 signs.

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:46,880
And we're going to talk about a couple of them and a little bit more about horoscopes and this, I don't know, I guess it's kind of like a branch of science or pseudoscience.

12
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,060
Yeah, I don't think there's much testing that's going on, but it's definitely something that a lot of people believe in.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,179
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,900
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?

15
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,439
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month.

16
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,879
My outlook is very positive.

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,400
It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,340
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,620
Let me see that.

20
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,540
What are horoscopes?

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,299
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign.

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,379
You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in.

23
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,120
I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries.

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,180
When were you born?

25
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:32,739
January 5th.

26
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,819
Let's see, you're a Capricorn.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,060
It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you could see new exciting developments in your love life.

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,319
Looks like we'll both have interesting summers.

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,540
That's bogus.

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,180
I don't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically non-existent.

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,500
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,700
No, it's not.

33
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,140
Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,760
See, it says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,480
Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

36
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:09,379
What does it say about me?

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,620
A Capricorn is serious minded and practical.

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,240
She likes to do things in conventional ways.

39
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,379
That sounds just like you.

40
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,039
All right, we're back.

41
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,979
So a very interesting dialogue between these two girls talking about one of them believing in the horoscope and the other one doesn't.

42
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,639
But they mentioned a lot of interesting things, so we're going to have two language takeaways today.

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,659
Let's start with language takeaway part one.

44
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:39,719
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:50,800
All right, so one of the most common things you'll hear when we talk about the horoscope in English is an outlook, and an outlook can be positive or negative.

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
So what exactly is an outlook?

47
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,759
Well, if you notice, Lydia said, my outlook is very positive.

48
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,379
So basically, she's talking about her future, right?

49
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:06,020
So the way that she sees the future or the way that the horoscope talks about the future is a positive one.

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:14,719
So you could say, you know those, you know, those eight balls, they're black, and they have like a message and you shake it and it gives you a message, ask a question, ask a question.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,740
It says outlook positive, that's right outlook negatives.

52
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,680
That means in your near future, things will either be positive or negative.

53
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:31,460
So I guess you can apply it, for example, to a company, you say that a company has a positive outlook, or even a person, you know, he's very positive person.

54
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,300
So he has a positive outlook, he thinks good things are going to happen.

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Okay, very good.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,960
So talking about horoscopes, obviously, we must mention the 12 zodiac signs.

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:50,740
Okay, so each month has its own sign, and they're not exactly the months, they're a each sign is a kind of an animal or a symbol.

58
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,180
That's right.

59
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,680
So for example, a lot of August is part of the Leo sign in English.

60
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,639
That's the lion.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,439
And so the lion is the animal, the zodiac.

62
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,319
So the the zodiac sign is one of the signs like Leo is one of the zodiac signs.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,340
And I guess the all 12 signs are considered the zodiac or the horoscope.

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,199
Exactly.

65
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,060
And you can actually talk about the zodiac in terms of other cultures.

66
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,819
There is a Chinese zodiac.

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,040
So we could say it's the year of the horse.

68
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,040
But that's a little bit different from what we're talking about here with the Western horoscope.

69
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,279
Okay, very good.

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:35,939
So all of this actually comes down to the, as we say, the pseudoscience or the branch called astrology, astrology.

71
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,319
So this is a very hard word for some people to remember because they want to say astronomy.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,579
But it's different.

73
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:48,199
Astronomy is the scientific study of the skies, the stars, planets, things like that.

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,660
Astrology is different.

75
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:59,199
It's what we're talking about here, the horoscope, and reading the stars to understand what our personal futures will hold for us.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,819
That's right.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,240
So astronomy is an exact science part of I guess, physics, where you talk about the stars or the composition of the stars and their movements.

78
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:17,699
Whereas in astrology, we're talking about zodiacs and horoscopes and basically what star was in the sky when you were born, but in a different way.

79
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,899
It's not very scientific.

80
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:19,879
That's right.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,720
So astrology is normally what you would see in the newspaper when you're trying to find your horoscope, astrology or horoscope.

82
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:38,339
And actually every time you read the newspaper, if you look up your zodiac sign, it makes a prediction about your day or your week or maybe even sometimes a month or year.

83
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:38,939
That's right.

84
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,339
And so a prediction is basically a guess about what will happen for you.

85
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,000
That's right.

86
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,160
So many times you see that the horoscope will say, finances are in trouble.

87
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,300
Be careful with how you spend your money.

88
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,279
So they're making a prediction that in the future, maybe you're going to have money problems.

89
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:57,180
So you have to be careful.

90
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:57,699
Exactly.

91
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,600
Or in the dialogue, you will have a passionate summer fling.

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,540
This is a prediction.

93
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,040
It has not yet happened.

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,800
It will happen.

95
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:04,660
That's right.

96
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,480
That's right.

97
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,139
A prediction.

98
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:14,740
So now talking a little bit more about the zodiac signs that we saw in the dialogue, we mentioned two, Aries and Capricorn.

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,779
So a lot of people who believe in astrology say that astrological signs are broken up.

100
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,839
They're divided into different kinds of sign.

101
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,199
We have water signs, air signs, earth signs and fire signs.

102
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:31,319
One of the famous fire signs is Aries, right?

103
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:32,600
Aries.

104
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,019
It's like the god of war in the Greek mythology.

105
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,160
That's right.

106
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:42,139
And so it's pronounced Aries, Aries, A-R-I-E-S, Aries.

107
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:42,579
That's right.

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
And the other one is a Capricorn.

109
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:45,759
Capricorn.

110
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,100
So that's like a goat?

111
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,540
Yeah.

112
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,459
It's kind of like a ram.

113
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,019
A ram.

114
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,139
So an earth sign.

115
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,959
That's right.

116
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,459
So there are 12.

117
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,660
These are just two of them.

118
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,660
And obviously there are a lot more, I guess, off the top of my head.

119
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,660
We have Taurus or Leo.

120
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,180
There's also a Scorpio.

121
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:05,339
Sagittarius.

122
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,319
Sagittarius.

123
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:06,920
Gemini.

124
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,639
Gemini, which are like twins, twin people.

125
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,199
There's Pisces.

126
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,779
Virgo.

127
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,339
And Virgo the Virgin.

128
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,240
And I don't know if we're missing anything.

129
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,240
I can't think now.

130
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,959
We'll have to talk about it at the very end of today's lesson.

131
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,779
But we actually have some interesting things to talk about in a minute here.

132
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:30,480
We have to talk about the personality characteristics that are common when you're talking about different zodiac signs.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,319
Okay.

134
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,839
So before we get to that, let's listen to our dialogue again.

135
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:42,639
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?

136
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,180
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month.

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,639
My outlook is very positive.

138
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,120
It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

139
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,079
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,339
Let me see that.

141
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,300
What are horoscopes?

142
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,019
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign.

143
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,120
You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in.

144
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,819
I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries.

145
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,899
When were you born?

146
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,459
January 5th.

147
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,339
Let's see.

148
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,560
You're a Capricorn.

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,779
It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you could see new exciting developments in your love life.

150
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,060
Looks like we'll both have interesting summers.

151
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,279
That's bogus.

152
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,899
I don't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically non-existent.

153
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,259
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,420
No, it's not.

155
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality.

156
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,460
See, it says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

157
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:45,220
Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

158
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,120
What does it say about me?

159
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,360
A Capricorn is serious minded and practical.

160
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,980
She likes to do things in conventional ways.

161
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,919
That sounds just like you.

162
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,620
All right, we're back.

163
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,019
So now let's take a look at these personality traits on Language Takeaway Part 2.

164
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,960
Language Takeaway.

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,879
All right, so one of the great words that we heard in today's dialogue was exotic.

166
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,360
Okay, and this is not necessarily describing a person, but usually things or clothes or places.

167
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,720
And in this instance, it was some place exotic.

168
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,379
That's right.

169
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,600
What's an exotic place?

170
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:34,759
It's basically a place that's very unique and I guess it's kind of not common to go there or to find.

171
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:40,899
For example, many people talk about an exotic getaway going to the jungle because it's so exotic.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,620
You have so many strange animals and plants and everything is so unfamiliar.

173
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,000
So in my mind, Tahiti is very exotic.

174
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:48,840
All right.

175
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:55,639
It's full of jungle and there's also beaches and it's very unusual for someone who's from America because it's just so far away.

176
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,379
That's right.

177
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,120
Exotic.

178
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,899
So someone can also have an exotic personality because maybe they're a little bit strange or not strange, but not so common.

179
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:05,559
Maybe unique.

180
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah, although exotic is usually kind of a sexy thing when you're talking about people.

181
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:10,960
That's right.

182
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:12,360
You know, she looks very exotic.

183
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,700
That means she doesn't look like everybody else here.

184
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:15,539
That's right.

185
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,600
But another adjective to describe someone's personality is somebody that's very energetic.

186
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,539
All right.

187
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,059
So energetic sounds like the word energy.

188
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,600
That's because they're related.

189
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,679
And so someone who is energetic has lots of energy.

190
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:37,200
He or she likes to do a lot of things and wants to always go places and you know the energetic person at your office.

191
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,580
They always drink coffee.

192
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,340
That's right.

193
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:42,320
Maybe they make everyone else really tired just listening to them.

194
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:43,320
That's right.

195
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:48,340
And actually a person that's energetic usually also loves to socialize.

196
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,100
That's right.

197
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,480
So loves to means they like to, but they like it a lot, right?

198
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,899
But to socialize means to talk to other people or to go to parties or to meet new people.

199
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,080
So if it's a verb, to socialize means to talk to people, to meet people, to greet people.

200
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,159
You love to have contact with other people.

201
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,639
So yeah, you're right.

202
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,480
Very, very common for people who are energetic.

203
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:11,259
Okay.

204
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,360
And what about someone that's practical?

205
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,259
What is that like?

206
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,159
Someone who is practical does a lot of things.

207
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,039
Someone who's practical always comes to their activities prepared.

208
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,460
So in my car, I'm very practical.

209
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:30,679
I have extra water and a spare tire, but you can also say, I'm a very practical person.

210
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,580
I like to do things that I can achieve as opposed to someone who always wants to do things that they can't really achieve.

211
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,759
So a practical person is usually very realistic and very down to earth.

212
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,320
Maybe someone that's practical, if they're going on a trip, they'll only take what's necessary, not more than they need.

213
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,279
Yeah, exactly.

214
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,279
Let me give you a good example.

215
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,759
I like to go hiking and sometimes I see women who have not made very practical decisions about the shoes they wear.

216
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,539
So I like to wear hiking boots.

217
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,639
These are very practical.

218
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,039
Wearing high heels on a mountain is not very practical.

219
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,860
That's right.

220
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:08,299
Okay.

221
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,519
Very good.

222
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,419
Now we also mentioned that a Capricorn is serious minded and conventional in many ways.

223
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,039
Someone who's serious minded maybe doesn't like to have fun and go out and do things that are silly.

224
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:31,899
Someone who's serious minded is usually very practical, I think, and really has a goal, wants to achieve that goal.

225
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,820
No time to be silly, no time to make jokes.

226
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:41,879
So it doesn't necessarily mean that the person is boring, but they're just very, as you said, That's right.

227
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:46,879
And what about that a Capricorn also likes to do things in conventional ways?

228
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,139
All right, so conventional means, doing something in a conventional way means that you're doing it in a traditional way.

229
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,440
So this is a thing we've always done.

230
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,240
We've always done it in this way, and I'm going to continue to do it in this way.

231
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,100
So the opposite is unconventional.

232
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,340
That means doing things in new ways, doing things with your imagination.

233
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,600
And so something that's very conventional is something that, you know, has been established and we're just going to continue doing it that way.

234
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:21,779
So for example, someone that gets married in a church is the conventional way, but someone that gets married while skydiving is very unconventional.

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,500
That's right.

236
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,519
Unconventional.

237
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,200
Absolutely.

238
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,159
Very good.

239
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,620
So a lot of great vocab here.

240
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,559
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

241
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,460
Hey, Lydia, what are you reading?

242
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm looking at my horoscope for this month.

243
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,460
My outlook is very positive.

244
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,980
It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic and that I will have a passionate summer fling.

245
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,899
What are you talking about?

246
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:53,179
Let me see that.

247
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,139
What are horoscopes?

248
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:58,860
It's a prediction of your month based on your zodiac sign.

249
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,940
You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in.

250
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,679
I was born on April 15th, so I'm an Aries.

251
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,740
When were you born?

252
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,340
January 5th.

253
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,399
Let's see, you're a Capricorn.

254
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:15,620
It says that you'll be feeling stress at work, but you could see new exciting developments in your love life.

255
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,899
Looks like we'll both have interesting summers.

256
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,120
That's bogus.

257
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,759
I don't feel any stress at work and my love life is practically non-existent.

258
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,080
This zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.

259
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:28,279
No, it's not.

260
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,720
Your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality.

261
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,320
See, it says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize.

262
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,059
Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they're so broad they could apply to anyone.

263
00:14:42,659 --> 00:14:43,960
What does it say about me?

264
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,200
A Capricorn is serious minded and practical.

265
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,820
She likes to do things in conventional ways.

266
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,960
That sounds just like you.

267
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,019
All right, so talk about the horoscopes.

268
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,779
Which sign are you?

269
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm a Leo, which is actually, I don't believe in the horoscope, but I have to say every time someone tells me about Leos, Leo the lion, right?

270
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:12,720
I agree with most of their descriptions of my personality, so outspoken.

271
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:19,539
Loves to socialize, very opinionated, which means I have an opinion and I don't like to listen to other people.

272
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:21,879
Loves to argue, very loud.

273
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,840
So these are all qualities that I think I have and some of them are bad, some of them are good, but you know, that's the way it is.

274
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:35,960
So, but you don't really believe in what magazines or newspapers say about your outlook.

275
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,100
Nah, I don't, yeah, the predictions are usually just basic guesses.

276
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,860
But what about you?

277
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,620
What's your sign?

278
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,899
I am a Taurus, so I was born in May.

279
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:47,799
A bull.

280
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:48,879
A bull, yes.

281
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,519
So I'm very stubborn and very strong.

282
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,940
I don't really know what all the characteristics about the Taurus are.

283
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,659
Opinionated.

284
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,220
Opinionated, I know that it's stubborn.

285
00:15:59,220 --> 00:15:59,460
Loves to argue.

286
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,200
Yeah, exactly.

287
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:01,379
Doesn't like to be corrected.

288
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,279
Are you describing Taurus or are you describing me?

289
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:17,320
All right, so it's actually very interesting, I think in many ways sometimes the glove does fit and someone's zodiac sign describes them very well.

290
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:23,940
But again, maybe like the dialogue says, they are very broad descriptions that basically any person can relate to.

291
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:30,519
Absolutely, I think that that's one of the tricks to horoscopes or to predicting someone's future.

292
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,519
You tell them enough very vague things that maybe some of them will fit and some of them won't.

293
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,220
That's right.

294
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,340
But I'm very curious to hear about you guys.

295
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,759
What are your signs?

296
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:42,940
What's your sign?

297
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,580
That means what's your zodiac sign?

298
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,139
That's right.

299
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,659
That's actually also a very common date question.

300
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,899
People say, oh, what's your sign?

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,840
Or a pickup line.

302
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,600
Or a pickup line.

303
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,460
Hey, baby, what's your sign?

304
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,100
To see if you're compatible, right?

305
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:54,559
Right.

306
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,159
So let us know.

307
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,539
We're not trying to pick you up.

308
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,220
We're just curious.

309
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,399
You'll find a lot of the words for the zodiac in today's lesson on our website, EnglishPod.com.

310
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:03,659
All right.

311
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,299
We'll see you guys there.

312
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:04,640
Bye.
