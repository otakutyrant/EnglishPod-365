00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:03,940
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,320
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:11,099
And today's show is a continuation of our series about giving a presentation in English.

5
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,900
So we're talking about a special line of computers here.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,619
That's right.

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,859
And on this occasion, we're going to compare two companies.

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,239
So we're going to try to tell everyone what the difference is between our company and the competitors.

9
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:23,219
All right.

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,760
So we learned a lot of great phrases and words for making comparisons in last week's show.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,399
You're going to hear some of these again.

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:30,859
Let's listen to the dialogue.

13
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,820
Now of course, with all this cutting edge technology, there must be a catch, you might ask yourself.

14
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,700
I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might say.

15
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,179
Well, you'd be wrong.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,600
Yes, of course, the X420 is aimed at the luxury market.

17
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:57,460
But if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the X420 represents incredible value for money.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:04,439
At only 15,000 RMB, it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every leading brand and model.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,939
So what differentiates us from our competitors?

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,079
Well, if we compare Orange's luxury MP40 range, then we can really highlight some of the differences.

21
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,599
Now, of course, Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class products.

22
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,299
And I must admit, the MP40 is a breathtaking machine.

23
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,060
However, for most consumers, the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.

24
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:39,680
Compared with the X420, it is more expensive and there's no doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the X420, we really win hands down on value for money.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,060
Also, if you compare the after-sales service we offer, I think we can proudly boast the best customer service facilities in the whole laptop sector.

26
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,099
As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service, and we guarantee reliability.

27
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,319
The questions we must ask ourselves are, what does the Alpha brand stand for?

28
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,620
And also, how can we set ourselves apart from our competitors?

29
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,379
The answer to both of these questions is the same, my friends.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,300
Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence, and for service.

31
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:18,939
If we always stick to this philosophy, then I'm confident that we will really be able to expand our market share significantly.

32
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:24,280
Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the X420.

33
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:36,659
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at these phrases on language takeaway.

34
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,280
Our first phrase comes from the very first sentence of today's dialogue.

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,860
We heard this phrase, cutting-edge technology.

36
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:51,699
Now, Marco, what does cutting-edge mean?

37
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,439
Okay, so as you see in the dialogue, we're talking about technology.

38
00:02:55,699 --> 00:03:03,020
And if technology is cutting-edge, it basically means it's new, it's very modern, it's the newest you can get.

39
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,280
It's the most advanced, perhaps.

40
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,240
That's right.

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,560
So, what's an example of a current cutting-edge technology?

42
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,479
Can you think of something?

43
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:24,020
So, for example, when we talk about mobile phones that can now connect to the internet, you can send emails, they have many features, even two cameras and touch-sensitive screens.

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,800
This is a type of cutting-edge technology.

45
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,699
Okay, it's the most new technology, the newest.

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,520
That's right.

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,740
So, after that, we heard another phrase.

48
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:33,659
This is a bit different.

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,759
This is more of a business phrase.

50
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,939
We have this retail price.

51
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:42,039
I bet the retail price will be too much.

52
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
So what is a retail price and how is it different from a regular price?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,259
Okay, so the retail price is basically the amount of money that you pay for something at the store.

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,240
Exactly.

55
00:03:52,439 --> 00:04:01,020
So, if I go to a store and I buy a computer for $1,000, I know that the store, they bought the computer for less money.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,080
Otherwise, they don't earn any money.

57
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,460
It's a bad business.

58
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,020
That's right.

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,960
So the retail price is higher than the actual price, the cost of production.

60
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,199
So retail price just basically means exactly what you said, Marco.

61
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,759
How much you would spend on something, how much something costs in a store.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,199
That's right.

63
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,259
That's why they're called retail stores.

64
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:21,060
Exactly.

65
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,819
Now, moving on, when we're discussing the X420, this computer, Mr.

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Ford says that it's aimed at the luxury market.

67
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,480
That means that this company would like to sell the computer in the luxury market.

68
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,379
The luxury market is not the normal market.

69
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:42,579
It's the market for very expensive, very beautiful, very nice things.

70
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,620
Luxury items, luxury brands are very, very expensive.

71
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,720
That's right.

72
00:04:47,860 --> 00:05:00,139
So for example, a car such as a Mercedes Benz might be aimed at the luxury market, whereas a car like a Honda Civic is aimed at maybe more of a middle-class market.

73
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:10,660
Or in clothing, you could say Gucci is a luxury brand, whereas the Gap or something is a regular consumer brand.

74
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,360
That's right.

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,759
So this is what we talk about when we refer to a luxury market.

76
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,339
Now, moving on to the description of the X420, Mr.

77
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,480
Ford says that it's amazing quality and that the workmanship is very, very good.

78
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,660
So workmanship is related to the word work, and now workmanship means how something is made.

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,980
Generally, when we talk about luxury goods, we expect the workmanship to be very, very high quality.

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,339
That means that the way that these things are made is the best.

81
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,040
That's right.

82
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,759
It's not going to break in one day.

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,980
Usually, I think when you talk about workmanship or luxury items like this, maybe part of it is made by hand.

84
00:05:52,980 --> 00:06:03,759
So this is what we talk about workmanship is how skilled that person is or how skilled his hands are to make this great piece of luxury good.

85
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:04,339
Exactly.

86
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:09,259
So a very good example in the world of music is the Stradivarius violin.

87
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:16,860
So Stradivarius violins are very, very expensive because the workmanship is the best quality in the history of world music.

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,500
That's right.

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,199
Very good.

90
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,399
So that's what we talk about workmanship.

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,319
You can apply it to many different things.

92
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:32,160
But moving on to our last word for language takeaway today, another nice business phrase that we talk about specifically in sales is market share.

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,019
Now Marco, describe to me market share because I know what a market is.

94
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,819
It's where things are bought and sold, but what is a share, market share?

95
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,180
So in this case, we're talking about computers.

96
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,920
So a market share is how much a company owns in the market or how much they sell in this market.

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:07:03,879
So for example, if we have a city of a thousand people and everyone there buys computers, if we sell computers to 500 people of that city, that means we own a 50 percent market share.

98
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:04,459
Okay.

99
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,660
So a market share is usually like a percentage, right?

100
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,339
It's a piece of this big pie.

101
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,040
That's right.

102
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,540
So everyone is always fighting for more market share.

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,819
Whoever sells more has bigger market share.

104
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:23,199
So in the world of televisions, would you say that Sony has a large market share in televisions?

105
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,699
Probably, although I think maybe Samsung has bigger market share or LG.

106
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,139
I don't know.

107
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:37,579
See, this is the thing with market shares is that there are so many brands in a certain industry that everyone has maybe a little piece of the pie or maybe one has a bigger piece.

108
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:38,160
I see.

109
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,060
All right.

110
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,339
Well, that's it for language takeaway.

111
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,980
I hope you guys have learned something there.

112
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:44,639
We're going to be back in a moment with Fluency Builder.

113
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,759
Now, of course, with all this cutting edge technology, there must be a catch, you might ask yourself.

114
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:00,620
I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might say.

115
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,100
Well, you'd be wrong.

116
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,540
Yes, of course, the X420 is aimed at the luxury market.

117
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,379
But if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the X420 represents incredible value for money.

118
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:18,379
At only 15,000 RMB, it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every leading brand and model.

119
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,860
So what differentiates us from our competitors?

120
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, if we compare Orange's luxury MP40 range, then we can really highlight some of the differences.

121
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,539
Now, of course, Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class products.

122
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,240
And I must admit, the MP40 is a breathtaking machine.

123
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,000
However, for most consumers, the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.

124
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:53,620
Compared with the X420, it is more expensive and there's no doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the X420, we really win hands down on value for money.

125
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Also, if you compare the after-sales service we offer, I think we can proudly boast the best customer service facilities in the whole laptop sector.

126
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:09,080
As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service, and we guarantee reliability.

127
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,240
The questions we must ask ourselves are, what does the Alpha brand stand for?

128
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,539
And also, how can we set ourselves apart from our competitors?

129
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:21,320
The answer to both of these questions is the same, my friends.

130
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,240
Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence, and for service.

131
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,860
If we always stick to this philosophy, then I'm confident that we will really be able to expand our market share significantly.

132
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:38,200
Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the X420.

133
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:49,840
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

134
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:58,000
So the first phrase I would like to look at in Fluency Builder is very important for consumers.

135
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,679
That means people who buy things are very interested in this thing.

136
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,080
We call it value for money.

137
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,159
That's right.

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,840
When Mr.

139
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:14,340
Ford was talking about the X420, he said it represents incredible value for money at only 15,000 RMB.

140
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:18,379
Okay, so 15,000 RMB sounds like a lot of money to me.

141
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,960
But he's saying that the value of the product is very good considering the price.

142
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,600
That's right.

143
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,039
And that's what the phrase value for money is.

144
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:35,259
As you said, the quality and how much you are getting for this product compared to how much you're paying for it is very, very good.

145
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,919
So the idea is it should be more expensive, but it's not.

146
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,399
So the value considering the price is actually very good.

147
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:50,419
So maybe I could say that this computer, this Apple computer, it's expensive.

148
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:56,419
It's $1,500, but the value for money is great because I'll have this computer for five years.

149
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:56,799
That's right.

150
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,080
Another computer might break and I have to buy a new one.

151
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,779
And also you can describe value for money as something good or bad.

152
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:07,500
For example, the same computer, you can say it doesn't represent good value for money.

153
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,659
So maybe you paid more than what you're actually getting.

154
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,879
There was a bad deal.

155
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,679
There was a bad deal.

156
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,159
That's right.

157
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,500
Great.

158
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,279
Well, the next phrase is an interesting one.

159
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,759
It's in this sentence where we talked about workmanship.

160
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,259
So Mr.

161
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:28,120
Forbes was describing the X420 and he said it really wins hands down on a value for money.

162
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,000
That's right.

163
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,059
So the phrase that we're going to take a look at is hands down.

164
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:37,159
So what does he mean when he says that workmanship for the X420 wins hands down?

165
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:41,460
So this is a very spoken English phrase and it has nothing to do with your hands.

166
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,879
It means, well, I guess it could hands down.

167
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,419
I'm not really sure what the literal meaning is.

168
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:51,559
But when we say it, we mean that something is without competition.

169
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,480
So there is no doubt in my mind.

170
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,100
This is absolutely the best in value for money.

171
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,019
And so maybe if I say, oh, well, there are two or three computers, they're all nice.

172
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,740
Nothing is hands down.

173
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,679
But if I say, listen, this IBM computer is hands down the best on the market.

174
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,799
That means there's no other competition.

175
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,860
It is the best.

176
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:16,299
So you can't really argue with that.

177
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,240
It's the best.

178
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,639
No arguments there.

179
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:19,399
No arguments.

180
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:19,820
Exactly.

181
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:20,679
Hands down.

182
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,659
He is hands down the best baseball player I've ever seen.

183
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,059
Okay.

184
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,700
Very good.

185
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:26,580
Okay.

186
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,659
So now moving on to our next phrase.

187
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,980
When Mr.

188
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:37,419
Ford again was talking about now the company, he said that the Alpha brand is what does it stand for?

189
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,419
And he said that it stands first and foremost for quality.

190
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:42,360
Okay.

191
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,779
So this means you think about first and foremost.

192
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,740
This means above everything else.

193
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,080
So Alpha means a lot of things.

194
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,340
They make good computers.

195
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,820
They're a strong company.

196
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,179
But first and foremost, it means quality.

197
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,720
It means that more important than any other thing that Alpha brand does, quality is the most important.

198
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:00,720
Okay.

199
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:05,879
So basically what we're seeing, the first thing and the most important thing is quality.

200
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,779
So that's what you mean when you say first and foremost.

201
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:16,080
So you can say, for example, when I'm looking for a car price is the first and foremost important quality.

202
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:16,620
Okay.

203
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:24,120
So we're talking about, you know, for Marco, the most important factor, the most important part of buying a car is the price.

204
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,379
That's right.

205
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,240
So moving on to our last phrase now, when Mr.

206
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:34,940
Ford was ending this part of his speech, he said that we always stick to this philosophy.

207
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,299
To stick to.

208
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,080
So stick is a verb and a noun.

209
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,940
If you're familiar with the noun, it's different from what we're talking about today.

210
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:46,620
To stick to, remember that as a phrase, to stick to something.

211
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,340
So to stick to means to continue doing it.

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,220
Okay.

213
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:56,820
You're going to hear this a lot when you talk about sports or even in the office, I could say, listen, Marco, I don't want you to quit.

214
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,259
I really want you to stick to this project.

215
00:13:59,639 --> 00:13:59,779
Okay.

216
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,320
So to continue doing to not give up.

217
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:03,039
Don't give up.

218
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:03,279
Right.

219
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,960
So you could say this to a child also, you know, I know you want to quit playing soccer, but I think you should stick to it.

220
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,179
To stick to it.

221
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,559
That means to continue playing, not to quit.

222
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,220
Okay.

223
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:15,779
Very good.

224
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:22,960
So it's a very nice and maybe spoken English phrase, which means continue doing, to not give up, to be persuasive.

225
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:23,539
Right.

226
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:24,779
To stick to something.

227
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,179
I want to stick to it.

228
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,639
You should stick to this.

229
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,159
Okay.

230
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,840
Very good.

231
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,759
So a lot of phrases here.

232
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,039
I think we've taken a look at a lot of things here.

233
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:34,460
Maybe we should go back.

234
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,799
Let's review one last time the dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

235
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,799
Okay.

236
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,440
Okay.

237
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,159
The questions we must ask ourselves are, what does the Alpha brand stand for?

238
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,480
And also, how can we set ourselves apart from our competitors?

239
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,220
The answer to both of these questions is the same, my friends.

240
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:20,159
Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence, and for service.

241
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,799
If we always stick to this philosophy, then I'm confident that we will really be able to expand our market share significantly.

242
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:27,860
Okay.

243
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:27,960
All right.

244
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,059
Let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the X420.

245
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,600
All right.

246
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,919
So that's all the time we have for today on this series.

247
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,019
Be sure to check out the next part next week, where we're going to continue talking about presentations.

248
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,799
And as you can see, it's very business-oriented, but you can apply everything that you learned to other situations as well.

249
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,620
Exactly.

250
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,940
These phrases like hands down and to stick to.

251
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,159
These aren't business phrases.

252
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,200
These are words you can use in business, but I use these in my everyday life.

253
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:08,859
And I think that with a little bit of practice, you guys can sound really, really fluent in English.

254
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:11,299
And these phrases are a good place to start.

255
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:11,980
That's right.

256
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:17,980
