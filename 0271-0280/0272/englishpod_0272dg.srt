EnglishPod.com Hey Mal, are you up for some tennis today?

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:10,820
Sorry, I can't.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:18,379
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,519
Mmm, you sound exhausted.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,500
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,160
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,199
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

8
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:32,659
Oh, I don't know.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,520
It's hard to find the right nanny.

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,759
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.

11
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,060
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,240
I think you should definitely consider it.

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:51,439
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

14
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,679
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,820
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,979
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

17
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:03,600
Oh, that's great.

18
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:04,519
Thanks, Grace.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,519
Can you give me her number?

20
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,719
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

21
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,980
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.
