EnglishPod.com Hey Mal, are you up for some tennis today?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sorry, I can't.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Mmm, you sound exhausted.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, I don't know.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's hard to find the right nanny.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think you should definitely consider it.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, that's great.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thanks, Grace.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can you give me her number?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.
