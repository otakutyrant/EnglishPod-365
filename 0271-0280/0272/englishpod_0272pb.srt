00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an intermediate level lesson all about a very special kind of person who helps you out with your kids.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we want to get a nanny, a nanny.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A nanny.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So a nanny is a person, usually a woman, but it can be a man as well, I guess.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And this person takes care of your children when you're working or when you're out of the house.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So this is what's going on today.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We're going to see what type of responsibilities a nanny has.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And so let's listen to her dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hey, Mal, are you up for some tennis today?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sorry, I can't.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You sound exhausted.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, I don't know.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's hard to find the right nanny.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I think you should definitely consider it.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh, that's great.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Thanks, Grace.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you give me her number?

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So now let's take a look at some key words on language takeaway.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So as you said, Marco, we don't just find a nanny.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We hire a nanny.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So what does the word hire mean?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so we have the verb to hire someone, and that means to get someone to work for you, and you pay them, obviously, money in exchange for their services.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, so this is different from finding a job for someone, because I could find a job for someone, but maybe that job is at a restaurant, but when I hire someone, that means I want that person to work for me or for my company.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So in this case, obviously, we are not a company.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We are just a couple of people who are looking for a nanny, so we need to hire a nanny.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We need to get her to work for us, and obviously, you will pay her a salary.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
All right, so when you pay her a salary, you also have some expectations about what the nanny will do.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So one of those expectations is that the nanny will take the children to their after-school activities.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's right.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So this is a phrase, if you will, or a type of thing that happens after school.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So usually children, when they finish their classes, they have some things that they can do at school, like, for example, sports.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So this is very common in America, but not so common in other parts of the world.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So just to explain, if your child is in high school or middle school, after school is over, there's no more class, your child might want to play soccer or to go to art class.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And these are things that you do at the school, but it's usually considered an activity, not a class.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And so we call these after-school activities.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So these activities are usually for recreation.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They're not really part of the curriculum.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's not a class.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, you don't get marks or grades for these.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
These are just for fun, you know.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
A lot of people work, and so they need to have these activities for their kids to stay at school until they finish working.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so we want the nanny to take the children or pick them up from their after-school activities.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And we also need the nanny to help out with some household chores.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, so you should know where these chores are being done.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The first word is household, which means in the house.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, so examples of household chores would be like cleaning the windows.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Washing the dishes.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Or doing laundry.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So basically any type of cleaning around the house.

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Making the house look nicer.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And so usually children have chores.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
These are things they need to do.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But a nanny can also help with household chores.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And also we want the nanny to help and run some errands.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, so this is funny.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This phrasal verb, this phrase uses the word to run, but we're not running like, you know, a sport.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're going to do some errands.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But the verb here is to run errands.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So you know, Marco, on Sunday I have to run some errands.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sorry I can't go out to the movie with you guys.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, so to run errands, what does that mean?

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, an errand is like a job or a task that you have to do, but it's usually not something you get paid for.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
To run an errand is like to go to the grocery store and pick up food or, you know, to pick up your clothes at the laundromat, you know, you have dry cleaning.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so they're kind of like chores, I guess, but you don't really do them in the house.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You have to go outside and run these errands.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You have to go pay your bills, for example.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Exactly.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And so, you know, when I was growing up, on the weekends my mother would always run all of her errands because during the week she had to work.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, very good.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So a lot of interesting words there.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think we can go ahead and listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh, I don't know.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's hard to find the right nanny.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think you should definitely consider it.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, that's great.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thanks, Grace.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Can you give me her number?

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
All right, we're back with Fluency Builder, and so let's take a look at some of these phrases now.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So this first phrase is a very kind of spoken English phrase, something that you're going to hear all the time, especially if you're talking to your American friends.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We say, are you up for some tennis today?

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
To be up for.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, so to be up for something.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This is from the very first sentence when Grace says, hey Mel, are you up for some tennis today?

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What does it mean if I ask someone if they are up for some tennis?

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This means, would you like to play tennis today?

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you interested in playing tennis today?

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So is this a good idea for you?

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you want to do this?

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So basically, are you willing to play tennis today?

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
All right, so to be up for is to be interested in or willing to do something.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you up for a movie tonight?

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, or maybe you can ask your friend, are you up for grabbing a bite to eat later on?

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Absolutely, I'm hungry.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So to be up for is a good way to ask a question.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
After that, though, we have another phrase.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This phrase is very important when you're trying to get someone to help you.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So how do we ask, can you help me?

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In the dialogue, we saw how Mel said that it would be a great idea to get a nanny because she would love to have someone to help me out.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So to help someone out, to help me out.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So this is interesting because you could say, I need someone to help me.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it's more common to hear the phrase to help me out.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So you're not going out, you're not, it doesn't have to do with space.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But we just say this phrase to help out means to help someone.

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So it's basically the exact same thing, but it just sounds a lot more natural.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So, you know, Marco, I'm moving tomorrow.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you have some time to help me out?

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, so you say help me out.

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But you could also say, do you have time to help me?

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And both are okay.

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Or if I'm talking about me and my friend, you know, we're really busy tomorrow.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you have any time to help us out?

143
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, so we just changed the person that we went to the plural form.

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yes, me, us, you.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, very good.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay, and so for our last phrase, this is actually also very interesting when Grace was telling Mel that she's really busy and if she gets a nanny, she wouldn't have to juggle such a busy schedule.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
All right, so the key verb here is to juggle.

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Now, I wish I could show this to you guys, but as this is an audio podcast, I can't.

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What is the verb to juggle mean, Marco?

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, I don't know if you've ever seen clowns or at a circus where people have three balls and they throw them in the air with two hands and they're basically throwing stuff in the air, sometimes balls or pins and stuff like that.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Sometimes fire.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Fire.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So that's to juggle, basically to have many things in your hands and be able to move them at the same time.

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
All right, so when you're talking about a busy schedule, this means that you have lots and lots of things to do.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's important to be able to juggle your busy schedule.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That means to handle doing many things at the same time.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

158
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
All right, so another way to say this is because you're so busy right now, having a nanny will help you complete your tasks or finish what you need to do.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So you can also say the CEO of the company has to juggle a very busy schedule.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All right, he has many, many things to do in general.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's right.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay, so a lot of stuff.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hey, Mal, are you up for some tennis today?

166
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Sorry, I can't.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You sound exhausted.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

170
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, I don't know.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's hard to find the right nanny.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her and how she interacts with the kids.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I would love to have someone to help me out though.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think you should definitely consider it.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She's very responsible, a good cook and great with kids.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, that's great.

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Thanks, Grace.

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Can you give me her number?

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So there are a lot of people all over the world who have nannies.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I often see them when I go to New York City.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You know, women who take out the kids and they push them in strollers and mom and dad maybe go to work or have classes or something.

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's right.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Now, this is interesting because there's also another word called a babysitter, but it's different, right?

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There's a difference between a nanny and a babysitter.

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They both take care of kids, but I think it's the time that they do it.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's a difference.

194
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's right.

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So a nanny is usually hired on like a contract basis.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You say, I need a nanny to come and watch my kids every day, Monday to Friday for the next six months.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But with a babysitter, you say, Hey, my husband and I, we want to go to watch a movie on Friday.

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Can you come for two hours?

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay.

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All right.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So a nanny is long term.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's someone who maybe lives with you.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Someone who does some work at your house.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Someone who cleans the dishes and watches the kids.

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But a babysitter just comes, you know, once a month or just when you need her.

206
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

207
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So that's the main difference between a nanny and a babysitter.

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Now, as you said, they're very, very common nowadays because I guess it's not like before when women usually would stay at home and take care of the children.

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now both parents usually work and so more people are getting nannies.

211
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's right.

212
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Although nannies can be very expensive, it depends where you live.

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And so for people who can't afford a nanny, you know, if a nanny is too expensive, the child, the baby will go to daycare.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And that's actually like a place where many babies or children are together.

215
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And there's, you know, one teacher or one or one nanny who takes care of everyone.

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's right.

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So it's an interesting topic.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Maybe some of our listeners grew up with a nanny or have a nanny or had a nanny when they were growing up.

219
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Or maybe you have kids of your own and you have a nanny now.

220
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yeah.

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let us know.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
