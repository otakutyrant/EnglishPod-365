00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:14,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an intermediate level lesson all about a very special kind of person who helps you out with your kids.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:14,699
That's right.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,660
Today we want to get a nanny, a nanny.

6
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:18,420
A nanny.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,120
So a nanny is a person, usually a woman, but it can be a man as well, I guess.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,420
And this person takes care of your children when you're working or when you're out of the house.

9
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,140
That's right.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,940
So this is what's going on today.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,859
We're going to see what type of responsibilities a nanny has.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,179
And so let's listen to her dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,299
Hey, Mal, are you up for some tennis today?

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,259
Sorry, I can't.

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:54,780
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,920
You sound exhausted.

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,899
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

18
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,420
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities.

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,579
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

20
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,079
Oh, I don't know.

21
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,920
It's hard to find the right nanny.

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,200
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,459
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.

24
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,719
I think you should definitely consider it.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,840
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

26
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:31,079
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,219
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,420
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

29
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,019
Oh, that's great.

30
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:40,939
Thanks, Grace.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,939
Can you give me her number?

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,140
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,400
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.

34
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,319
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,719
So now let's take a look at some key words on language takeaway.

36
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,140
So as you said, Marco, we don't just find a nanny.

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,719
We hire a nanny.

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,560
So what does the word hire mean?

39
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:18,020
Okay, so we have the verb to hire someone, and that means to get someone to work for you, and you pay them, obviously, money in exchange for their services.

40
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:30,680
Okay, so this is different from finding a job for someone, because I could find a job for someone, but maybe that job is at a restaurant, but when I hire someone, that means I want that person to work for me or for my company.

41
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,300
That's right.

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,840
So in this case, obviously, we are not a company.

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,960
We are just a couple of people who are looking for a nanny, so we need to hire a nanny.

44
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,580
We need to get her to work for us, and obviously, you will pay her a salary.

45
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:49,060
All right, so when you pay her a salary, you also have some expectations about what the nanny will do.

46
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,919
So one of those expectations is that the nanny will take the children to their after-school activities.

47
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,860
That's right.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,840
So this is a phrase, if you will, or a type of thing that happens after school.

49
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:09,419
So usually children, when they finish their classes, they have some things that they can do at school, like, for example, sports.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,219
That's right.

51
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:14,120
So this is very common in America, but not so common in other parts of the world.

52
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:24,879
So just to explain, if your child is in high school or middle school, after school is over, there's no more class, your child might want to play soccer or to go to art class.

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,219
And these are things that you do at the school, but it's usually considered an activity, not a class.

54
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,479
And so we call these after-school activities.

55
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:33,960
That's right.

56
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,580
So these activities are usually for recreation.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,759
They're not really part of the curriculum.

58
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,259
It's not a class.

59
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,560
No, you don't get marks or grades for these.

60
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,759
These are just for fun, you know.

61
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:52,759
A lot of people work, and so they need to have these activities for their kids to stay at school until they finish working.

62
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,539
That's right.

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,419
Okay, so we want the nanny to take the children or pick them up from their after-school activities.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,259
And we also need the nanny to help out with some household chores.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,439
Okay, so you should know where these chores are being done.

66
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,520
The first word is household, which means in the house.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,279
Okay, so examples of household chores would be like cleaning the windows.

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Washing the dishes.

69
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,399
Or doing laundry.

70
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:25,639
So basically any type of cleaning around the house.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,199
That's right.

72
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,519
Making the house look nicer.

73
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,959
And so usually children have chores.

74
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,800
These are things they need to do.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,759
But a nanny can also help with household chores.

76
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,319
Okay.

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,740
And also we want the nanny to help and run some errands.

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,079
Okay, so this is funny.

79
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:47,980
This phrasal verb, this phrase uses the word to run, but we're not running like, you know, a sport.

80
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,139
We're going to do some errands.

81
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,240
But the verb here is to run errands.

82
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,220
So you know, Marco, on Sunday I have to run some errands.

83
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,459
I'm sorry I can't go out to the movie with you guys.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Okay, so to run errands, what does that mean?

85
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,879
Well, an errand is like a job or a task that you have to do, but it's usually not something you get paid for.

86
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:16,120
To run an errand is like to go to the grocery store and pick up food or, you know, to pick up your clothes at the laundromat, you know, you have dry cleaning.

87
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,699
Okay, so they're kind of like chores, I guess, but you don't really do them in the house.

88
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:24,000
You have to go outside and run these errands.

89
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,800
You have to go pay your bills, for example.

90
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:26,439
Exactly.

91
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,019
And so, you know, when I was growing up, on the weekends my mother would always run all of her errands because during the week she had to work.

92
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,360
Okay, very good.

93
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,160
So a lot of interesting words there.

94
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,699
I think we can go ahead and listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

95
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:14,220
Oh, I don't know.

96
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,100
It's hard to find the right nanny.

97
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,339
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids.

98
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,639
I would love to have someone to help me out, though.

99
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,839
I think you should definitely consider it.

100
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,019
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

101
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,240
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,379
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

103
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,560
She's very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.

104
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,180
Oh, that's great.

105
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,100
Thanks, Grace.

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,100
Can you give me her number?

107
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,319
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,540
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day, and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.

109
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:03,319
All right, we're back with Fluency Builder, and so let's take a look at some of these phrases now.

110
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:14,839
So this first phrase is a very kind of spoken English phrase, something that you're going to hear all the time, especially if you're talking to your American friends.

111
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,139
We say, are you up for some tennis today?

112
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,259
To be up for.

113
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,160
Okay, so to be up for something.

114
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,360
This is from the very first sentence when Grace says, hey Mel, are you up for some tennis today?

115
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,180
What does it mean if I ask someone if they are up for some tennis?

116
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,639
This means, would you like to play tennis today?

117
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,779
Are you interested in playing tennis today?

118
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,639
So is this a good idea for you?

119
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,560
Do you want to do this?

120
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,279
So basically, are you willing to play tennis today?

121
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,920
All right, so to be up for is to be interested in or willing to do something.

122
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,899
Are you up for a movie tonight?

123
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,199
Okay, or maybe you can ask your friend, are you up for grabbing a bite to eat later on?

124
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,079
Absolutely, I'm hungry.

125
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,959
So to be up for is a good way to ask a question.

126
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,339
After that, though, we have another phrase.

127
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:03,180
This phrase is very important when you're trying to get someone to help you.

128
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,899
So how do we ask, can you help me?

129
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:12,740
In the dialogue, we saw how Mel said that it would be a great idea to get a nanny because she would love to have someone to help me out.

130
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,379
So to help someone out, to help me out.

131
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,180
So this is interesting because you could say, I need someone to help me.

132
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,920
But it's more common to hear the phrase to help me out.

133
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,180
So you're not going out, you're not, it doesn't have to do with space.

134
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,860
But we just say this phrase to help out means to help someone.

135
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,799
So it's basically the exact same thing, but it just sounds a lot more natural.

136
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,879
So, you know, Marco, I'm moving tomorrow.

137
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,720
Do you have some time to help me out?

138
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,559
Okay, so you say help me out.

139
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,080
But you could also say, do you have time to help me?

140
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:46,620
And both are okay.

141
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,440
Or if I'm talking about me and my friend, you know, we're really busy tomorrow.

142
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,559
Do you have any time to help us out?

143
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:55,820
Okay, so we just changed the person that we went to the plural form.

144
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,539
Yes, me, us, you.

145
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,860
Okay, very good.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:14,519
Okay, and so for our last phrase, this is actually also very interesting when Grace was telling Mel that she's really busy and if she gets a nanny, she wouldn't have to juggle such a busy schedule.

147
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:18,000
All right, so the key verb here is to juggle.

148
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,720
Now, I wish I could show this to you guys, but as this is an audio podcast, I can't.

149
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,700
What is the verb to juggle mean, Marco?

150
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:37,580
Well, I don't know if you've ever seen clowns or at a circus where people have three balls and they throw them in the air with two hands and they're basically throwing stuff in the air, sometimes balls or pins and stuff like that.

151
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,259
Sometimes fire.

152
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:38,860
Fire.

153
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,899
So that's to juggle, basically to have many things in your hands and be able to move them at the same time.

154
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,159
All right, so when you're talking about a busy schedule, this means that you have lots and lots of things to do.

155
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,100
It's important to be able to juggle your busy schedule.

156
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,940
That means to handle doing many things at the same time.

157
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,720
That's right.

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:09,840
All right, so another way to say this is because you're so busy right now, having a nanny will help you complete your tasks or finish what you need to do.

159
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,620
That's right.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,519
So you can also say the CEO of the company has to juggle a very busy schedule.

161
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,340
All right, he has many, many things to do in general.

162
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,039
That's right.

163
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,139
Okay, so a lot of stuff.

164
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,519
I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

165
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,200
Hey, Mal, are you up for some tennis today?

166
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,159
Sorry, I can't.

167
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,679
I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.

168
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:47,840
You sound exhausted.

169
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,799
Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out.

170
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:54,340
She can pick the kids up and take them to their after school activities.

171
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,480
She can also help you do some household chores and run some errands.

172
00:10:59,340 --> 00:10:59,960
Oh, I don't know.

173
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,820
It's hard to find the right nanny.

174
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,100
You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her and how she interacts with the kids.

175
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,360
I would love to have someone to help me out though.

176
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:12,600
I think you should definitely consider it.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,779
This way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings.

178
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,980
I can refer you to this great nanny, Amy.

179
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,120
She used to work for my neighbors before they moved away.

180
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,299
She's very responsible, a good cook and great with kids.

181
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh, that's great.

182
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,840
Thanks, Grace.

183
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,840
Can you give me her number?

184
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,059
I'll talk it over with Julie and give her a call tomorrow.

185
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:40,299
Maybe this way I won't be so tired every day and Julie and I might even get to go on a date once in a while.

186
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,240
So there are a lot of people all over the world who have nannies.

187
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:51,480
I often see them when I go to New York City.

188
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,840
You know, women who take out the kids and they push them in strollers and mom and dad maybe go to work or have classes or something.

189
00:11:59,259 --> 00:11:59,460
That's right.

190
00:11:59,539 --> 00:12:04,299
Now, this is interesting because there's also another word called a babysitter, but it's different, right?

191
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,200
There's a difference between a nanny and a babysitter.

192
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,340
They both take care of kids, but I think it's the time that they do it.

193
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,139
That's a difference.

194
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:12,860
That's right.

195
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,419
So a nanny is usually hired on like a contract basis.

196
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:23,320
You say, I need a nanny to come and watch my kids every day, Monday to Friday for the next six months.

197
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,559
But with a babysitter, you say, Hey, my husband and I, we want to go to watch a movie on Friday.

198
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,860
Can you come for two hours?

199
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,500
Okay.

200
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:30,860
All right.

201
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,919
So a nanny is long term.

202
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
It's someone who maybe lives with you.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,120
Someone who does some work at your house.

204
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,779
Someone who cleans the dishes and watches the kids.

205
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,779
But a babysitter just comes, you know, once a month or just when you need her.

206
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:46,399
That's right.

207
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,740
Okay.

208
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,100
So that's the main difference between a nanny and a babysitter.

209
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:59,679
Now, as you said, they're very, very common nowadays because I guess it's not like before when women usually would stay at home and take care of the children.

210
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,299
Now both parents usually work and so more people are getting nannies.

211
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:04,980
That's right.

212
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,620
Although nannies can be very expensive, it depends where you live.

213
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:14,399
And so for people who can't afford a nanny, you know, if a nanny is too expensive, the child, the baby will go to daycare.

214
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,320
And that's actually like a place where many babies or children are together.

215
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,779
And there's, you know, one teacher or one or one nanny who takes care of everyone.

216
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:24,580
That's right.

217
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,940
So it's an interesting topic.

218
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,120
Maybe some of our listeners grew up with a nanny or have a nanny or had a nanny when they were growing up.

219
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,899
Or maybe you have kids of your own and you have a nanny now.

220
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:34,279
Yeah.

221
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,860
Let us know.

222
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:36,840
