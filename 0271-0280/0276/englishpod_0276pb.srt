00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,259
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,480
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary-level lesson for you.

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,119
That's right.

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,080
Today we're going to take a look at our mobile phones, but not the physical phone.

6
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,559
Now we're going to talk about services that you can get for your mobile phone.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,640
All right, so in America and many other places, you don't buy that little card with money on it.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,980
You actually have to pay every month for a service.

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,780
So we're going to learn about this today.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,359
Let's check out our dialogue.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,259
Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,640
Yes, I'd like to activate my voicemail service, please.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,679
Certainly, sir.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,939
We currently have a special promotion where we include voicemail services, call waiting, and also three-way calling.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,460
Sure, that sounds great.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,799
Are there any other fees?

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,640
Not at all.

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,479
No hidden fees or surcharges.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,100
It is a flat monthly rate.

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:55,820
Perfect.

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,439
I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.

22
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,620
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,700
Yes, of course.

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,980
We can activate all these services in about an hour.

25
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,640
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of these services on Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,700
Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:27,120
So, Marco, the first word that I wanted to talk about today is this verb, to activate.

28
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:36,379
That's right, we have a verb here, to activate, and this means to make something start to work, to make something begin.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,260
That's right, so to turn on, but you don't say, hey, can you activate the light?

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,219
Right, right, right.

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,780
You wouldn't say that.

32
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,060
You'd say, can you turn on the light?

33
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,180
But to activate means to start a service.

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:47,799
That's right.

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,599
So this is what we want today.

36
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,939
We want to activate some services, and the first one that we asked for is voicemail service.

37
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,640
Voicemail service.

38
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,379
Now let's think about the words that make up this one word.

39
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:01,799
Voicemail.

40
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,719
Voicemail.

41
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,040
So it's like a mailbox for your phone.

42
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:12,120
That's right, where you leave messages, obviously not text messages, but you leave voice messages.

43
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:12,919
That's right.

44
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,520
So, you know, I'm sorry, I cannot answer the phone right now, please leave a message after the beep.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,360
Beep.

46
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,919
That's my voicemail message.

47
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,460
That's right.

48
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:27,840
So it's actually a very useful thing, we'll talk about that a little bit later, but let's take a look at our next service.

49
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,680
We also want to get call waiting.

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,919
Alright, so this is a very interesting service.

51
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:48,919
I don't know if they have this in other parts of the world, but in America, if I'm talking on the phone to you, Marco, and we're having a nice conversation, but then my mom calls, when I'm talking, I hear beep, beep, beep, I hear some sounds, and that means someone else is trying to call you.

52
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,379
That's right.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Alright, so you can't hear this, but I can hear this, and that means if I want to talk to my mom, I'll say, hey Marco, listen, someone else is calling, can I call you tomorrow?

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,259
That's right, so actually call waiting is a very useful service because the person that's calling you will never get a busy signal.

55
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,780
You'll always seem available.

56
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:11,939
But the good thing is that you can switch between calls.

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:25,460
So I could say, hey Marco, listen, I think that's my mom, can you hold, can you wait, I will be right back, and then I push a button, and then I can talk to my mom, and then my mom says, okay, I'll talk to you later, I push a button, and then Marco, you're there.

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,860
That's right, that's right.

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,659
Very useful service as well.

60
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,620
Now let's take a look at our next service that we are also getting as part of this package.

61
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,620
We are getting three-way calling.

62
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,879
So from the name of this, we can think of three people talking, alright?

63
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,099
So maybe Marco, you want to talk to my mom too.

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,680
That's right.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,539
So we can talk and then we add another person.

66
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:53,699
So you can call a third phone number, 123-ME-U and someone else, and the three of us can talk at the same time.

67
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,819
That's right, so it's kind of a way of having a small conference between three people.

68
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,300
That's right.

69
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:05,979
And so this is what you can do with three-way calling, you can call two people simultaneously and talk to them at the same time.

70
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,800
So a lot of great services here, I think we've learned a couple of different things.

71
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,439
Why don't we review it and listen to the dialogue again.

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,139
Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

73
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes, I'd like to activate my voicemail service please.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
Certainly sir.

75
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:30,839
We currently have a special promotion where we include voicemail services, call waiting and also three-way calling.

76
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,360
Sure, that sounds great.

77
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,660
Are there any other fees?

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,560
Not at all.

79
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,000
No hidden fees or surcharges, it is a flat monthly rate.

80
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:38,699
Perfect.

81
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,360
I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,540
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

83
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,579
Yes, of course.

84
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,800
We can activate all these services in about an hour.

85
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,160
All right, we're back.

86
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,879
So now let's keep on going here towards the last half of our dialogue.

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's take a look at some more words on Language Takeaway, Part 2.

88
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,300
Language Takeaway.

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,079
So this first phrase in Language Takeaway, Part 2 is hidden fees.

90
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:13,759
That's right.

91
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,399
Hidden fees.

92
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,079
What are these?

93
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:18,060
The operator guarantees that there are no hidden fees.

94
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,180
So this is usually what we call the fine print, the small fees that we don't really know about.

95
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,240
So they say, oh, it costs $3 a month, but you have small little hidden fees.

96
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:35,379
Like if you're late on a payment, they'll charge you an extra dollar or if you use the service too much, they'll charge you another extra dollar.

97
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:35,980
Right.

98
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,040
So a fee is something that you pay.

99
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:38,980
All right.

100
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,980
And something that is hidden means you cannot see it.

101
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:50,019
And so like you're saying with this example, there are many, many conditions, many, many different things, rules that we have to follow.

102
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:57,199
And if we don't follow those rules exactly, then maybe this company that provides the phone service will ask us for more and more money.

103
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:57,939
That's right.

104
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,720
And actually it has to do a lot with our next word where she said that there are also no surcharges.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,459
Okay.

106
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,259
So a surcharge is an extra amount of money that you have to pay.

107
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,379
So we say that this service has no hidden fees or surcharges.

108
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,439
So that means that we don't have to pay anything additional to what we are already paying.

109
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,319
For example, some companies will say, okay, pay us $10 and you get your new cell phone phone plan.

110
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,660
But to activate your service is another $5.

111
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,699
So the total price is $15.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,279
And that's a surcharge.

113
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,379
That's an extra fee that you have to pay.

114
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,040
That's right.

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:36,779
Okay.

116
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,779
And continuing on the topic of money, she says it is a flat monthly rate, a flat monthly rate.

117
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,120
Well, monthly is an adverb that tells us how often we pay.

118
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,680
We pay one time every month.

119
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,339
But this term flat rate is very, very important.

120
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,560
And it happened, we use this term a lot when we're talking about paying fees.

121
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,279
So a flat rate means it does not change when you, for example, talk more on the phone.

122
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:02,720
That's right.

123
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,439
So you pay the same amount every month.

124
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,000
That's right.

125
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,740
A clear example is probably your internet service provider.

126
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,420
You pay $20 a month and that's a flat rate.

127
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,980
If you use the internet 24 hours a day, nothing happens.

128
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:16,660
You don't pay more.

129
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,000
If you use it less, you still pay the same amount of money.

130
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,680
So what if I pay $10 normally, but this month I use the internet a lot and now I have to pay $15.

131
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:25,759
Is that a flat rate?

132
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,060
No.

133
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,399
No, that's not a flat rate.

134
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:27,740
Okay.

135
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,160
That changes with my use.

136
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,540
Okay.

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,680
And now let's take a look at one last service that this man was also interested in getting.

139
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,259
And he says that he wants to get a call forwarding service.

140
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,879
He wants to forward his calls to a local number.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,060
Okay.

142
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,040
So to forward something means to pass it along.

143
00:07:50,360 --> 00:08:04,399
So call forwarding means that if I'm not available, for example, I'm not at home and someone calls my home, there's no one there to talk to the person that's calling, then maybe I could have a call forwarding service that will make the call go to my cellular phone.

144
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:05,339
All right.

145
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,680
So the call forwarding means that the call will travel to another phone.

146
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:09,240
That's right.

147
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:09,800
That's right.

148
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:15,160
So as you said, this is what call forwarding is and the word to forward, as you said, to pass along.

149
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:25,560
Maybe many of you have done it in your emails when you get maybe a nice message, you forward it to more of your friends and this is the exact same definition.

150
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,060
Exactly.

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,259
So you have one message and you pass it on to someone else.

152
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:34,899
And so in call forwarding, you normally have this service if you're often on business trips or traveling, you're out of town.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,340
That's right.

154
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:39,179
It's very, very helpful for people who are not in one place all the time.

155
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,720
That's right.

156
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,539
So why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

157
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,200
Telco Mobile, how can I help you?

158
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:51,960
Yes.

159
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,580
I'd like to activate my voicemail service, please.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,639
Certainly, sir.

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,899
We currently have a special promotion where we include voicemail services, call waiting and also three-way calling.

162
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:02,639
Sure.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,440
That sounds great.

164
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,720
Are there any other fees?

165
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:05,620
Not at all.

166
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,440
No hidden fees or surcharges.

167
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,039
It is a flat monthly rate.

168
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,759
Perfect.

169
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:13,379
I also wanted to know if there's any call forwarding service.

170
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,559
I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.

171
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,620
Yes, of course.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,759
We can activate all these services in about an hour.

173
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:37,399
So talking about all these services, it's very interesting because many of these services are not really available everywhere in the world, like, for example, voicemail.

174
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,259
That's right.

175
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,340
So in China, no one really has voicemail.

176
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,639
It's very strange for an American because you think, well, if I'm not home, I want to know why this person called.

177
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,340
But oftentimes, you just have to call back and find out.

178
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,960
That's right.

179
00:09:50,960 --> 00:10:02,759
And actually, I really think that voicemail service is a very good thing, especially if you need to leave a message for someone, you know, hey, we're at the restaurant, call me back when you have a chance.

180
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,139
But also call waiting.

181
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:10,360
I really, really hate to call someone and have the busy, you know, the busy tone.

182
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,399
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

183
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,379
And then you know that they're on the telephone, but you don't know when they will stop talking on the phone.

184
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,539
This really annoys me, too, especially when I call for delivery food from a restaurant.

185
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,820
It's like, please answer your phone.

186
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,539
Maybe someone's ordering a lot of food.

187
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,200
That's right.

188
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,980
So actually, these services are very common in the United States.

189
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,039
And I'm sure there are even more services now.

190
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:41,259
I know that you can have a telephone number, for example, in another country, but it'll ring in the United States.

191
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,220
Yeah, that's right.

192
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,539
Or you can connect your computer and your messaging service and all these things to your phone.

193
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,879
So it's pretty technologically advanced.

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,220
But I'm very curious to know about you guys, our listeners.

195
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,139
What kind of services for your cell phone or for your landline do you have?

196
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,759
Do you have call forwarding or voicemail?

197
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,620
Let us know.

198
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,559
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

199
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:02,899
All right.

200
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,600
We'll see everyone there.

201
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,000
Bye.
