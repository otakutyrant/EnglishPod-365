00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we've got another episode in our series about giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we're going to talk about some key elements of the topic that we're talking about.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're talking about a laptop computer, so we're going to give some more details and characteristics about the computer and what makes it so special.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's take a listen to what Mr.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ford has to say about what makes this company's computers very special.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models, and also, of course, with some of our competitors?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is a key question and is something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light laptop computers.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
All right, we're back.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, we obviously heard a lot of vocab here, a lot of interesting things regarding the computer.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why don't we take a look at some of the words that he used on Language Takeaway.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So the first word that is pretty challenging is to differentiate, it's a verb.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So Mr.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Ford says, ask yourself what it is that differentiates this new computer line with other ones.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right, so to differentiate, that means what makes it different, what is so special about it, right?

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right, so you can ask a question like this.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What differentiates Apple computers from other computers?

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's right, so you're asking what makes it so different.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, so then he rephrases the question and he says, well, in other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the other computers?

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
All right, so this is a verbal phrase, to stand out, and it's very similar to the one that we just mentioned, to differentiate.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This means what makes this computer special?

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why is it unique?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we're basically saying why is this one more noticeable than the rest?

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's to stand out.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So maybe if everyone in the office is wearing white t-shirts today but somebody comes in wearing a red t-shirt, that person is going to stand out.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Actually, Marco, I think today that's you.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're wearing a red t-shirt today, so you stand out.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, so now as he continued to talk about the computer, he used this prefix before an adjective that was very interesting.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He said this computer is ultralight, and then he said it's ultra-thin as well, and that it has an ultra-fast processor.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, so ultra-light, ultra-fast, ultra-thin.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is a way of saying very, very.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So that's what he's saying.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's saying it's very light, it's very thin.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So that's pretty much the structure.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can add ultra before an adjective to emphasize that it's very something.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So when I think of cool actors, I think of James Dean.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He was ultra-cool.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ultra-cool.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He was very cool.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so you can do it with pretty much all adjectives, but you know, you can't really exaggerate and use it all the time.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, the key is to remember this is an exaggeration, so yeah, you don't want to use it all the time.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But if you want to make sure you say that something is, if you want to emphasize that something is special, or that it's very, very something, you use the word ultra.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:00,000
As he continued to talk about the characteristics of the laptop computer, he made reference to the LCD display, the screen of the computer, and he said that it's a crystal clear 15-inch LCD display.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What does he mean by crystal clear?

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, crystal is a very special kind of glass, right?

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And so it's expensive, it's what some people have as their special glassware, you know, wine glasses and drinking glasses, and so crystal is very special because it's so clear to see through.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So transparent.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's transparent.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Light goes through it, you can see everything.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so to say something is crystal clear is to say that it's very, very clear.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's extremely clear.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's as clear as crystal.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So basically the screen of this computer, you can see very, very well everything that's on the screen.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Everything that's happening.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All the colors, all of the words.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then moving away from the characteristics of the computer, he talked about projected sales and he expected 20 million dollars, but he said that that is a very conservative estimate.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, so an estimate is like a guess.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's how much we think we will earn in a year or how much we think will happen.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But in this case, a conservative estimate means that it's a low estimate.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know, we might make 20 million dollars next year.

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's conservative.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Another estimate is we will make 40 million dollars, so that's not conservative.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's right.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, so as you said, an estimate is we are more or less guessing how much it would be.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So what would be the opposite of a conservative estimate?

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You could say a generous estimate.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That means you're giving a lot.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So a generous estimate is our revenues will be at around 60 million dollars next year.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay, very good.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So I think we've taken in a lot, why don't we take a break.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Now, a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And also, of course, with some of our competitors.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is a key question and is something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra light laptop computers.

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra fast processor.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The X420 really stands out as next generation laptop.

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least 20 million dollars.

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

113
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

115
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right, we're back with Fluency Builder.

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's take a look at some key phrases now.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Fluency Builder.

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
All right, so our first phrase is a very important phrase when you're trying to differentiate different products or things.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We say, this is really a cut above the rest.

122
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, so if something is a cut above the rest, it means that it's in a different category from everyone else.

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's a lot better.

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It is a lot better.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So you can say that we saw many, many applicants who wanted to come for a job at our company, but John, he was a cut above the rest.

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He was much better than all of the other candidates.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, very good.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So a cut above the rest.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now when we talked about this computer, he also made reference saying that, you know, it's in a league of its own.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The computer is so powerful, it's so new, it's so fantastic that it's in a league of its own.

131
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, so a league is like a category in this case.

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We have good computers and we have great computers, but this computer is so good.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's in an entirely new category.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's awesome.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's amazing.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's mind-blowing.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So we often say this with new things, you know.

138
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is great, but nothing before it can compare.

139
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They're just not as good.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So it's in a league of its own.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, very good.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So you can make reference to products or also people, right?

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
A person can be in a league of his own.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, you know, there are a lot of good singers in the world, but this singer, he is in a league of his own.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, very good.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And to finish off Fluency Builder, towards the end of his dialogue, he said, to please bear in mind that this is only the first year of production.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, so we're talking about making these products, you know, there's, there's, there's going to, it's going to take time to make money and Mr.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Ford would like us to bear something in mind, to bear in mind this fact.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So to bear something in mind means to remember or to consider.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay, so he's asking us to please consider that it's only the first year of production, so we can't really expect too much.

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's right.

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So you could say this about a number of different things.

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I could say, you know, Marco, here's, here's my report.

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Please look over it.

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please bear in mind.

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is only a first draft.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Okay.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So I will make some edits.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I will make some changes.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's not perfect.

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And I know that.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So please bear this in mind.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you're kind of warning me.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're kind of letting me know to consider the fact that it's not the final report and there might be some mistakes.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Exactly.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So to bear in mind that this saying this is kind of like a warning that things are not perfect yet, but, you know, I still want your opinion, right?

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Very good.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models and also, of course, with some of our competitors.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is a key question and it's something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light laptop computers.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

181
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We're back.

191
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Now you've probably saw this acronym in the very first part of the dialogue when he said that the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

192
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:24,000
All right, so this is a very special acronym for the business world, and it stands for U unique, S selling, and P point, unique selling point.

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right.

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So as the name says, a unique selling point are characteristics that are unique to the machine that allow it to be more competitive and to persuade people to buy it or to sell itself.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
All right, so the new iPhone has a very interesting unique selling point.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back.

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So that really differentiates it from other phones on the market.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's right.

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So that is what a USP is, or a unique selling point.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
As we said, it's an acronym in the business world, but next time that you find the opportunity to use it, I'm sure it's going to sound amazing.

201
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes, very professional, USP, unique selling point.

202
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right, so that's all the time we have.

203
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
