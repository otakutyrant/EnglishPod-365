00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:03,439
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,179
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,660
My name is Catherine, and today we've got another episode in our series about giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:10,419
That's right.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,599
Today we're going to talk about some key elements of the topic that we're talking about.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:22,679
We're talking about a laptop computer, so we're going to give some more details and characteristics about the computer and what makes it so special.

7
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,780
So let's take a listen to what Mr.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,879
Ford has to say about what makes this company's computers very special.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:44,119
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models, and also, of course, with some of our competitors?

10
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,299
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

11
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,579
This is a key question and is something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

12
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,159
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,900
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light laptop computers.

14
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:10,439
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

15
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,120
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,540
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,719
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,140
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,340
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

20
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:41,819
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

21
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,120
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,719
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

23
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,680
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,280
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

25
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,280
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,460
All right, we're back.

27
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,099
So, we obviously heard a lot of vocab here, a lot of interesting things regarding the computer.

28
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,939
Why don't we take a look at some of the words that he used on Language Takeaway.

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,659
So the first word that is pretty challenging is to differentiate, it's a verb.

30
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,180
So Mr.

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,500
Ford says, ask yourself what it is that differentiates this new computer line with other ones.

32
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,080
That's right, so to differentiate, that means what makes it different, what is so special about it, right?

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,939
That's right, so you can ask a question like this.

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,319
What differentiates Apple computers from other computers?

35
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,960
That's right, so you're asking what makes it so different.

36
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,659
That's right.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,280
Okay, so then he rephrases the question and he says, well, in other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the other computers?

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,039
All right, so this is a verbal phrase, to stand out, and it's very similar to the one that we just mentioned, to differentiate.

39
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,800
This means what makes this computer special?

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Why is it unique?

41
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,099
That's right.

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,800
So we're basically saying why is this one more noticeable than the rest?

43
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,199
That's to stand out.

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:37,599
So maybe if everyone in the office is wearing white t-shirts today but somebody comes in wearing a red t-shirt, that person is going to stand out.

45
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,360
Actually, Marco, I think today that's you.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,960
You're wearing a red t-shirt today, so you stand out.

47
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:50,379
Okay, so now as he continued to talk about the computer, he used this prefix before an adjective that was very interesting.

48
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:58,900
He said this computer is ultralight, and then he said it's ultra-thin as well, and that it has an ultra-fast processor.

49
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,900
Okay, so ultra-light, ultra-fast, ultra-thin.

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,819
This is a way of saying very, very.

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,719
That's right.

52
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,099
So that's what he's saying.

53
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,719
He's saying it's very light, it's very thin.

54
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,319
So that's pretty much the structure.

55
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,480
You can add ultra before an adjective to emphasize that it's very something.

56
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,060
That's right.

57
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,740
So when I think of cool actors, I think of James Dean.

58
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,160
He was ultra-cool.

59
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:23,839
Ultra-cool.

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:24,839
He was very cool.

61
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:25,920
That's right.

62
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:33,779
Okay, so you can do it with pretty much all adjectives, but you know, you can't really exaggerate and use it all the time.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,459
Well, the key is to remember this is an exaggeration, so yeah, you don't want to use it all the time.

64
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:46,459
But if you want to make sure you say that something is, if you want to emphasize that something is special, or that it's very, very something, you use the word ultra.

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,120
That's right.

66
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:47,480
Okay.

67
00:04:48,079 --> 00:05:00,480
As he continued to talk about the characteristics of the laptop computer, he made reference to the LCD display, the screen of the computer, and he said that it's a crystal clear 15-inch LCD display.

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,379
What does he mean by crystal clear?

69
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,620
Well, crystal is a very special kind of glass, right?

70
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:18,100
And so it's expensive, it's what some people have as their special glassware, you know, wine glasses and drinking glasses, and so crystal is very special because it's so clear to see through.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,839
So transparent.

72
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,519
It's transparent.

73
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,259
Light goes through it, you can see everything.

74
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,139
And so to say something is crystal clear is to say that it's very, very clear.

75
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,699
It's extremely clear.

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,439
It's as clear as crystal.

77
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,199
Okay.

78
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:36,180
So basically the screen of this computer, you can see very, very well everything that's on the screen.

79
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:36,920
Everything that's happening.

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,899
All the colors, all of the words.

81
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,879
Okay.

82
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:52,480
And then moving away from the characteristics of the computer, he talked about projected sales and he expected 20 million dollars, but he said that that is a very conservative estimate.

83
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,939
Okay, so an estimate is like a guess.

84
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,420
It's how much we think we will earn in a year or how much we think will happen.

85
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:04,579
But in this case, a conservative estimate means that it's a low estimate.

86
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,680
You know, we might make 20 million dollars next year.

87
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,800
That's conservative.

88
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,620
Another estimate is we will make 40 million dollars, so that's not conservative.

89
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:14,339
That's right.

90
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:20,540
Okay, so as you said, an estimate is we are more or less guessing how much it would be.

91
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,800
So what would be the opposite of a conservative estimate?

92
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,860
You could say a generous estimate.

93
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,560
That means you're giving a lot.

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,240
Okay.

95
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:35,379
So a generous estimate is our revenues will be at around 60 million dollars next year.

96
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,519
Okay, very good.

97
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,439
So I think we've taken in a lot, why don't we take a break.

98
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,240
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

99
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,860
Now, a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models?

100
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,639
And also, of course, with some of our competitors.

101
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,860
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

102
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,100
This is a key question and is something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

103
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,680
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,439
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra light laptop computers.

105
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,019
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

106
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,660
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

107
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:33,079
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra fast processor.

108
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,220
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

109
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,720
The X420 really stands out as next generation laptop.

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,860
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

111
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:56,779
Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least 20 million dollars.

112
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,660
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

113
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,259
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

114
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,240
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

115
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,819
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

116
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,819
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,779
All right, we're back with Fluency Builder.

118
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,080
Let's take a look at some key phrases now.

119
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:35,980
Fluency Builder.

120
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:43,759
All right, so our first phrase is a very important phrase when you're trying to differentiate different products or things.

121
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,580
We say, this is really a cut above the rest.

122
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:55,500
Okay, so if something is a cut above the rest, it means that it's in a different category from everyone else.

123
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,299
It's a lot better.

124
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,460
It is a lot better.

125
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:06,639
So you can say that we saw many, many applicants who wanted to come for a job at our company, but John, he was a cut above the rest.

126
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,419
He was much better than all of the other candidates.

127
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:10,919
Okay, very good.

128
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,000
So a cut above the rest.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,620
Now when we talked about this computer, he also made reference saying that, you know, it's in a league of its own.

130
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,139
The computer is so powerful, it's so new, it's so fantastic that it's in a league of its own.

131
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,159
Okay, so a league is like a category in this case.

132
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,919
We have good computers and we have great computers, but this computer is so good.

133
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,379
It's in an entirely new category.

134
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,340
It's awesome.

135
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,480
It's amazing.

136
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:38,480
It's mind-blowing.

137
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,120
So we often say this with new things, you know.

138
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,340
This is great, but nothing before it can compare.

139
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,360
They're just not as good.

140
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,320
So it's in a league of its own.

141
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,440
Okay, very good.

142
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,259
So you can make reference to products or also people, right?

143
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,080
A person can be in a league of his own.

144
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:54,899
That's right.

145
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,419
So, you know, there are a lot of good singers in the world, but this singer, he is in a league of his own.

146
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,779
Okay, very good.

147
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:12,340
And to finish off Fluency Builder, towards the end of his dialogue, he said, to please bear in mind that this is only the first year of production.

148
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:21,299
Okay, so we're talking about making these products, you know, there's, there's, there's going to, it's going to take time to make money and Mr.

149
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,460
Ford would like us to bear something in mind, to bear in mind this fact.

150
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,639
So to bear something in mind means to remember or to consider.

151
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:37,179
Okay, so he's asking us to please consider that it's only the first year of production, so we can't really expect too much.

152
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:37,980
That's right.

153
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,940
So you could say this about a number of different things.

154
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,200
I could say, you know, Marco, here's, here's my report.

155
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,620
Please look over it.

156
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,620
Please bear in mind.

157
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,379
This is only a first draft.

158
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:47,820
Okay.

159
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,159
Okay.

160
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,440
So I will make some edits.

161
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:50,480
I will make some changes.

162
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,259
It's not perfect.

163
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:51,940
And I know that.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,919
So please bear this in mind.

165
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:54,460
Okay.

166
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,679
So you're kind of warning me.

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,759
You're kind of letting me know to consider the fact that it's not the final report and there might be some mistakes.

168
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,379
Exactly.

169
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:09,580
So to bear in mind that this saying this is kind of like a warning that things are not perfect yet, but, you know, I still want your opinion, right?

170
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,759
Okay.

171
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:10,460
Very good.

172
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,919
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

173
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:29,080
Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models and also, of course, with some of our competitors.

174
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,259
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

175
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,500
This is a key question and it's something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

176
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,080
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

177
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:50,820
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light laptop computers.

178
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,360
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

179
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,059
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

180
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,460
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

181
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:09,620
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

182
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:14,059
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,279
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

184
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:26,759
Now if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

185
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,059
Now this is really a conservative estimate.

186
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,659
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

187
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,620
Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

188
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:47,220
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

189
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,200
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.

190
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,500
We're back.

191
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:13,620
Now you've probably saw this acronym in the very first part of the dialogue when he said that the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

192
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:24,940
All right, so this is a very special acronym for the business world, and it stands for U unique, S selling, and P point, unique selling point.

193
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,820
That's right.

194
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:39,039
So as the name says, a unique selling point are characteristics that are unique to the machine that allow it to be more competitive and to persuade people to buy it or to sell itself.

195
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:44,100
All right, so the new iPhone has a very interesting unique selling point.

196
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:46,799
It has two cameras, one on the front and one on the back.

197
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,159
So that really differentiates it from other phones on the market.

198
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,080
That's right.

199
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,759
So that is what a USP is, or a unique selling point.

200
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:02,399
As we said, it's an acronym in the business world, but next time that you find the opportunity to use it, I'm sure it's going to sound amazing.

201
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,600
Yes, very professional, USP, unique selling point.

202
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,519
All right, so that's all the time we have.

203
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,059
