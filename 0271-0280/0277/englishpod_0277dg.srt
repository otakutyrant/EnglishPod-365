EnglishPod.com Now, a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new X420 line with our previous models?

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,960
And also, of course, with some of our competitors.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,140
In other words, what makes the X420 stand out from all the others?

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,399
This is a key question and is something I'd like to explore in a little depth.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,000
Firstly, the X420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,740
The first thing to mention is that the X420 is the first in a new generation of ultra-light laptop computers.

7
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:42,280
It is only two pounds, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors.

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,979
In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine, it's very powerful.

9
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:50,380
Four gigabytes of RAM with an ultra-fast processor.

10
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,560
The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal clear 15 inch LCD display.

11
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,979
The X420 really stands out as a next generation laptop.

12
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,180
Compared with our previous X540 range, it really is in a league of its own.

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,659
Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the X420, we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least $20 million.

14
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,959
Now, this is really a conservative estimate.

15
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:22,560
If our marketing campaign is successful, I'm confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,540
Now, please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,120
I'm certain that in the coming three years, the X420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue.

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,159
Okay, now let's move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.
