EnglishPod.com Hi there.

2
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,980
I am looking for a new car.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,519
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:15,519
I see.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,219
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:24,620
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,300
Perfect.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,660
I like this one.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,660
That is the Ford Focus.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,000
A very light but powerful vehicle.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,119
It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows.

12
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:40,719
Tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

13
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,399
Sounds like a good car.

14
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:44,320
How many miles to the gallon?

15
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,320
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,880
That is really convenient.

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,659
Especially now the fuel prices are so high.

18
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,280
What's under the hood?

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,960
A very powerful 2.5 liter turbocharged engine.

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,060
Trust me, this car is fast.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,420
Now for the most difficult question.

22
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,019
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,760
Very affordable ma'am.

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,459
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the first year.

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,920
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

26
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:19,579
Great.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,799
Let's do it.
