EnglishPod.com Hi there.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I am looking for a new car.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I see.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Perfect.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I like this one.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That is the Ford Focus.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
A very light but powerful vehicle.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sounds like a good car.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
How many miles to the gallon?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That is really convenient.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Especially now the fuel prices are so high.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's under the hood?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A very powerful 2.5 liter turbocharged engine.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Trust me, this car is fast.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now for the most difficult question.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Very affordable ma'am.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the first year.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Great.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's do it.
