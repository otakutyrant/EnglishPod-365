00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we've got an intermediate-level lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now, Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to try to buy a new car.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we're going to the car dealer, and we want to try and see if we can get a new car.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so lots of great vocabulary for buying that car.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's check out today's dialogue.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll be back in a moment.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hi there.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am looking for a new car.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I see.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Perfect.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I like this one.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That is the Ford Focus, a very light but powerful vehicle.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It comes with dual-side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows, and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sounds like a good car.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How many miles to the gallon?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It is a very fuel-efficient vehicle, giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That is really convenient, especially now that fuel prices are so high.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's under the hood?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Trust me, this car is fast.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Now for the most difficult question.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Very affordable, ma'am.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the first year.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Great.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's do it.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So now we're going to take a look at some of that vocab, especially the one that the salesman used on Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Language Takeaway.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All right, so at the beginning of this dialogue, we hear a lot of features that this car has.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The first one is trade-in, actually.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is something that the man says when he goes to the car lot.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He says he has an old car.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He has a Ford Pinto and he wants to trade it in.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He wants to trade in his old car.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this is something that you do in America or other places when you have a car already but you want a new car.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And so the car lot, the place where you can buy the cars, they'll usually give you some money for your old car and you can spend that money on your new car.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So basically you give them your old car plus some extra cash and then you can get a new car.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So that's basically what a trade-in is.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And well, as you said, we had a lot of features on this car of the Ford Focus.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
First of all, dual-side airbags.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, so dual-side is pretty simple.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It means that you have them on both sides, the left and the right.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dual means two.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But airbags are what's important in this phrase.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Airbags do what exactly, Marco?

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They protect you from hitting the front part of the car.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So maybe out of the steering wheel, a bag will inflate if you crash.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So it will prevent you from hitting the steering wheel and getting hurt.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's like a big balloon and it protects you from damaging your body.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's right.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it has two airbags for the passenger and for the driver.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So after that, we also heard about a number of things that are power.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Power steering, power windows.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So what does power steering do?

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Power steering, or also called assisted steering, it allows you to turn your car with less effort.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So maybe you've driven a car that didn't have power steering, and so you really have to struggle when you're turning the car, especially if you're parking.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So you have to turn the wheel and turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it to turn.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But power steering makes it more automatic, so it's very easy to turn left or right.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's right.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And the same thing goes for power windows.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So maybe your car doesn't have electric windows.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So you have to do it manually with a little lever.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a turn it around and around and around.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But instead with power windows, you just push a button and the window goes down or up.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And actually as well, another feature for the windows, we have tinted windows.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now these are sometimes very popular.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't think I've ever had tinted windows on my car, but tint means something is darker.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's protected from the sun.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So tinted sunglasses, for example, can be very dark.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But tinted windows on a car are black.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They don't let much sunlight in, so you don't get blinded by the sun or so other people can't see you from outside.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Usually limousines, you will see all limousines have tinted windows.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Politicians like to drive around in cars with tinted windows.

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, so a lot of features there, a lot of vocab regarding the car.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why don't we take a break?

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk some more.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hi there.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I am looking for a new car.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are in luck this month because all of our 2010 models are on sale.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Perfect.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I like this one.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That is the Ford Focus, a very light but powerful vehicle.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It comes with dual-side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Sounds like a good car.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How many miles to the gallon?

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It is a very fuel-efficient vehicle, giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That is really convenient, especially now that fuel prices are so high.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's under the hood?

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Trust me, this car is fast.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Now for the most difficult question.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Very affordable, ma'am.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the first year.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Great.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's do it.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All right, we're back.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So now let's start again with language takeaway.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now let's take a look at part two.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Language takeaway.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All right, so a very, very key phrase that we heard in the dialogue is automatic or sometimes manual transmission.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So automatic transmission, manual transmission.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That is very important when we talk about cars.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's right.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So basically the car has a lot of gears and with an automatic transmission, the car will basically change gears by itself.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So you start in park and you go to drive and you can go to reverse, park, drive, reverse.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This controls kind of the way the car moves.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But with a manual transmission, this means you have to do it by yourself using your hand.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So we have what gears?

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We have one, two, three, four, and sometimes five.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So that's a manual transmission.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You have to change the gears manually.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a lot of work.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Now talking about another feature of the car, the client asked, well, how many miles to the gallon does the car get?

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And the salesman said that the car is very fuel efficient.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay, so this is a very important phrase right now as gas is very expensive in some parts of the world and we're concerned about the environment, right?

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So a fuel efficient car is a car that uses gas very well.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That means that I can go very, very far on one tank of gas.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't need to keep putting gas into my car.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So usually, for example, sports cars are not fuel efficient.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hummers are not fuel efficient.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So fuel efficient is a key thing to look for these days.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But the customer also wanted to know what's under the hood.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So this phrase under the hood is very, very common when we're talking about cars.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The person said, what's under the hood?

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And basically what we're saying is what is under the hood, which is that metal cover on the front part of the car.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So you lift that in there, you can have access to the engine.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So basically that's the question.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What kind of an engine does this car have?

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oftentimes when your car stops or you have a problem, like it's broken, someone like a mechanic will say, hey, let's have a look, let's look under the hood.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He wants to know, let's look at the engine so we can find the problem.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But in this case, it's not a problem.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He just wants to know what kind of a car is this?

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Is it powerful or is it not so powerful?

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's right.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's exactly right.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So that's why we want to know what's under the hood.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And well, he goes on to explain all the features about the engine.

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But then when we talk about the payment, how much the car costs, the salesman said, you know what?

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not expensive.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And on top of that, you can drive it out today with zero percent down payment.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is important.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Down payments are payments that you often make with very, very big ticket items.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
A house, a car, things like this.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So a down payment is what you have to pay to get the thing to begin using it.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But not all of the payment.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So it's a percentage.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So if the car is ten thousand dollars and the man says there's a zero percent down payment, how much do I have to pay?

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Mark Zero.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Zero.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't pay anything today.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I pay in a month a little bit.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And then next month, a little bit.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But if the payment is a ten percent down payment, then I have to pay one thousand dollars today.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's right.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's right.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So as you said, it's usually about things that have a big price tag that are very expensive.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
A house, a car, these types of things, usually you need to give a down payment.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That means that you're committing to buying it.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So a lot of interesting things going on in today's lesson.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And we'll be back to talk some more.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Hi there.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I am looking for a new car.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I see.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You are in luck this month because all of our two thousand ten models are on sale.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It is a perfect time to buy a new car since it's the end of the year.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Perfect.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I like this one.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That is the Ford Focus, a very light but powerful vehicle.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.

198
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Sounds like a good car.

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How many miles to the gallon?

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It is a very fuel efficient vehicle, giving you about thirty four miles in the city and forty on the highway.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That is really convenient, especially now that fuel prices are so high.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What's under the hood?

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A very powerful two point five liter turbocharged engine.

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Trust me, this car is fast.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now for the most difficult question.

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Very affordable, ma'am.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can take it out of this lot today with zero down payment and no interest for the first year.

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Great.

211
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's do it.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Alright, so buying a new car can always be tricky.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What do you prefer, though, for example, in these types of features of the car?

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For me, a car must be very fuel efficient because, number one, all cars are all bad for the environment.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So I want a car that's less bad for the environment.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But also, I really like manual transmission because number one, manual transmission is more fuel efficient than automatic.

217
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And also, I like to have more control when I'm driving.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I feel safer in a manual transition car because, you know, when you do manual, you actually pay more attention to your driving.

219
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have to concentrate.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But automatic, you can think about other things and listen to the music and touch.

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I think that that's a safety issue.

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But what do you look for?

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know you're really, really into cars.

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, I actually preferred manual transmissions as well.

225
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Most importantly, because of the way that the car drives, especially a sports car.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's definitely something for me.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's nice to have a manual transmission, but also, you know, little nice features like in the exterior, like the rims.

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I like nice rims or maybe a nice paint job.

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tinted windows.

230
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm not a very big fan of tinted windows, but yeah, I don't know.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Some cars nowadays, even for, as you said, politicians, they even sell them bulletproof.

232
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's right.

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They have bulletproof glass.

234
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Very, very secure.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, for me, I don't think I need bulletproof glass, but a good stereo is a good start.

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's right.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You want to have good speakers and...

238
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can connect your iPod to the stereo now.

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Exactly, exactly.

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So a lot of great things with cars, and actually the model that they mentioned, the Ford Pinto, is a very popular but very bad car.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It was cheap.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It was cheap, but it wasn't very good.

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
In the 1970s and 80s, this was a very common car, and it's famous for being a small, cheap car.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's right, that's right.

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Like the Volkswagen Beetle.

246
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes, exactly.

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So maybe you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and you can tell us if you have a car.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What was your first car?

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And did you buy a new car or a used car?

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's right, secondhand cars.

251
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So let us know, and of course, if you have any questions, we're always there on the website, EnglishPod.com, and we'll see you guys there.

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Bye.
