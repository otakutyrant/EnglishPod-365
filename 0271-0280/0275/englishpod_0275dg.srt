00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:15,259
EnglishPod.com I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven't finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,480
What are you getting?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,660
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,739
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

5
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:26,039
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,519
I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.

7
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,739
Yeah, I know.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,479
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,759
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,140
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher, and trash compactor.

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,520
That's a good idea.

12
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,560
The kitchen will look amazing.
