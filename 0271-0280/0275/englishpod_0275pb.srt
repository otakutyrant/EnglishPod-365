00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson about things that you buy for your kitchen.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we are going to buy a lot of machines and devices for our kitchen.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So let's jump into the dialogue.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's see what we are buying, and we'll be back in a bit.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour, and I still haven't finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What are you getting?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I lent the old one to my brother, and he broke it.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, I know.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher, and trash compactor.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a good idea.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The kitchen will look amazing.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of those strange machines on language takeaway.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Language takeaway.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, so the kinds of machines you buy for your kitchen are called kitchen appliances.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, so the word appliance in appliance is basically a machine or device that is used for the home, right?

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right, so there are many different kinds of appliances.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can usually plug these in.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They usually need electricity to work, but the ones we're talking about today are special.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They're for the kitchen, so that's why we call them kitchen appliances.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's right.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, very good.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So the kitchen appliances that we are looking at or we're trying to buy is, well, the first one we have is a blender.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
A blender.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So a blender is a kitchen appliance that you use normally to make drinks.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So this is a glass jar that's usually on the top of a little machine, and when you put in, for example, some ice and some tea and some lemonade, and you can mix it up, and you have this special mixed drink, so it's called a blender.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So as you mentioned, it's usually used to make some sort of juice or drink, but we also are getting a juicer, which is specifically to make juices.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now what is the difference between a blender and a juicer?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well a blender is a machine that turns the things inside it around, so it mixes them together, but a juicer is different because a juicer will actually take the juice from the fruit.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So for example, if I have an orange and I cut the orange in half, I put that half on the juicer and it turns around so that the juice will come down, because otherwise I have to use my hands to squeeze it, and that takes time.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is an electronic appliance that helps me get the juice from my fruits.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right, okay.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So we have a juicer to make juice, a blender to make different drinks, and now to make coffee we have a very simple machine, a coffee maker.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, so a coffee maker is just a simple machine that you put water and coffee into and it will make the coffee for you.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Usually it's called a drip coffee maker because the coffee drips down, but there are many different kinds of coffee makers.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, now this next appliance can be a little bit confusing because now this one is called a mixer.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So what is the difference between a blender, a juicer, and now we have a mixer?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well there are different kinds of mixers actually, but usually the kind of mixer that we are referring to, that we're talking about, is one that is electronic and it looks like it has these two funny spoons on the end, and when you turn the mixer on, you put it into a bowl and you mix the things in the bowl.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So for example, if I want to make pancakes, I put some flour and some water and some eggs into a bowl, and I could stir it with my hand, with my spoon, but it's very tiring.

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So here's a mixer that's electronic to turn those ingredients around on its own.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right, so it's quicker and obviously you don't get as tired.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Very good.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So I think we should take a break.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go back to our dialogue, let's check out some more appliances, and we'll be back to talk about the rest of them.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven't finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What are you getting?

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, I know.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher, and trash compactor.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's a good idea.

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The kitchen will look amazing.

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at more kitchen appliances on Language Takeaway Part 2.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Language Takeaway.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well this first item, this first appliance, is something that I know a lot of people all over the world are familiar with.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's called a rice cooker.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now a rice cooker, as the name says, it is used to cook rice, but it does it in a very simple and automatic way.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's right, so you put the rice and the water in the rice cooker and you turn it on to, what, 20 minutes, and then later, 20 minutes later, it's already cooked.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's done.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Done.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Easy.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Right, it's actually very convenient and very simple to make.

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And now, along with a rice cooker, sometimes we also get a steamer.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, so a steamer is something that we normally use with vegetables, or in Asia, a lot of times we use it with dumplings, these little foods that are stuffed, and so a steamer is something that you use to cook a food, but with the steam from hot water.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's right.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't put the food in the water.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You don't fry the food, but you use the steam, that hot air, to cook the food inside.

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's right.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So it's actually considered to be one of the healthiest ways of cooking food because it's not as oily.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's right.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, so now an interesting appliance that is actually not very popular in any other place except, I think, North America, is a trash compactor.

84
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, so trash means garbage.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's the things that you want to throw away that you won't use anymore, and a compactor is something that actually takes the trash, and it makes it very small.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, compact means small, and so a trash compactor is like a special garbage bin.

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You put your garbage in it, and you close it, and you say compact, and then it makes a loud noise, and then when you pull it out, you open it up, the trash is very, very small.

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So it's very easy to throw away.

89
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So as we said, I've never actually seen this appliance in any other country except the United States and Canada.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't think I have either, but it's pretty popular in American homes because it helps save space, and it's very easy to throw things away that way.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, that's right.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I guess you can make a little bundle of trash, and it's much easier than throwing a big bag of trash away.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay, and well, we're doing all this because we are kind of refurnishing the kitchen.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We are giving it new furniture.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right, so we want to change the appearance, and to do this, we will refurnish.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So to furnish something means to put furniture in it to make it look nice.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
To refurnish means to change the furniture because we already have some, but we don't like it.

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so you can do this with your whole house.

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right.

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So maybe you throw away the old couch and the table and the kitchen cabinets, and you put a new one so you are refurnishing your home, refurnishing the kitchen.

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's right, to refurnish.

103
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay, so a lot of great vocab here.

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think this is very useful for the kitchen, especially if sometimes you don't really know what appliance you need to buy or what the instructions of a recipe say.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour, and I still haven't finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need.

107
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you getting?

108
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender.

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't forget to also get a new mixer.

111
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I lent the old one to my brother, and he broke it.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, I know.

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I am also getting a rice cooker and a steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher, and trash compactor.

116
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's a good idea.

117
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The kitchen will look amazing.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right, we're back.

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Now, another appliance that I think is also not very popular in other countries, apart from the trash compactor, we saw in the dialogue a dishwasher.

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A dishwasher, that's right.

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So this is something that you find in many American homes.

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So why do you think trash compactors and dishwashers are not so popular in other places?

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not sure.

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's possible.

125
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, it's because they're not very energy efficient.

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not really sure.

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I never had a trash compactor in my home in America, but we always had a dishwasher, and this was very, very nice to have because you don't have to wash the dishes by yourself.

128
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You put them in the machine, and the machine washes them.

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you have to do some work before you put the dishes in the dishwasher, right?

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You have to put them in the sink in water for a while, and then you take them out, and then you put it in the dishwasher, right?

131
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Now, what we usually did is if there was food on a plate, we take the food and we put it in the trash, and if it's, you know, sometimes you leave the plate for like a day or two and it's very hard, then you have to put some water on it because otherwise it will be hard and it will never come off.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But if it's recently used, you put all of the plates, all of the cups, all of the knives and forks into the dishwasher, and it uses hot water and some soap, and it will wash those dishes in about 30 minutes.

133
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So how well does it wash?

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It washes very, very well.

135
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Some work better than others, but of course, if you have food that's two days old on a plate, then it won't wash very well.

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I think it also has to do with the type of instruments that people use around the world to cook.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
For example, big pots.

138
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't think you can put pots in the dishwasher, right?

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No, you can't.

140
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You could not put a wok in the dishwasher, but I think it also has to do with the fact that dishwashers are very big, and if you have a small apartment or, like me, a very small kitchen, it's impossible to make room for a dishwasher.

141
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But it seems like a very convenient thing, and of course, there are so many other kitchen appliances that, well, if we started to mention all of them, we would run out of time.

142
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But if you have any questions or any comments about this lesson or you have maybe some other kitchen appliances, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave those there.

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We hope to see you at EnglishPod, and until next time, bye.
