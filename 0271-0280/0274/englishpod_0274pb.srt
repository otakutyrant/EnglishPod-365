00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,700
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:12,060
My name is Katherine, and today we have part two of a very important and very valuable series about giving presentations.

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,439
As you well know, we started this series.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:24,519
It's a ten-part series, and today we're going to talk about sales and charts and graphs and more or less explaining maybe a PowerPoint presentation.

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,420
That's right.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,379
So you're going to learn some wonderful ways of talking about changes in markets and marketing.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,140
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what you've heard.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,020
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,640
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

12
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,299
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,159
Well, the answer is simple.

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,620
There is a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for profit.

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,459
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,060
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5 percent of the total world population.

17
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,000
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:34,400
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4 to 5 percent, an increase of 1,000 percent compared with the 1980s.

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:48,000
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,719
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.

21
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:58,400
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,099
For us at Alfa, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,419
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

24
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,460
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

25
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,120
All right, we're back, so now let's start with Language Takeaway.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Okay, so in the first part of what Mr.

27
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,259
Ford is saying, he mentions something called market share.

28
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,120
Now, Margo, what is market share?

29
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:46,699
That's right, everyone is competing for market share, and this is basically a small portion of your available market.

30
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:57,439
So, for example, if you sell perfumes, women's perfume, then your market share is maybe women who are 18 to 35 years old in your city or in your town or in your country.

31
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,080
I see.

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:08,020
Right, so when we're talking about market share, because we're sharing a piece of this big pie, we're going to talk about that in terms of a percentage, so 30% or 15%.

33
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:08,620
That's right.

34
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:17,259
I think maybe one of the clearest examples is Coca-Cola has I think maybe a 60% market share of the carbonated beverages market.

35
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,800
Interesting, so you could say that Apple has a 50% market share of the personal computing industry.

36
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,520
That's right.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,360
Very good, so this is what we refer to as market share.

38
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:38,500
Now, as we continue to talk about markets, we have two very interesting words when we refer to a developed market and a developing market.

39
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,719
Okay, so a developed market is something that has been polished and grown over time.

40
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:58,219
Perhaps we talk about the developed world being Western Europe and America, but then we have developing markets, and those are markets that are still trying to figure out kind of what's going on.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,219
They're growing.

42
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
They're usually growing much faster than a developed market.

43
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,460
That's right.

44
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:10,419
So again, when we're talking about maybe computers, we consider, for example, the United States a developed market.

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:23,899
Many people already have a computer or express the desire to buy one, and so maybe a developing market are some of the African countries where they're still growing, and so now they're beginning to purchase more and more computers.

46
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,300
Okay, so developed and developing, two different ways to describe markets.

47
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:29,939
That's right.

48
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,379
Now, after that, we hear this phrase, cutthroat.

49
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,480
So someone asks, why is this market so cutthroat?

50
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,199
What does this mean?

51
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,980
A cutthroat business or a cutthroat industry.

52
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,439
It means that it's very, very competitive.

53
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,240
Okay, so cutthroat, we're actually talking about maybe having a knife and cutting someone else's throat, but it's just a metaphor.

54
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,040
It's a way of saying, yes, this is very competitive, so you're not actually cutting someone's throat.

55
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,579
Everyone is fighting for that market share, so it's very cutthroat.

56
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:05,240
Everyone is fighting very, very hard, but you're not literally killing someone or cutting their throats.

57
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,040
And you could even use this to talk about a sporting event.

58
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,800
You could say, you know, it was a cutthroat game.

59
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,240
That's right, that's right.

60
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,839
So anything that's very competitive or very close.

61
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:18,860
So to finish off language takeaway, when Mr.

62
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:26,740
Ford was, towards the end of his presentation, he said that the rewards could be very, very big in a very short timeframe.

63
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,959
So when we say the word timeframe, we mean period of time.

64
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:33,180
It's not like, you know, 2 p.m.

65
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,680
It's like from May to June, we have this short timeframe.

66
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,079
It's only two months long, so timeframe is a window or a period.

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,360
That's right, so this is what he is referring to, is that in a very short period or in this period of time, they could make a lot of money, a timeframe.

68
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,500
Right, but how long would a long timeframe be?

69
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,639
Maybe a couple of years.

70
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,740
All right, so you can have a short timeframe and a long timeframe.

71
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,439
That's right.

72
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,379
Okay, why don't we take a look at our dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.

73
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,240
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

74
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:22,860
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

75
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,579
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

76
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,399
Well, the answer is simple.

77
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,860
There is a huge untapped potential market out there, with a huge untapped potential for profit.

78
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:40,699
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

79
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:47,319
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population.

80
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:51,259
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

81
00:06:51,759 --> 00:07:02,680
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4-5%, an increase of 1,000% compared with the 1980s.

82
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:16,259
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.

83
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,980
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.

84
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,660
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

85
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:34,360
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

86
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:39,680
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

87
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,720
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

88
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,920
All right, we're back.

89
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,620
So now we've picked out a couple of different phrases for you.

90
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,720
Let's check those out now on Fluency Builder.

91
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,480
So in today's dialogue, we heard Mr.

92
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
Ford talk about some numbers.

93
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,100
He's talking about growth and change in the market.

94
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,300
And he says, with figures to around four to five percent, we've got an overall increase of one thousand percent.

95
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,160
That's right.

96
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:28,660
So this phrase, an increase of, very, very common when you're talking about growth of maybe revenue or when you're talking about the growth of a company or sales, for example.

97
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,000
So it's important to remember here that this is a fixed phrase.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,659
We say an increase of 10 percent or an increase of 30 percent.

99
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,100
But you can use the same phrase with drops in percentages or money.

100
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,899
So you can say a decrease of 10 percent.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,919
That means that you go down 10 percent or a decrease of 100 percent.

102
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,620
That's right.

103
00:08:52,100 --> 00:09:00,139
So a very useful phrase when talking about incrementing someone or, as you said, decreasing a decrease of five percent.

104
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,220
Now, Mr.

105
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,960
Ford used a very interesting phrase when referring to the Chinese market.

106
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,139
Obviously, it's a very big market.

107
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,620
And he says that the computer ownership stands at around 60 million.

108
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:18,100
But of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare it to the population of China.

109
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:18,639
That's right.

110
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,120
So what does this mean?

111
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,259
It's a big percentage or a small percentage?

112
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,240
Very, very small.

113
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:23,919
All right.

114
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,360
So what he's saying here is it's like a drop of water in an ocean.

115
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,019
So a drop of water is so small you don't even notice it.

116
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,620
You don't even see it because the ocean is so big.

117
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:36,179
And so you can use this in many different ways.

118
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,460
You can say, hey, you know, five dollars is just a drop in the ocean.

119
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,340
It's not really important because it's very little money.

120
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,039
That's right.

121
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:44,539
That's right.

122
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,200
So it's sort of like a metaphor saying, you know what, it's very insignificant.

123
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,840
It's just a drop of water in an ocean.

124
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,659
It's not really something you can notice.

125
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,279
That's right.

126
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,200
Just a drop in the ocean.

127
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,860
And now at the very end of today's speech, we heard the phrase to compare and contrast.

128
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,600
So we're talking about the X420 computer brand itself.

129
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,220
Now, what is what does Mr.

130
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,279
Ford mean when he says to compare and contrast?

131
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:21,340
So when we mentioned the word compare, we are basically trying to determine how they are similar in many ways, the characteristics of how they are similar.

132
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:25,159
And to contrast is how they are different, right?

133
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,000
That's right.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,620
So let's let's use an example.

135
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,379
Perhaps we could say Pepsi and Coca-Cola.

136
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,980
Let's compare and contrast.

137
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,399
So they're both carbonated beverages.

138
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,080
They are both sweet.

139
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,379
And they're both there's pretty much the same color.

140
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,139
That's right.

141
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,159
And they're also fairly cheap.

142
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,740
They have about the same price.

143
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,820
But I would say that Coca-Cola is tastes more like prune.

144
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,200
So that would be a contrasting characteristic of Coca-Cola is that maybe it tastes a little bit sweeter.

145
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:56,860
It does.

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,820
And you could also say it's easier to find Coca-Cola Pepsi is less, less easy to find sometimes.

147
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,399
That's right.

148
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
Another way that they're different.

149
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,659
So basically, to compare and contrast is to point out how two things are similar and how they're different.

150
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:10,600
That's right.

151
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:18,799
So we've had a lot of interesting phrases there, I think very useful if you're talking about business and marketing and sales.

152
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,759
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time.

153
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,440
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

154
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,120
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share.

155
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,059
And this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

156
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,779
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

157
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,620
Well, the answer is simple.

158
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,100
There's a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for profit.

159
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,919
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

160
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,539
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population.

161
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:08,480
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

162
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:20,019
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4 to 5%, an increase of 1,000% compared with the 1980s.

163
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:33,460
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.

164
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:39,200
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.

165
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,860
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

166
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:51,600
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

167
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,879
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

168
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,940
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself, and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

169
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,139
All right, we're back.

170
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,100
As we mentioned, this is just a part of our presentation series.

171
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,480
We're going to keep on talking with Mr.

172
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,500
Ford as he discusses business and a lot of other very interesting and useful skills for talking in public.

173
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:26,580
That's right.

174
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,340
So the goal of this series is to help you feel better when you're giving a presentation in English.

175
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:40,019
We all know it's very, very hard to talk in English when you're still learning, but it's even harder to talk alone, to give a speech or a presentation.

176
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:49,039
The point of this series is to really give you those skills and to help teach you some of the key phrases and words that you'll be using in your presentations in the future.

177
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:49,679
That's right.

178
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:55,919
So if you have any questions or any doubts, we are always available at EnglishPod.com, and we'll see everyone there.

179
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,299
Bye.

180
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:56,679
Bye.
