00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have part two of a very important and very valuable series about giving presentations.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
As you well know, we started this series.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a ten-part series, and today we're going to talk about sales and charts and graphs and more or less explaining maybe a PowerPoint presentation.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So you're going to learn some wonderful ways of talking about changes in markets and marketing.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what you've heard.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Well, the answer is simple.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There is a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for profit.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5 percent of the total world population.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4 to 5 percent, an increase of 1,000 percent compared with the 1980s.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
For us at Alfa, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All right, we're back, so now let's start with Language Takeaway.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, so in the first part of what Mr.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ford is saying, he mentions something called market share.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, Margo, what is market share?

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right, everyone is competing for market share, and this is basically a small portion of your available market.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, for example, if you sell perfumes, women's perfume, then your market share is maybe women who are 18 to 35 years old in your city or in your town or in your country.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I see.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right, so when we're talking about market share, because we're sharing a piece of this big pie, we're going to talk about that in terms of a percentage, so 30% or 15%.

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's right.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I think maybe one of the clearest examples is Coca-Cola has I think maybe a 60% market share of the carbonated beverages market.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Interesting, so you could say that Apple has a 50% market share of the personal computing industry.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Very good, so this is what we refer to as market share.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, as we continue to talk about markets, we have two very interesting words when we refer to a developed market and a developing market.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so a developed market is something that has been polished and grown over time.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Perhaps we talk about the developed world being Western Europe and America, but then we have developing markets, and those are markets that are still trying to figure out kind of what's going on.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They're growing.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
They're usually growing much faster than a developed market.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So again, when we're talking about maybe computers, we consider, for example, the United States a developed market.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Many people already have a computer or express the desire to buy one, and so maybe a developing market are some of the African countries where they're still growing, and so now they're beginning to purchase more and more computers.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, so developed and developing, two different ways to describe markets.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now, after that, we hear this phrase, cutthroat.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So someone asks, why is this market so cutthroat?

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What does this mean?

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A cutthroat business or a cutthroat industry.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It means that it's very, very competitive.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, so cutthroat, we're actually talking about maybe having a knife and cutting someone else's throat, but it's just a metaphor.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a way of saying, yes, this is very competitive, so you're not actually cutting someone's throat.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Everyone is fighting for that market share, so it's very cutthroat.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Everyone is fighting very, very hard, but you're not literally killing someone or cutting their throats.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And you could even use this to talk about a sporting event.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You could say, you know, it was a cutthroat game.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right, that's right.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So anything that's very competitive or very close.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So to finish off language takeaway, when Mr.

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ford was, towards the end of his presentation, he said that the rewards could be very, very big in a very short timeframe.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So when we say the word timeframe, we mean period of time.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not like, you know, 2 p.m.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's like from May to June, we have this short timeframe.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's only two months long, so timeframe is a window or a period.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's right, so this is what he is referring to, is that in a very short period or in this period of time, they could make a lot of money, a timeframe.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right, but how long would a long timeframe be?

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe a couple of years.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
All right, so you can have a short timeframe and a long timeframe.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, why don't we take a look at our dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

74
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, the answer is simple.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There is a huge untapped potential market out there, with a huge untapped potential for profit.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4-5%, an increase of 1,000% compared with the 1980s.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.

84
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All right, we're back.

89
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So now we've picked out a couple of different phrases for you.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's check those out now on Fluency Builder.

91
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So in today's dialogue, we heard Mr.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ford talk about some numbers.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He's talking about growth and change in the market.

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And he says, with figures to around four to five percent, we've got an overall increase of one thousand percent.

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So this phrase, an increase of, very, very common when you're talking about growth of maybe revenue or when you're talking about the growth of a company or sales, for example.

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So it's important to remember here that this is a fixed phrase.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We say an increase of 10 percent or an increase of 30 percent.

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But you can use the same phrase with drops in percentages or money.

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So you can say a decrease of 10 percent.

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That means that you go down 10 percent or a decrease of 100 percent.

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's right.

103
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So a very useful phrase when talking about incrementing someone or, as you said, decreasing a decrease of five percent.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, Mr.

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ford used a very interesting phrase when referring to the Chinese market.

106
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Obviously, it's a very big market.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And he says that the computer ownership stands at around 60 million.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare it to the population of China.

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's right.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So what does this mean?

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's a big percentage or a small percentage?

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Very, very small.

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All right.

114
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So what he's saying here is it's like a drop of water in an ocean.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So a drop of water is so small you don't even notice it.

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't even see it because the ocean is so big.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And so you can use this in many different ways.

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can say, hey, you know, five dollars is just a drop in the ocean.

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's not really important because it's very little money.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's right.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's right.

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So it's sort of like a metaphor saying, you know what, it's very insignificant.

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's just a drop of water in an ocean.

124
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's not really something you can notice.

125
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's right.

126
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Just a drop in the ocean.

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And now at the very end of today's speech, we heard the phrase to compare and contrast.

128
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So we're talking about the X420 computer brand itself.

129
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, what is what does Mr.

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ford mean when he says to compare and contrast?

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So when we mentioned the word compare, we are basically trying to determine how they are similar in many ways, the characteristics of how they are similar.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And to contrast is how they are different, right?

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's right.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So let's let's use an example.

135
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Perhaps we could say Pepsi and Coca-Cola.

136
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's compare and contrast.

137
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So they're both carbonated beverages.

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They are both sweet.

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And they're both there's pretty much the same color.

140
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right.

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And they're also fairly cheap.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They have about the same price.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But I would say that Coca-Cola is tastes more like prune.

144
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So that would be a contrasting characteristic of Coca-Cola is that maybe it tastes a little bit sweeter.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It does.

146
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And you could also say it's easier to find Coca-Cola Pepsi is less, less easy to find sometimes.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's right.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Another way that they're different.

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So basically, to compare and contrast is to point out how two things are similar and how they're different.

150
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's right.

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So we've had a lot of interesting phrases there, I think very useful if you're talking about business and marketing and sales.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We continue to fight with our competitors for market share.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You may ask yourself, why is this market so cutthroat?

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, the answer is simple.

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There's a huge untapped potential market out there with a huge untapped potential for profit.

159
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
As you can see, in the 1980s, computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Since the 1990s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.

162
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In the new millennium, we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners, with figures rising to around 4 to 5%, an increase of 1,000% compared with the 1980s.

163
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically, we can see in chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Now of course, 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China.

165
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
For us at Alpha, and of course for all of our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If we do this right, we really can reap huge rewards in a very short time frame.

168
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'd now like to move on to discuss the X420 brand itself, and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right, we're back.

170
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
As we mentioned, this is just a part of our presentation series.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We're going to keep on talking with Mr.

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Ford as he discusses business and a lot of other very interesting and useful skills for talking in public.

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's right.

174
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So the goal of this series is to help you feel better when you're giving a presentation in English.

175
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We all know it's very, very hard to talk in English when you're still learning, but it's even harder to talk alone, to give a speech or a presentation.

176
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The point of this series is to really give you those skills and to help teach you some of the key phrases and words that you'll be using in your presentations in the future.

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's right.

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So if you have any questions or any doubts, we are always available at EnglishPod.com, and we'll see everyone there.

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Bye.

180
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Bye.
