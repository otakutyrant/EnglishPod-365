EnglishPod.com Hey John, I haven't seen you in ages.

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:09,400
What's new?

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,880
What have you been up to?

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,839
Pete, nice to see you.

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:19,420
Well, on top of the norm, you know, life and kids and work, I've actually gotten into doing some trading.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,399
Trading?

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,920
You a big guy?

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,140
What are you trading?

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,019
Currencies.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,260
Currencies?

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,800
As in euros, dollars, pounds and rupees?

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,420
It's called Forex, foreign exchange.

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,619
The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,539
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

15
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:42,039
I don't understand.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,920
You're buying and selling money?

17
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,140
You got it.

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,979
Just last night I made 150 US dollars.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,219
Last night?

20
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:51,320
Yeah, it's a 24-hour market.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,960
I had bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price, but last night it appreciated drastically.

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,079
So I made a split-second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,959
I've also done some trading with Swiss francs and Australian dollars and Hong Kong dollars.

24
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,140
I've made some good profits, but I've also suffered some losses.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,239
Depends on a lot of factors, just like any other market.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,200
In total, I've made about 500 US dollars in the past few months.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,099
You're kidding!

28
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,239
I'm on.

29
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,280
Where do I sign up?
