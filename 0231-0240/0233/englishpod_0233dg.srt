EnglishPod.com Hey John, I haven't seen you in ages.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's new?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What have you been up to?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Pete, nice to see you.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, on top of the norm, you know, life and kids and work, I've actually gotten into doing some trading.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Trading?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You a big guy?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What are you trading?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Currencies.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Currencies?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
As in euros, dollars, pounds and rupees?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's called Forex, foreign exchange.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't understand.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're buying and selling money?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You got it.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just last night I made 150 US dollars.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Last night?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, it's a 24-hour market.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I had bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price, but last night it appreciated drastically.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So I made a split-second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've also done some trading with Swiss francs and Australian dollars and Hong Kong dollars.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I've made some good profits, but I've also suffered some losses.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Depends on a lot of factors, just like any other market.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In total, I've made about 500 US dollars in the past few months.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're kidding!

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm on.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Where do I sign up?
