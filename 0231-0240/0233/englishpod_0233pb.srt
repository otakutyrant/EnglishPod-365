00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Catherine, and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all about money.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are trading money.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're actually negotiating in this very popular topic nowadays, the whole foreign exchange market.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we're talking about currency, which is the money of different countries.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
For example, the currency of Ecuador is?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The US dollar.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hard to believe, but true.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll tell you all about it later.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, the currency of America is also the US dollar, so with that in mind, let's listen to today's dialogue.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, John.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I haven't seen you in ages.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's new?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What have you been up to?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Pete, nice to see you.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, on top of the norm, you know, life and kids and work, I've actually gotten into doing some trading.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Trading?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You, big guy?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What are you trading?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Currencies.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Currencies?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As in euros, dollars, pounds, and rupees?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's called Forex, foreign exchange.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't understand.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're buying and selling money?

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You got it.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Just last night, I made 150 US dollars.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Last night?

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, it's a 24-hour market.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price, but last night, it appreciated drastically, so I made a split-second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've also done some trading with Swiss francs and Australian dollars and Hong Kong dollars.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've made some good profits, but I've also suffered some losses.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Depends on a lot of factors, just like any other market.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In total, I've made about 500 US dollars in the past few months.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're kidding.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm on.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where do I sign up?

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right, we're back.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So this guy is trading currencies, as we heard, and, well, we're going to talk about a lot of the specific vocab that he used about this topic, so why don't we take a look at some of those now in Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, the first thing I think we should talk about is one of the first things that he says, actually.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Peter says, I haven't seen you in ages.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I haven't seen you in ages, right.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So obviously, he hasn't seen him in a long time, and that's what in ages means.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we haven't seen each other in ages.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So what other ways can we use in ages, or the word ages?

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, you could actually say, it's been ages.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So that means it's been a long time.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's been a long time, or we haven't gone out for ages.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, so then you can use it with for, for ages.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For ages, in ages.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So the key word here is ages, which means a long time.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Long time.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And, well, he hasn't seen him in ages, and the guy's like, well, you know what, I've actually gone into trading.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So that means he's started doing some trading.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Right.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now, trading is a very broad word, because you can trade, as in this case, currencies, which is basically to buy and sell currencies.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But you could also trade stocks, right?

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You can trade stocks, or even people that are involved in import-export, they are involved in trading.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So basically, trading is buying and selling something.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Right.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So you're trading.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You are exchanging a product for money, or money for a product.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But the difference is, you're not actually making any products.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Right.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so that's called trading.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're not really manufacturing anything, you're just exchanging goods and services and money.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All right.

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So that's for trading.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Moving on, he was explaining how the foreign exchange market works, and he says, I don't have to invest a huge amount.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I put in a margin deposit, and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So Marco, here's the question.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What is a margin deposit?

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Because a deposit is basically money that you put, invest somewhere, or that you pay in.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, basically, a margin deposit is like a percentage.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So he basically puts in a percentage of what he intends to buy.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So for example, a margin deposit of $1,000 might be $1, or $10.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, so maybe if it's $10, you're talking about a 1% margin.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Mm-hmm, exactly.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So that's what he means by a margin deposit, and that's why he explains that you don't have to have a large amount of money in order to trade in the foreign exchange market.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You just put in a margin deposit, and then you can work around that.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, it sounds pretty easy, but then he explains some more details about it, and it gets to be a little bit more complicated.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He explained about how he makes money and how he bought some Chinese renminbi, and then he sold it because it appreciated drastically.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So he bought it when it was cheap, and he sold it when it was expensive, so the price changed.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Right.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So this kind of price change, when something goes from cheap to expensive, it's called appreciating, appreciation.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So the verb is to appreciate.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's very different from using it in the sense of you appreciate someone, right?

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Like, oh, I really appreciate you.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, no, it's very different.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
We could say this about most goods or investments.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For example, my parents bought a house in 1970, and the value of the house has really appreciated over the last 40 years, so now the value is much, much greater.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And actually, just mentioning it while we're on the topic, to appreciate, as you say, is something becomes more expensive.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The opposite, when something becomes cheaper or maybe the value goes down, is to depreciate.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Depreciate, so that D at the beginning means it's going down.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Right.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, and moving on to our last word for language takeaway.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So when he was talking about selling the Chinese currency, he said that he sold it at an amazing bid.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, let's talk about bid here, B-I-D, bid.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What does this mean?

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So to bid is to place an offer for something.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, so for example, at an auction, when someone is selling many old objects or some art, I can bid $100, and maybe someone doesn't accept my bid, but if they do accept my bid, then I pay for it.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Right.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So basically, a bid is just another way of saying an offer.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're offering a certain amount of money for that product or that service, and you see it a lot, for example, on eBay, right?

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So eBay is an auction website, basically, and someone who's selling someone can see many, many bids, and they select the best bid.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Exactly.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So that's what a bid is.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So that's all we have for language takeaway.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's move on now to fluency builder.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
fluency builder Marco, what have you been up to lately?

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I never see you.

127
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is actually a very common sentence, what have you been up to, but most English learners don't really understand what it means.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, this is a really interesting point because I say this all the time.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is very native, very colloquial.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What have you been up to?

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's almost the same as saying what's up.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What's up?

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Or where have you been recently?

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What have you been doing recently?

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How's your life?

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So this part, up to, what have you been up to?

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It doesn't really say much if you translate it literally, but basically it's what have you been doing?

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What have you been spending your time on?

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So to be up to means to do something, to do.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And there are many other definitions of up to, but in this case, what have you been up to means that.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What have you been doing?

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So next time you see a friend you haven't seen in a week or two, you can say, what have you been up to?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All right.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And John answers, well, you know, on top of the norm, wife, kids, and work, that phrase right there, on top of the norm.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, the norm here means the normal.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That means basically normal life.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've been working, I've got my kids, my wife, on top of the norm.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Just life is normal.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Right.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So the norm are the wife, kids, and work.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
On top of that, I'm actually gone into trading, right?

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So the normal situation, the normal life is wife, kids, and work, and then he's saying on top of that, I've actually been doing this.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Exactly.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And now moving on to when he's explaining again the market and the currencies, he talked about an asking price.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Asking price.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Remember we were talking about bids?

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We could say that someone has an asking price, which is the price they would like to receive for an object or a service that they are selling.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And so, for example, I'm going to sell my desk.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
My asking price is 100 bucks, $100.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Maybe you don't want to pay that much, but my asking price is the way that I'm going to start.

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's how much I want for it.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So that's your asking price.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's how much you ideally want to sell it for, but you can negotiate.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You are willing to accept maybe a lower offer.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Exactly.

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And what is our last phrase?

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
A split second decision.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is really, really important.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
These words go together very often.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Split second and decision.

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So that basically means that you made a very quick decision.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's right.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Split second.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Very fast.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's almost like it's less than a second.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And so a split second decision means a decision in no time.

183
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's very, very quick.

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So we can actually mix split second with other things, right?

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
For example, so maybe you can say he reacted in a split second and avoided the crash.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So good for him.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He reacted quickly enough to avoid the accident.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So split second, very fast, very quickly.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A split second decision, a decision that was made very fast.

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

193
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So that's all we have for Fluency Builder.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When we go back, listen to this dialogue one more time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey, John, I haven't seen you in ages.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What's new?

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What have you been up to?

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Pete.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Nice to see you.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, on top of the norm, you know, life and kids and work, I've actually gotten into doing some trading.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Trading?

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You a big guy?

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you trading?

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Currencies.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Currencies?

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
As in euros, dollars, pounds and rupees?

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's called Forex, foreign exchange.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to a hundred times that much.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't understand.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're buying and selling money?

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You got it.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Just last night, I made 150 US dollars.

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Last night?

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a 24 hour market.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'd bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price, but last night it appreciated drastically.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I made a split second decision and sold all of my RMB at an amazing bid.

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I've also done some trading with Swiss francs and Australian dollars and Hong Kong dollars.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I've made some good profits, but I've also suffered some losses.

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Depends on a lot of factors, just like any other market.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
In total, I've made about 500 US dollars in the past few months.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're kidding.

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm on.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Where do I sign up?

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So Marco, you have to explain this to me.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We're talking about currency today.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So every nation has a currency.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
For example, in the dialogue, we learned that India has rupees, pounds are in Britain.

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Britain has pounds and Australia has Australian dollars.

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
America has American dollars.

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But you just said earlier that Ecuador has American dollars too.

233
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's right.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Actually, Ecuador went through a very difficult economic situation in late 1998, early 1999, where there was a hyperinflation.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So basically, there was an inflation that was very, very, very large.

236
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So that means that the old currency lost its value very fast.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Exactly.

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So for example, if the currency before in Ecuador used to be sucres.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So if 10 sucres was $1, all of a sudden, 50 sucres was $1.

240
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And it got to the point where goods and services went from $3,000 to $1 to $25,000 to $1.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, OK.

242
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So people have bags full of money and it's not really worth anything anymore.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Exactly.

244
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So what happened was the central bank couldn't absorb this currency depreciation.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They couldn't really regulate prices.

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Obviously, salaries were about the same.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So you have a lot less money comparatively.

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And so the government decided that there were two options.

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Either they would follow Argentina's example, what they did a couple of years before, and set a fixed rate.

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So in Argentina, it's three pesos to a dollar.

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Or we would just get rid of our currency and just use US dollars.

252
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So that's what they did, right?

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
They used US dollars.

254
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And now, if you ever travel to Ecuador, you will use US dollars.

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The same exact bills that you use in the US are the same exact bills in Ecuador.

256
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So no need to exchange currency.

257
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No need to exchange currency.

258
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And that's why, I guess, there are many factors that people say are a lot better.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For example, trading has become a lot less complicated because now you're negotiating in US dollars as in everywhere else in the world.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But then other things, as you know, not having a national currency also affects.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So there are a lot of things going on.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But it's an interesting topic.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Very interesting.

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, so maybe for those of you who are listening, you could tell us about your country and your currency.

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What do you use?

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What do you spend money on?

267
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And do people buy and trade currencies where you're from?

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Exactly.

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Or maybe you can even enlighten us with the foreign, with the exchange rate maybe.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Usually it's a good question to ask, how much is a liter of milk?

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Or how much is a haircut?

272
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Right.

273
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because these are things that everyone needs.

274
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So the price doesn't change that much.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Exactly.

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We're really curious to know how inexpensive or maybe very expensive your country is.

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So come to EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.
