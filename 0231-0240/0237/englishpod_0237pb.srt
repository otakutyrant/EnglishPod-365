00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we've got a very special lesson for you all about time.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to concentrate a little bit on some specific points of grammar this time, and we're going to talk about the morning routine, what you do in the mornings.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, let's take a look first at the word routine.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is our vocabulary preview for today.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Vocabulary Preview All right, so a routine or the morning routine.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is a routine?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A routine is basically your habit for a certain period of time.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So for example, your routine in the morning is what you do when you wake up, get breakfast and go to work.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You can also have an evening routine.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's what you always do before you go to bed.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Exactly.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So everyone has a routine, what they do in the mornings, maybe what you do at night before going to bed.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So that's what we're going to talk about today.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You can also have an exercise routine.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So basically anything with steps, one, two, three, four, five, that you always do the same way.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's the routine.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Right.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So that's what we're going to take a look at today.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why don't we jump right into our dialogue and listen to Stephanie's routine.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Stephanie, did you just get to school?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That was about an hour and a half ago.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This happens all the time.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why do you always take so long to get ready in the mornings?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a skill.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What can I say?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't know why.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I just have a long routine.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please explain because it makes no sense to me.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How can a girl's routine be so complicated?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you're out the door.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Half an hour tops.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Every day I wake up and head straight for the shower.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Every second day I wash my hair.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If it's a hair washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under 20 minutes.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I take a long time to get dressed in the morning.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
From time to time, I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blow dry it straight.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And then because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat iron it to keep it from frizzing.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's another 20 minutes or so.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
After that, I have my daily makeup routine.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
True.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not funny.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
All right, we're back.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So obviously she has a very complicated routine.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know if all girls are like this.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm not like this, but I think a lot of girls and some guys are.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Really?

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't want to be sexist here.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I know some guys who take their time in the morning and are very, very particular about the way that they look.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, yeah.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I imagine everyone has their morning routine in different ways, and it was interesting to see how she described it.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So why don't we take a look at language takeaway?

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Language takeaway.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So today's language takeaway, like I said at the beginning of the podcast, is all about time.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So we're going to look at some of these important time adverbs.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
These are called adverbs of frequency, and basically they are telling us how we do things.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If we do something all the time or if we never do something.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Or everything in between.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Exactly.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the first couple we have today are very, very common words.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're going to hear these a lot.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The first one is frequently.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, frequently.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So if you do something frequently, consider it to be about 75% of the time, maybe a little bit more, almost 85% of the time.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So it's not always, but it's very often.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So for example, so I frequently forget to take my keys when I'm leaving the house, which is a very big problem.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Exactly.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So considering out of seven days, maybe you forget your keys five days.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's a good.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So that's frequently.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now let's move on to another one that's actually a lot less.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We talk about seldom.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, Marco has told me that he seldom forgets his keys.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That means he almost always remembers them.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Right.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So seldom is a negative adverb.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's saying that almost never.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So if I say, for example, I seldom go to the movies.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's too bad.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I like the movies.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Right.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, that means that I maybe go to the movie theater once a month.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Not very often.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Seldom.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Not very often.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Seldom.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now going back to a positive adverb of frequency, we have often.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You described frequently as very often.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's right.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So I could also say I often forget my keys or it often rains in tropical places.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This means this is a common thing.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Exactly.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Exactly.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So again, let's consider it to be about 70 to 80% of the time.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now with pronunciation, some people like to pronounce often, right?

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They kind of leave out the strong T sound while other people say often.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Both forms are correct, right?

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They're both correct.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So you're safe using either of these.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And our fourth adverb of frequency is also a positive one.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And we say usually.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Usually means this is something that you do pretty consistently.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I usually brush my hair before I go to sleep.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That means not always, but almost every day.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So let's consider that of seven days, you do it six times.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I usually do this.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So usually is, again, very, very common.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And something in between, maybe 60% of the time, 50% of the time we say regularly.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, I think of the word regularly as being very closely related to regular.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So basically if I have a schedule, I do the same thing every day.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I do it regularly.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But sometimes there's a special occasion.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
For example, I regularly run five kilometers after work when I go to the gym.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But sometimes when I want to go out with my friends, I don't run.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So it's not always, but it is pretty regular.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So regularly means you do it very often, but there are some exceptions.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now those are our adverbs of frequency, but we have a couple of other phrases that are very similar.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So we want to take a look at those as well.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go back to the beginning of Stephanie's routine when she said that every day I wake up.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So every day means 100% of the time every single day.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Monday to Sunday.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So obviously you wake up every day.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Or I brush my teeth twice every day.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So that's 100% of the time.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now if we say every second day, what does that mean?

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That means Monday yes, Tuesday no, Wednesday yes, Thursday no, or any day.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So basically she says, I wash my hair every second day.

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That means one day I wash my hair, but the next day I don't.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The day after that though, I wash it again.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Every second day.

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So you can say every second day.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And I think you can also say every other day.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Every other day.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So every other day or every second day.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He calls his mother every other day.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Very good.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And she also said that every now and then I remember to choose my outfit.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, this one's interesting.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is not very frequent.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This is basically saying sometimes.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sometimes.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So now and then.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Every now and then means I sometimes do it.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I sometimes don't do it.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Every now and then I really want to eat chocolate.

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So I buy a candy bar.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So maybe you want to eat chocolate twice in a month.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Not very often.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Not very often.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And another one that's very similar is from time to time.

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So Marco said that he doesn't go to the movies very frequently.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So he goes from time to time.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I can say I seldom go to the movies or I can say I like to go to the movies from time to time.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Or this girl is describing her appearance.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She says from time to time I put my hair up.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So that means most of the time.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That means sometimes it's down.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sometimes it's up.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So as you can see, there are many different ways of describing the frequency or how many times you do certain actions or your routine, right?

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So you can use this with a lot of things when you're describing.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And we encourage you to try some of these new ones because a lot of English learners use the same time adverbs whenever they speak.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So try and really use some of these and challenge yourself.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All right.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So that's all we have for language takeaway.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Fluency builder.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,000
OK, so using some of these adverbs, I could say I can say I regularly make a pot of coffee in the morning.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
OK, so a pot of coffee, you regularly make a pot of coffee.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That means you like to drink coffee every day.

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I always need my cup of coffee in the morning, so I usually make it first thing.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So a pot of coffee.

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We know what a cup of coffee is.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But a pot of coffee, what is a pot?

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A pot is basically the container that you use when you brew coffee, when you make it.

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So you put the coffee beans in the machine and instead of having a cup underneath, you have a bigger container that's a pot.

210
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can also have a pot of tea.

211
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Exactly.

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's many cups, usually eight or ten cups.

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All right.

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And remember that verb to brew coffee.

215
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think it's a very nice kind of fancy way of saying making coffee.

216
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You brew a pot of coffee.

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm brewing some coffee.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All right.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So apart from coffee and all of these things, let's take a look at some of the specific phrases that she used when she was talking about her hair, because I think her hair is very complicated.

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It is very complicated.

221
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sometimes she washes her hair, sometimes she doesn't wash her hair.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sometimes she blow dries it straight.

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OK, so to blow dry means that you use a blow dryer.

224
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is a machine that uses electricity to blow hot air on your hair so that your hair will dry quickly.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But you can blow dry your hair in many ways.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Some people have curly hair and they have special tools for making their hair curly.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But she says she blow dries it straight.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That means she makes it straight with the hot air.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So I think the way you do this is you take the blow dryer and a brush and you brush while you blow dry, right?

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Making lines.

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
See, I know a little bit about this, even though I don't have long enough hair for this.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, maybe you are secretly one of those guys who has a routine like this woman.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't think I can take this much time in the shower and brushing my hair.

235
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But moving on, actually, I also know this next phrase to flat iron your hair.

236
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
OK, so flat iron is a noun and a verb.

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I use a flat iron or I can flat iron my hair.

238
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is a tool that we use that's very, very hot.

239
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Think of an iron.

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's very, very hot.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it basically presses my hair and makes it very, very, very thin and flat and straight.

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So I think people that have straight hair don't need to really flat iron their hair.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But if you have very curly hair, then you need it.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So what's the difference?

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Give us the insight here.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why wouldn't you just blow dry it straight?

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why do you need to flat iron it?

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Because a flat iron makes it more flat.

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It makes your hair stick together more and it's much, much, much hotter than a blow dryer.

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
OK, so I guess if you use a blow dryer, then you have puffy hair or like the next word that she described frizzy hair.

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
OK, so the adjective to describe this kind of hair is frizzy.

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
For example, when it's very rainy, my hair is frizzy.

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That means that it sticks out.

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's very thick and not straight.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
OK.

256
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's not curly, but it's, you know, it's messy.

257
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It kind of inflates.

258
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's right.

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's like a little balloon.

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But the verb here is to frizz.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So my hair is frizzing.

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000
OK.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And that means that it's getting like this, bigger or inflated.

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's right.

265
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So usually girls who have this problem have it worse during very humid or rainy days.

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Not so bad when it's dry.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
OK, so I actually have a little bit of frizzy hair.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's why I have to use some sort of hair gel, hair gel or mousse.

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
See, it's not because I'm vain.

270
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's just because if I don't use this, I'll come in looking like a lion.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I don't think I think I might have to insist that that happens sometime soon.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We can take a picture and put it on our website, Englishbot.com.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
For sure, for sure.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
All right.

275
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time?

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Stephanie, did you just get to school?

277
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That was about an hour and a half ago.

279
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This happens all the time.

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why do you always take so long to get ready in the mornings?

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's a skill.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What can I say?

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know why.

284
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I just have a long routine.

285
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Please explain, because it makes no sense to me.

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
How can a girl's routine be so complicated?

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You get up, you shower, you get dressed, you brush your teeth, you're out the door.

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Half an hour tops.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling.

290
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings.

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower.

293
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Every second day, I wash my hair.

294
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If it's a hair washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice, because it gets really oily.

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out, too, because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under 20 minutes.

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew.

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I take a long time to get dressed in the morning.

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Every now and then, I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning.

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry, so then I have to style my hair.

300
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
From time to time, I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blow-dry it straight.

301
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat iron it to keep it from frizzing.

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's another 20 minutes or so.

303
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
After that, I have my daily makeup routine.

304
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,000
True.

305
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants.

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?

307
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Not funny.

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:12,000
All right, so actually talking about morning routines, and we've given you so many tools, I think it would be a great idea if our users came to our site, EnglishPod.com, and posted a part of their morning routine trying to use as many adverbs of frequency as possible.

309
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's a great suggestion, and to get you all started, I could give you a little bit of my routine.

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
All right, let's hear it.

311
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Every morning when I wake up, I turn off the alarm, which is very loud, and I take a shower.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I always brush my teeth, and I usually brew a pot of coffee, although sometimes I don't have time to brew my coffee, and I wait until I arrive at my office.

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I seldom choose the clothes I will wear the night before.

314
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I almost always choose them in the morning, and generally I ride my bike to work, but not always.

315
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Okay, I think in the winter you seldom ride your bike to work.

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Every once in a while I ride it.

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
All right, see, you have a perfect example there of more or less what we expect, but also it would be interesting to see if you have any other type of routine.

318
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know some people wake up in the morning, and the first thing they do, they always walk their dog, for example.

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, that's very nice.

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Other people are very hungry, so they almost always eat right when they wake up.

321
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I eat before I brush my teeth.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Smart, actually.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
All right, so we want to hear from you guys.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Come to EnglishPod.com.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We'll see everyone there.

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Bye.
