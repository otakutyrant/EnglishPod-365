00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Every second day, I wash my hair.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If it's a hair washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then, I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out, too.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under 20 minutes.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I take a long time to get dressed in the morning.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Every now and then, I remember to choose my outfit the night before, but usually I do it in the morning.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour, at which time my hair is now semi-dry, so then I have to style my hair.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
From time to time, I'll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blow-dry it straight.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat iron it to keep it from frizzing.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's another 20 minutes or so.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
After that, I have my daily makeup routine.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
True.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Not funny.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thanks for watching!
