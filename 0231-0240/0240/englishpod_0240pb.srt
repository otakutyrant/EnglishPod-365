00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking all about animals.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is a very interesting topic, very important, because, well, a lot of people like to have pets.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're not going to the zoo.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're not talking about animals out in the forest or in nature.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're talking about pets that you keep at home.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's start right away with today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We have been over this a hundred times.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are not getting a pet.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Why not?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Come on.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I will.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll feed it, bathe it, and walk it every day.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What if we want to take a vacation?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who will we leave it with?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're planning on having children soon.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Fine.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's get a bird then.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
A parrot would be awesome.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'll tell you what.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can get you some hamsters, and we'll take it from there.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yay!

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All right.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're back.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So obviously, pets.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Having a pet at home is a very big responsibility, and well, this is what the couple was talking about.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But before we get into that discussion, why don't we take a look at five key words that we have picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, first off, the couple is talking about whether they should get a dog or a cat or a puppy or a kitty.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And when they start talking about dogs, they talk about what kinds of dogs or the breed of the dogs.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's look at this word.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They were talking about a German Shepherd or a Labrador.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And as you said, this is the breed.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Or maybe you can say a kind of dog.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, breed is the technical word to describe the kind of dog that something is.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So like you said, these are two examples.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There are many, many, many breeds that we can talk about, but we'll just leave it at this for now.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But we talked about some other kinds of animals today.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But we heard about some other kinds of animals today.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Not dogs, not cats, maybe smaller animals.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
One of the animals that the person mentioned was a ferret.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ooh, a ferret.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So this is a very small, kind of long animal.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You may have seen it, pets before.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They kind of look like, I don't know, kind of, they have the face of a rat maybe, but they're very long.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And they're thin.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They're very thin.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They're not like a rat because maybe their body shape is very, very different.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But they're also kind of small and they like to eat those little insects.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know if they have long tails like rats do.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think they have furry tails.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So that's a ferret.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But we also heard about a special kind of bird.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We talked about a parrot.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So as you know, there are many different kinds of birds.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You can see birds at your window all the time.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But birds that come from tropical places, usually very, very colorful birds, are called parrots.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So a parrot usually can talk or imitate what you say or sounds, right?

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They're actually very famous in the bird world for having a good ability to reproduce or to mimic the sounds that you make.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So if I say, hello, my parrot says, hello.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Exactly.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's really strange.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
They're very, very intelligent animals.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that's a parrot.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And our last animal is a very small animal, very popular also to have as a pet.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We talked about a hamster.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
A hamster.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So this is a little bit like a mouse.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They're furry.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're small.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're round.

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And they live in glass cages or fish tanks, usually.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They're very small.

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They don't really do much.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They're just little furry creatures and they, I don't know, they just eat all day.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sometimes they get them those little wheels that they can get inside and run around all day.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Or when I was a child and we had a hamster, we had a special plastic ball and you put the hamster in the ball and he would go around the house.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, exactly.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's very fun.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All right.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So we took a look at the pets that you can buy, domestic animals.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But taking a look at something very specific, when they were describing the responsibilities of having maybe a dog or a cat, they said they have to feed it, bathe it, walk it.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So obviously we know that feed it is to give it food, but what about bathe it?

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So you might know the word bath, okay?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's a thing.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a noun.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Bathe is a verb, to bathe.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so I can bathe myself.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That means I take a shower, I clean my body, or I can bathe something else like an animal.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So bathing a dog means basically washing a dog.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So it sounds very fancy or formal if you say, I'm going to go take a shower or you say, I'm going to go bathe.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We don't really say that as much, but we often say bathe when we're talking about cleaning other things.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Not a table, but cleaning people or animals.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you can say, did you bathe the baby?

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Or did you bathe the dog?

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, and also remember that even though the dog may be female or male, we don't give it gender, right?

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We describe it as it.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Animals are almost always considered it in English, although some people who really love their animals call it he or she.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So it's kind of your decision.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's not really incorrect if you say, Oh, my dog, she's so beautiful.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If it's a female, but you know, technically you should say my dog.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's very beautiful.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of words there.

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We have been over this a hundred times.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We are not getting a pet.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why not?

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Come on, just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will.

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What if we want to take a vacation?

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Who will we leave it with?

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We're planning on having children soon.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Fine.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's get a bird then.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
A parrot would be awesome.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll tell you what.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yay!

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All right, we're back.

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So now we've picked out four key phrases for you.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So at the very beginning of today's conversation, we hear the first person say, We've been over this a hundred times.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So what does this mean?

162
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This means that they've never talked about this before?

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, this is actually the opposite, but it's a way to exaggerate.

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Because obviously they haven't maybe talked about getting a pet a hundred times, but you're just making emphasis on the fact that we've talked about this many, many, many times.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And almost like you're tired of it.

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Like, oh, do we have to talk about this again?

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's like you said, an exaggeration to say, come on.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we've been over this a million times.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We've been over this a hundred times.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
These are all ways of saying, oh, we have to talk about this again.

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Exactly.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're emphasizing that, well, maybe you've done it too many times already.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
All right.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And well, when they were talking about the puppy or the kitty, the guy asked, well, who's going to look after the dog or the cat?

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So this is an important phrase.

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We're going to treat this as a kind of a chunk.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
These words go together to look after.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So we could look after a baby or look after the pet.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This means to watch or to care for.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
To take care.

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So maybe if you're going to go out tonight, you want to leave your son with a babysitter to look after him.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

185
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
To make sure that there are no problems or to make sure that he eats and goes to sleep.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Exactly.

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So to look after, to take care or to make sure he or she is okay.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All right.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And well, obviously the guy didn't want a puppy.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He didn't want a kitty.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So the girl was giving alternatives and said, well, how about we get a cat or a ferret?

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The phrase here, how about is very, very common in English.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I think a lot of people who learn English have a hard time knowing when to use this phrase, how about.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's right.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it's very simple.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The phrase how about is to give an alternative, right?

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Or a suggestion.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So for example, you and I are talking about where to eat lunch.

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know.

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And you give a suggestion.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You say, how about pizza?

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And I say, I don't know.

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How about McDonald's?

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We're giving suggestions or offering alternatives.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Exactly.

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So this is the correct way of using how about.

209
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Many students make the mistake of using it as to say, how was it or how did it go?

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right.

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Right.

212
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So how was your weekend?

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's correct.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How about your weekend?

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's incorrect.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, do not say that.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You want to say, how about this?

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How about that?

219
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How about a Coke?

220
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How about some food?

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
These are suggestions, but a real question you have to say how was or how is.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right.

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So never, never, never say how about your weekend.

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That is incorrect.

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And it's actually very common to hear this from students.

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So remember, it's not correct.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How about your weekend?

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Incorrect.

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So at the very end of the dialogue, we're talking about hamsters.

231
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

232
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's right.

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The phrase, take it from there.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's kind of a way of saying, look, let's start with something small or let's start with something simple and we will see how it goes.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So basically the woman is saying, I don't want to commit.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't want to agree to get a big animal like a dog or a cat because I'm not sure how it will be.

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not sure if it will be too much responsibility.

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So she's saying, okay, we'll get something small and then we'll wait and we'll see what happens.

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We'll take it from there.

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So it's basically saying, let's start slowly.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So for example, maybe, maybe a guy asks you out, right, and says, hey, will you marry me?

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And you say, whoa, let's go on a date first and we'll take it from there.

244
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Exactly.

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We'll see what happens.

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So let's start slowly.

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's, let's take things step by step.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All right.

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All right.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So that's all the phrases that we have for you today.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think we should listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We've been over this a hundred times.

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We are not getting a pet.

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why not?

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Come on.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I will.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day.

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What if we want to take a vacation?

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Who will we leave it with?

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We're planning on having children soon.

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Fine.

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's get a bird then.

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A parrot would be awesome.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll tell you what.

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All right, Catherine.

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So what about pets?

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you a big pet lover?

277
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you like ferrets, hamsters, all this good stuff?

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't like small pets.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I love big pets.

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So as a kid, we had both.

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
My brother really loved small animals like hamsters and ferrets and things like that.

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I just think they're a little bit stinky, they kind of smell funny.

283
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So ever since, I've always really liked big animals like dogs.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So you are a dog person?

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I am a dog person.

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is something interesting that we describe in English.

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
People say, I am a dog person, I am a cat person.

288
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's almost like it says something about your personality.

289
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So if you're a dog person, it means that you prefer dogs or you like dogs.

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you're a cat person, you prefer cats.

291
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And a lot of people really like dogs, but don't really like cats.

292
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Or they love cats and they can't stand dogs.

293
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right.

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think it even gets to the point where I've heard that maybe on dates, people will ask, so are you a dog person or a cat person?

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I know that's how I pick dates.

296
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What about you?

297
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Are you a dog person or a cat person?

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm definitely a dog person.

299
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Good answer.

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, I think cats are, I mean, they're nice and they're cuddly and I think they're very good indoor pets and a little bit more fun than maybe a hamster.

301
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I think dogs have more life and are more energetic.

302
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I think cats are very lazy.

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And I think sometimes cats like to play mind games.

304
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like they're so smart that they can control you.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That makes me uncomfortable.

306
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, right.

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So, well, there are a lot of other pets out there.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Some people have tarantulas, some people have iguanas, other people have fish.

309
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Or horses.

310
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Horses.

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you have enough space, right?

312
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So we want to know what kind of pets do you have or did you have as a kid?

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's right.

314
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let us know.

315
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We hope to see you there.

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
All right.

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Bye.

319
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Bye.
