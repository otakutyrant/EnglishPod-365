00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,339
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,140
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking all about animals.

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:10,160
That's right.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,100
This is a very interesting topic, very important, because, well, a lot of people like to have pets.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,160
That's right.

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:19,480
We're not going to the zoo.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,000
We're not talking about animals out in the forest or in nature.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,519
We're talking about pets that you keep at home.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:30,780
So let's start right away with today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

11
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,179
We have been over this a hundred times.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,799
We are not getting a pet.

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,939
Why not?

14
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:41,700
Come on.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,939
Just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,579
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

17
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,340
I will.

18
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,759
I'll feed it, bathe it, and walk it every day.

19
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,259
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,380
What if we want to take a vacation?

21
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,899
Who will we leave it with?

22
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,500
Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,399
Okay.

24
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,520
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

25
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,780
We're planning on having children soon.

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,379
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,400
Fine.

28
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,099
Let's get a bird then.

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,640
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,459
A parrot would be awesome.

31
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,459
I'll tell you what.

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,319
I can get you some hamsters, and we'll take it from there.

33
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,060
Yay!

34
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:29,959
All right.

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,480
We're back.

36
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,219
So obviously, pets.

37
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:38,540
Having a pet at home is a very big responsibility, and well, this is what the couple was talking about.

38
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,319
But before we get into that discussion, why don't we take a look at five key words that we have picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,200
Language Takeaway.

40
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:56,200
So, first off, the couple is talking about whether they should get a dog or a cat or a puppy or a kitty.

41
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,879
And when they start talking about dogs, they talk about what kinds of dogs or the breed of the dogs.

42
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,620
Let's look at this word.

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,260
That's right.

44
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,760
They were talking about a German Shepherd or a Labrador.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,659
And as you said, this is the breed.

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,580
Or maybe you can say a kind of dog.

47
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,639
That's right.

48
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:18,800
So, breed is the technical word to describe the kind of dog that something is.

49
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,620
So like you said, these are two examples.

50
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,939
There are many, many, many breeds that we can talk about, but we'll just leave it at this for now.

51
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,500
But we talked about some other kinds of animals today.

52
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:30,280
But we heard about some other kinds of animals today.

53
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,060
Not dogs, not cats, maybe smaller animals.

54
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,840
That's right.

55
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,240
One of the animals that the person mentioned was a ferret.

56
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,620
Ooh, a ferret.

57
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,960
So this is a very small, kind of long animal.

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,740
That's right.

59
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:45,860
You may have seen it, pets before.

60
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,360
They kind of look like, I don't know, kind of, they have the face of a rat maybe, but they're very long.

61
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,199
And they're thin.

62
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,099
They're very thin.

63
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,860
They're not like a rat because maybe their body shape is very, very different.

64
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,620
But they're also kind of small and they like to eat those little insects.

65
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,180
Yeah.

66
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,699
I don't know if they have long tails like rats do.

67
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
I think they have furry tails.

68
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,099
So that's a ferret.

69
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,900
But we also heard about a special kind of bird.

70
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,120
That's right.

71
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,539
We talked about a parrot.

72
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,460
So as you know, there are many different kinds of birds.

73
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,520
You can see birds at your window all the time.

74
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,900
But birds that come from tropical places, usually very, very colorful birds, are called parrots.

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:26,759
That's right.

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,780
So a parrot usually can talk or imitate what you say or sounds, right?

77
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:33,439
That's right.

78
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,240
They're actually very famous in the bird world for having a good ability to reproduce or to mimic the sounds that you make.

79
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,060
So if I say, hello, my parrot says, hello.

80
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,099
Exactly.

81
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,360
It's really strange.

82
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,159
They're very, very intelligent animals.

83
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,659
So that's a parrot.

84
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:55,060
And our last animal is a very small animal, very popular also to have as a pet.

85
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:57,199
We talked about a hamster.

86
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,319
A hamster.

87
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,800
So this is a little bit like a mouse.

88
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,520
They're furry.

89
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,340
They're small.

90
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:01,979
They're round.

91
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:06,680
And they live in glass cages or fish tanks, usually.

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:07,460
Yeah.

93
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,599
They're very small.

94
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,780
They don't really do much.

95
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:14,219
They're just little furry creatures and they, I don't know, they just eat all day.

96
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,600
Sometimes they get them those little wheels that they can get inside and run around all day.

97
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:18,980
That's right.

98
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:25,579
Or when I was a child and we had a hamster, we had a special plastic ball and you put the hamster in the ball and he would go around the house.

99
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:26,399
Yeah, exactly.

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,620
It's very fun.

101
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:27,980
All right.

102
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,259
So we took a look at the pets that you can buy, domestic animals.

103
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:47,100
But taking a look at something very specific, when they were describing the responsibilities of having maybe a dog or a cat, they said they have to feed it, bathe it, walk it.

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,680
So obviously we know that feed it is to give it food, but what about bathe it?

105
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,399
Okay.

106
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,000
So you might know the word bath, okay?

107
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,220
That's a thing.

108
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:56,879
It's a noun.

109
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,300
Bathe is a verb, to bathe.

110
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,899
And so I can bathe myself.

111
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,779
That means I take a shower, I clean my body, or I can bathe something else like an animal.

112
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,120
So bathing a dog means basically washing a dog.

113
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:10,740
Right.

114
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:17,699
So it sounds very fancy or formal if you say, I'm going to go take a shower or you say, I'm going to go bathe.

115
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:18,100
Yeah.

116
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,220
We don't really say that as much, but we often say bathe when we're talking about cleaning other things.

117
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,259
Not a table, but cleaning people or animals.

118
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:29,319
So you can say, did you bathe the baby?

119
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,680
Or did you bathe the dog?

120
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,240
Okay.

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,360
So, and also remember that even though the dog may be female or male, we don't give it gender, right?

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,160
We describe it as it.

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,860
That's right.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,879
Animals are almost always considered it in English, although some people who really love their animals call it he or she.

125
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:47,300
Right.

126
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:47,639
Right.

127
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,740
So it's kind of your decision.

128
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,339
It's not really incorrect if you say, Oh, my dog, she's so beautiful.

129
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,160
If it's a female, but you know, technically you should say my dog.

130
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,139
It's very beautiful.

131
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,560
Yeah.

132
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

133
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,639
So we've taken a look at a lot of words there.

134
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,540
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

135
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,639
We have been over this a hundred times.

136
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,279
We are not getting a pet.

137
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,379
Why not?

138
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,399
Come on, just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

139
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,000
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,759
I will.

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
I'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day.

142
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,699
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

143
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,800
What if we want to take a vacation?

144
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,300
Who will we leave it with?

145
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,939
Plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

146
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,860
Okay.

147
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,959
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

148
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,220
We're planning on having children soon.

149
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,860
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

150
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:43,800
Fine.

151
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,540
Let's get a bird then.

152
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,040
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

153
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,899
A parrot would be awesome.

154
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,879
I'll tell you what.

155
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,759
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

156
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,600
Yay!

157
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
All right, we're back.

158
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,019
So now we've picked out four key phrases for you.

159
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,500
Let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

160
00:07:07,619 --> 00:07:15,259
So at the very beginning of today's conversation, we hear the first person say, We've been over this a hundred times.

161
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,600
So what does this mean?

162
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,800
This means that they've never talked about this before?

163
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,779
No, this is actually the opposite, but it's a way to exaggerate.

164
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:34,560
Because obviously they haven't maybe talked about getting a pet a hundred times, but you're just making emphasis on the fact that we've talked about this many, many, many times.

165
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,740
And almost like you're tired of it.

166
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,620
Like, oh, do we have to talk about this again?

167
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,579
It's like you said, an exaggeration to say, come on.

168
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,939
So we've been over this a million times.

169
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,180
We've been over this a hundred times.

170
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,540
These are all ways of saying, oh, we have to talk about this again.

171
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,240
Exactly.

172
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:57,100
You're emphasizing that, well, maybe you've done it too many times already.

173
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,100
All right.

174
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:05,120
And well, when they were talking about the puppy or the kitty, the guy asked, well, who's going to look after the dog or the cat?

175
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:05,860
Okay.

176
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,420
So this is an important phrase.

177
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,980
We're going to treat this as a kind of a chunk.

178
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,759
These words go together to look after.

179
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
So we could look after a baby or look after the pet.

180
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:19,199
This means to watch or to care for.

181
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:19,660
Right.

182
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,300
To take care.

183
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:26,959
So maybe if you're going to go out tonight, you want to leave your son with a babysitter to look after him.

184
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:27,339
Right.

185
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,839
To make sure that there are no problems or to make sure that he eats and goes to sleep.

186
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,639
Exactly.

187
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,779
So to look after, to take care or to make sure he or she is okay.

188
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,220
All right.

189
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,220
And well, obviously the guy didn't want a puppy.

190
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,039
He didn't want a kitty.

191
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,759
So the girl was giving alternatives and said, well, how about we get a cat or a ferret?

192
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,460
Okay.

193
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,539
The phrase here, how about is very, very common in English.

194
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,700
I think a lot of people who learn English have a hard time knowing when to use this phrase, how about.

195
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,740
That's right.

196
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,980
So it's very simple.

197
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,179
The phrase how about is to give an alternative, right?

198
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:04,840
Okay.

199
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,620
Or a suggestion.

200
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,980
So for example, you and I are talking about where to eat lunch.

201
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,759
I don't know.

202
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,639
And you give a suggestion.

203
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,820
You say, how about pizza?

204
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
And I say, I don't know.

205
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,679
How about McDonald's?

206
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,740
We're giving suggestions or offering alternatives.

207
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,559
Exactly.

208
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,799
So this is the correct way of using how about.

209
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:31,100
Many students make the mistake of using it as to say, how was it or how did it go?

210
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:31,840
Right.

211
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,240
Right.

212
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,879
So how was your weekend?

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,759
That's correct.

214
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,840
How about your weekend?

215
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:37,679
That's incorrect.

216
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,000
No, do not say that.

217
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,000
You want to say, how about this?

218
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,080
How about that?

219
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,980
How about a Coke?

220
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,480
How about some food?

221
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,500
These are suggestions, but a real question you have to say how was or how is.

222
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:49,840
Right.

223
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,940
So never, never, never say how about your weekend.

224
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,120
That is incorrect.

225
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,559
And it's actually very common to hear this from students.

226
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,659
So remember, it's not correct.

227
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,919
How about your weekend?

228
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,419
No.

229
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,080
Incorrect.

230
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,539
So at the very end of the dialogue, we're talking about hamsters.

231
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,019
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

232
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,700
That's right.

233
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,919
The phrase, take it from there.

234
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:18,100
It's kind of a way of saying, look, let's start with something small or let's start with something simple and we will see how it goes.

235
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,659
So basically the woman is saying, I don't want to commit.

236
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:28,080
I don't want to agree to get a big animal like a dog or a cat because I'm not sure how it will be.

237
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:30,840
I'm not sure if it will be too much responsibility.

238
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,419
So she's saying, okay, we'll get something small and then we'll wait and we'll see what happens.

239
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,480
We'll take it from there.

240
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,179
That's right.

241
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:41,600
So it's basically saying, let's start slowly.

242
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,259
So for example, maybe, maybe a guy asks you out, right, and says, hey, will you marry me?

243
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:51,740
And you say, whoa, let's go on a date first and we'll take it from there.

244
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,299
Exactly.

245
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,399
We'll see what happens.

246
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:54,860
So let's start slowly.

247
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,519
Let's, let's take things step by step.

248
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,700
All right.

249
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:58,759
All right.

250
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,019
So that's all the phrases that we have for you today.

251
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:05,440
I think we should listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

252
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,080
We've been over this a hundred times.

253
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,679
We are not getting a pet.

254
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:16,840
Why not?

255
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,559
Come on.

256
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,840
Just a cute little puppy or a kitty.

257
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

258
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,220
I will.

259
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:25,679
I'll feed it, bathe it and walk it every day.

260
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,179
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

261
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,259
What if we want to take a vacation?

262
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:31,779
Who will we leave it with?

263
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,399
Plus our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

264
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,279
Okay.

265
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,419
How about we get a cat or a ferret?

266
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,659
We're planning on having children soon.

267
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,279
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

268
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,320
Fine.

269
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,019
Let's get a bird then.

270
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,539
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

271
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,360
A parrot would be awesome.

272
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,320
I'll tell you what.

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,299
I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

274
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,259
All right, Catherine.

275
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,200
So what about pets?

276
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,159
Are you a big pet lover?

277
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,139
Do you like ferrets, hamsters, all this good stuff?

278
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,340
I don't like small pets.

279
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,500
I love big pets.

280
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,940
So as a kid, we had both.

281
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,659
My brother really loved small animals like hamsters and ferrets and things like that.

282
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,480
I just think they're a little bit stinky, they kind of smell funny.

283
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,000
So ever since, I've always really liked big animals like dogs.

284
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,379
So you are a dog person?

285
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,220
I am a dog person.

286
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,740
This is something interesting that we describe in English.

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,240
People say, I am a dog person, I am a cat person.

288
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,919
It's almost like it says something about your personality.

289
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,480
So if you're a dog person, it means that you prefer dogs or you like dogs.

290
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,879
If you're a cat person, you prefer cats.

291
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,600
And a lot of people really like dogs, but don't really like cats.

292
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,840
Or they love cats and they can't stand dogs.

293
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:53,279
Right.

294
00:12:53,559 --> 00:13:00,240
I think it even gets to the point where I've heard that maybe on dates, people will ask, so are you a dog person or a cat person?

295
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:01,679
I know that's how I pick dates.

296
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,360
What about you?

297
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,759
Are you a dog person or a cat person?

298
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm definitely a dog person.

299
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,539
Good answer.

300
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:16,840
Yeah, I think cats are, I mean, they're nice and they're cuddly and I think they're very good indoor pets and a little bit more fun than maybe a hamster.

301
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,259
But I think dogs have more life and are more energetic.

302
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,440
I think cats are very lazy.

303
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,279
And I think sometimes cats like to play mind games.

304
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:28,159
Like they're so smart that they can control you.

305
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,879
That makes me uncomfortable.

306
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:30,659
Yeah, right.

307
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,259
So, well, there are a lot of other pets out there.

308
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,500
Some people have tarantulas, some people have iguanas, other people have fish.

309
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,340
Or horses.

310
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,019
Horses.

311
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,399
If you have enough space, right?

312
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:46,179
So we want to know what kind of pets do you have or did you have as a kid?

313
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:46,919
That's right.

314
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,399
Let us know.

315
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,600
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

316
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,460
We hope to see you there.

317
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:50,840
All right.

318
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,059
Bye.

319
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,379
Bye.
