1
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:07,360
We have been over this a hundred times.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,980
We are not getting a pet.

3
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:10,099
Why not?

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:10,880
Come on!

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,220
Just a cute little puppy.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,099
Or a kitty!

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,759
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

8
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:16,500
I will!

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,940
I'll feed it, bathe it, and walk it every day.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,460
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

11
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,539
What if we want to take a vacation?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,059
Who will we leave it with?

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,699
Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

14
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:32,700
Okay, how about we get a cat or a ferret?

15
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,960
We're planning on having children soon.

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,600
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

17
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,320
Fine, let's get a bird then.

18
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,840
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,659
A parrot would be awesome.

20
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:49,520
I'll tell you what, I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,420
Yay!
