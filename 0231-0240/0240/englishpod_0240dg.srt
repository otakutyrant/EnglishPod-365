1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We have been over this a hundred times.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We are not getting a pet.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Why not?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Come on!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just a cute little puppy.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Or a kitty!

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Who's going to look after a dog or a cat?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I will!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll feed it, bathe it, and walk it every day.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We can get a Labrador or a German Shepherd.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What if we want to take a vacation?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Who will we leave it with?

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Plus, our apartment is too small for that breed of dog.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, how about we get a cat or a ferret?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're planning on having children soon.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Fine, let's get a bird then.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A parrot would be awesome.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll tell you what, I can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yay!
