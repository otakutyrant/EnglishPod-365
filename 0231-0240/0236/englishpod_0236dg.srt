EnglishPod.com When I get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wow, maybe you should get that checked out.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Maybe you're stressed?

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just take some sedatives.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Works for me.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Every so often, having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I heard of that, but does that apply to Alex's situation?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, sure.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why not?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia, since it's a recent thing, so taking melatonin should do the trick.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's easy and curable.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's not something freakish, like if he was a sleepwalker.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, there's that too.
