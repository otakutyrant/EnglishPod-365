EnglishPod.com When I get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,539
Wow, maybe you should get that checked out.

3
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:40,920
Maybe you're stressed?

4
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,899
Just take some sedatives.

5
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:43,799
Works for me.

6
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,520
Every so often, having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

7
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,979
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

8
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,539
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,359
I heard of that, but does that apply to Alex's situation?

10
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,539
Yeah, sure.

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,340
Why not?

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,819
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia, since it's a recent thing, so taking melatonin should do the trick.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,200
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

14
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,719
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

15
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,879
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

16
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,219
It's easy and curable.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,340
It's not something freakish, like if he was a sleepwalker.

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,579
Well, there's that too.
