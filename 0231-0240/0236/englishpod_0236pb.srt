00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,179
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,140
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking a little bit about going to sleep or not being able to sleep.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:12,939
That's right.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:22,199
We are having some sleeping problems, and we're actually going to check out a couple of words related to this topic right now on Vocabulary Preview.

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,079
Vocabulary Preview.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,079
Okay, so the first word is actually the technical word that describes being unable to sleep.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,899
It's called insomnia.

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,020
Right, so if you have insomnia, it means that you can't fall asleep.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,820
You can't sleep.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,299
Okay, so this is a pretty serious condition.

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:48,659
For example, if you have insomnia and you don't sleep for three or four nights, you're not going to do very well at work, right?

13
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:54,200
Right, or if you're studying, you're tired at school, you can't concentrate, so it's a very big problem.

14
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:55,820
What's that other word, though?

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,979
We have insomnia, but we also have another interesting disorder.

16
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:07,980
Right, if somebody is able to sleep but walks while they're sleeping, that person is called a sleepwalker.

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,420
That's right, and you don't actually just have to walk to be a sleepwalker.

18
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:17,640
You can do any number of strange things like basically acting like you're awake when you're not.

19
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:18,560
Exactly.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,200
So some people get up and walk, actually go outside.

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,260
Some people get dressed, some people even go downstairs and cook.

22
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,760
Yeah, that's right, and the worst is the people who eat because they gain weight and they don't know why.

23
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:37,640
Exactly, so sleepwalking is what you do, and if you do this, you're called a sleepwalker.

24
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,260
Okay, sleepwalk is the verb, sleepwalker is the noun or the person.

25
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,739
All right, so we've taken a look at two words that we're going to find in our dialogue today.

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,120
Why don't we go now and listen to the dialogue for the first time?

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,659
Alex, what's up with you?

28
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,120
You look dreadful.

29
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,219
Hey, Jill.

30
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,680
I don't know, I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks.

31
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,900
I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep.

32
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,860
I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed.

33
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,840
I've tried eating and not eating different foods.

34
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:27,800
I've even tried counting sheep, and then when I finally get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,879
Wow, maybe you should get that checked out.

36
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,259
Maybe you're stressed?

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,120
Just take some sedatives, works for me.

38
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,840
Every so often, having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

39
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,300
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

40
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,860
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,680
I heard of that, but does that apply to Alex's situation?

42
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,740
Yeah, sure, why not?

43
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:58,159
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing, so taking melatonin should do the trick.

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,520
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

45
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,020
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,199
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

47
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,520
It's easy and curable.

48
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:10,659
It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,960
Well, there's that, too.

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:26,259
Alright, we're back, so obviously this person not only has insomnia, but also has nightmares, sleep walks, a mess.

51
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:30,879
That's right, and you can tell when someone hasn't been sleeping well.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,919
They have that look, like there's bags under their eyes, or they just look really tired.

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,120
And so, the friend here says, Alex, you look dreadful.

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,879
That's right, dreadful.

55
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,360
So this is an adjective, and it's a way to describe someone that looks terrible.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,759
You look horrible.

57
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:49,840
You look tired.

58
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,659
You look sleepy.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,479
That's right.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,900
So this is not a compliment.

61
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,840
This is something that you say when you're worried about someone.

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,620
So for example, if someone's really, really tired, you say, you look dreadful.

63
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:07,280
Or if someone is wearing very dirty clothes, they don't look like they went home yesterday, you say, what's wrong?

64
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,159
You look dreadful.

65
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,699
Right.

66
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,020
I think you can also use it to describe objects, or maybe food, right?

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,300
This lasagna is dreadful.

68
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,860
It means it's very bad, and you don't want to say that to the person who cooked it, of course.

69
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,579
Exactly.

70
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:25,540
Alright, so the person obviously, because is suffering from insomnia, looks dreadful.

71
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,959
And he was explaining what he does to try to fall asleep.

72
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,180
For example, counting sheep, stretching, and he also said that he tried different breathing techniques.

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,439
Okay, so basically a technique is an approach to something, a kind of method.

74
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:45,540
But in this case, we're talking about breathing techniques.

75
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:52,779
So for some people, one breathing technique is breathing in through your nose and breathing out through your mouth.

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,420
Like that.

77
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
So that's one kind of technique.

78
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,220
So a technique, as you say, is a way of doing something.

79
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,420
So breathing techniques are different ways of breathing.

80
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,420
So maybe you will relax, so maybe you'll fall asleep.

81
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:07,420
Things like this.

82
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:07,920
Exactly.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,819
It's one of those things that you might learn about in a yoga class, for example.

84
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,439
There's different breathing techniques.

85
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,879
Right, and you can combine techniques with other words, as well, adding the I-N-G.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,699
For example, you have walking techniques, maybe, to put less stress on your knees.

87
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,660
Or running techniques, swimming techniques.

88
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,379
I think there's a technique for almost everything.

89
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,480
Just about anything you can do, there's a technique for it, I think.

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,879
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

91
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,779
All right, and well, moving on, he was talking about his nightmares.

92
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,060
And he described his nightmares as disturbing.

93
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,779
He has disturbing nightmares.

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,639
Okay, well, I think this is an important word to cover here, Marco, because we've heard the verb to disturb before.

95
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,399
Like I'm sorry to disturb you, means I'm sorry to bother you.

96
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:56,519
But disturbing is an adjective.

97
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,939
It describes something that makes me very uncomfortable, right?

98
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:00,360
Right.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,959
So, for example, a lot of times in the news, we see very disturbing images, car accidents or fires or bombs.

100
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,439
And what's disturbing is when you see human beings who have been hurt.

101
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,800
So images that make you really uncomfortable or sad, these are disturbing.

102
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,079
So disturbing nightmares are nightmares that are not very pleasant.

103
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,220
They make him scared, maybe, or uncomfortable.

104
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:29,100
Right, like a dream, for example, where your parents die.

105
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,339
It's pretty disturbing.

106
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,139
All right, and well, one of his friends recommended, you know what, stop with all of this.

107
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,779
Just take some sedatives.

108
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,680
Okay, so sedatives are a kind of medicine that help a person relax or that help make a person tired.

109
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,379
Right.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,519
So I think it comes from the verb to sedate.

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,139
Yes.

112
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,379
And basically, that is to calm down, to tranquilize.

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,100
That's right.

114
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,639
So in this case, we're talking about a person, but you can also give an animal sedatives.

115
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:06,680
For example, if you want to take your dog on an airplane, the dog needs to relax, you give it some sedatives.

116
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:07,399
Exactly.

117
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,339
And I think when he mentioned a specific name of a sedative, it's melatonin.

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,139
That's right.

119
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:20,879
So melatonin, melatonin, is a chemical that our bodies naturally produce that help calm us down.

120
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:28,060
And so a lot of pharmaceutical companies or drug companies sell melatonin in a pill form.

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,819
It's basically, it's a chemical that helps you relax.

122
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,980
So obviously, if you take melatonin, you're going to feel sleepy or you're going to be very relaxed and you're going to fall asleep a lot easier.

123
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,540
Well, hopefully.

124
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,240
Hopefully.

125
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:40,279
That's right.

126
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,879
So, and well, the whole thing that we've been talking about, insomnia, sleepwalking, these are called sleeping disorders.

127
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:48,740
Right.

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:48,839
Right.

129
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,740
Or you might also hear the term sleep disorders.

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,220
They mean problems with sleeping.

131
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,420
So people who either cannot fall asleep or people who have bad dreams or people who sleep walk.

132
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,199
Exactly.

133
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,680
So a disorder is something of an illness or a condition that is not normal.

134
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:12,360
So for example, as you said, a sleeping disorder or a sleep disorder, it means that you're not able to sleep properly or normally.

135
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,540
But there are other kinds of disorders, right?

136
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,240
Right.

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,480
I guess many people have heard of eating disorders.

138
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:18,959
Okay.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,779
So that's basically people who do not eat like everyone else.

140
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,319
Exactly.

141
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:24,740
So that's what happens with a disorder.

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,399
All right.

143
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,160
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab.

144
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,639
Now it's time for us to take a look at Fluency Builder.

145
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,519
But before that, why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,620
Alex, what's up with you?

147
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,100
You look dreadful.

148
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,179
Hey, Jill.

149
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,620
I don't know.

150
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,659
I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks.

151
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,899
I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep.

152
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,840
I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed.

153
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,799
I've tried eating and not eating different foods.

154
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,080
I've even tried counting sheep.

155
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,940
And then when I finally get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares.

156
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,759
So I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

157
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,820
Maybe you should get that checked out.

158
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,259
Maybe you're stressed?

159
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,200
Just take some sedatives.

160
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,100
Works for me.

161
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,799
Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

162
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,259
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

163
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,840
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

164
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,059
I heard of that.

165
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,659
But does that apply to Alex's situation?

166
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,879
Yeah, sure.

167
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:30,679
Why not?

168
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:37,139
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing, so taking melatonin should do the trick.

169
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:40,519
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

170
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,019
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

171
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,179
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

172
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,500
It's easy and curable.

173
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,639
It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.

174
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, there's that too.

175
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,259
All right, we're back.

176
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:00,379
So now we have three main phrases for Fluency Builder.

177
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,879
Why don't we start with the first one?

178
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,759
Okay, so you heard in today's dialogue an interesting phrase.

179
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:15,779
I don't know if it exists in other languages, but in English we say when you're trying to fall asleep, there's a good technique to help you do so.

180
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:17,120
You count sheep.

181
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,419
Yeah, I think you see it in cartoons all the time.

182
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:27,120
A person is sleeping and over that cartoon's head is a little cloud and you see sheep jumping over a fence.

183
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:35,100
Yeah, basically there's a fence and you say one, two, three, and the process of counting helps relax a person.

184
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,259
Then you fall asleep.

185
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:36,580
Right.

186
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,679
So counting sheep, I guess you're not literally out in a field counting sheep.

187
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,039
You're just imagining sheep in your head and you're trying to fall asleep.

188
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,539
That's right.

189
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,320
Counting sheep.

190
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,120
All right.

191
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:55,799
Well, one of his friends recommended that maybe he should go to a doctor and Jill said that by saying, maybe you should get that checked out.

192
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:08,379
Okay, so to get something checked out, to get it checked out, this means to have a professional give you a suggestion or to have a professional look at something.

193
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,840
So maybe you should get examined.

194
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,659
Maybe you should go to the doctor.

195
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,539
This isn't just about disorders, right?

196
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,779
I mean, what if I have a sore tooth?

197
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,559
I could say this.

198
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:18,919
Right.

199
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,519
So if you have a toothache, I would recommend, oh, maybe you should get that checked out by my dentist.

200
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,299
Right.

201
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:29,740
Or maybe if you have a bad rash, you know, your skin is very red.

202
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,659
I say, Marco, I think you should get that checked out by a doctor.

203
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,820
So to get something checked, to get something examined by a doctor or a professional.

204
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:41,840
All right.

205
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,600
And the last phrase that we have for you.

206
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,919
So the last phrase we have today comes from a suggestion at the end.

207
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:55,460
The friend suggests taking melatonin and he says, listen, taking melatonin should do the trick.

208
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,080
So if you end a phrase by saying that should do the trick, basically you're saying that should solve your problem.

209
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:04,960
That should help you.

210
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:05,539
Exactly.

211
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,179
So the trick, you don't have to think about what the trick is.

212
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,159
It's just a way of saying it should fix your problem.

213
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:21,480
So for example, when someone is fixing my car and they have one more thing to do and it's finished, he says the car mechanic might say that should do the trick.

214
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:21,919
Right.

215
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:23,480
That means problem solved.

216
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,679
Or maybe you're having, you want to hang a picture on your wall.

217
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,460
So somebody puts a nail in the wall and that should do the trick and maybe that'll hold up the painting.

218
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:33,759
Done.

219
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,299
Done.

220
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:34,919
Okay.

221
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,639
So that's a way of saying that should solve the problem.

222
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,000
This should be the solution.

223
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,379
That should be all.

224
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:41,940
Okay.

225
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,639
Okay.

226
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time.

227
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,960
Alex, what's up with you?

228
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,419
You look dreadful.

229
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,000
Hey Jill, I don't know.

230
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,960
I've been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks.

231
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,220
I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep.

232
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,159
I've tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed.

233
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,120
I've tried eating and not eating different foods.

234
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,399
I've even tried counting sheep.

235
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,320
And then when I finally get to sleep, I have these really disturbing nightmares.

236
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,120
So I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep.

237
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:24,840
Wow.

238
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,139
Maybe you should get that checked out.

239
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:28,539
Maybe you're stressed?

240
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,539
Just take some sedatives.

241
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,399
Works for me.

242
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,139
Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping.

243
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,580
It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders.

244
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,139
It's the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.

245
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,379
I heard of that.

246
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,960
But does that apply to Alex's situation?

247
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah, sure.

248
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,980
Why not?

249
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,480
Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it's a recent thing, so taking melatonin should do the trick.

250
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,840
But shouldn't he be looking into why it's been happening?

251
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,320
Well, aren't you the little psychologist?

252
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:02,500
Our buddy's having trouble sleeping.

253
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,820
It's easy and curable.

254
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,960
It's not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.

255
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,240
Well, there's that too.

256
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,879
All right, we're back.

257
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,759
So talking about dreaming, nightmares, insomnia, all of this, what do you do if you can't fall asleep?

258
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:28,340
I don't really have this problem personally because I could fall asleep anywhere, anytime.

259
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,580
I've heard some people take warm milk before going to sleep.

260
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:33,600
Yes, some people take milk.

261
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,799
Although I also heard that dairy products before bedtime can make you have nightmares.

262
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,440
Oh, really?

263
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,500
Like if you eat cheese before bed.

264
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,419
I've heard that as well.

265
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,480
I've heard that if you have seafood before bed, you'll have nightmares as well.

266
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:53,379
But actually, have you ever had a dream when you are doing something and you wake up in the middle of that?

267
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:54,840
Yes.

268
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:05,559
I remember once I was dreaming, I was drinking a soda and all of a sudden I woke up and I had my hand in the air doing the action of me actually drinking the soda.

269
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:08,340
Actually, sometimes this happens to me when I'm falling asleep.

270
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,659
I imagine I'm on a bike or something and I start to feel myself moving my legs and I wake up and I'm like, wait, wait, what am I doing?

271
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,899
So the brain is very strained, I think, especially in those times when you're kind of asleep and you're kind of awake.

272
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,659
Also when you wake up suddenly, I don't know if other people have experienced this, but you feel like you're falling or something.

273
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:32,059
Obviously, you just wake up with a shake.

274
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,320
Yeah, your body moves.

275
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,179
Yeah, it's very scary.

276
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Your heart starts to beat.

277
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,500
I don't know why that happens.

278
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,179
It's unusual.

279
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:41,720
Well, we're curious to know what your sleep habits are.

280
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,419
Do you have a hard time sleeping or are you like me?

281
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:45,840
It's very easy for you to fall asleep.

282
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,960
Let us know at our website, EnglishPod.com.

283
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:48,940
All right, we'll see you guys there.

284
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,240
Bye.
