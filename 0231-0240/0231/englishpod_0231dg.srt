EnglishPod.com Hi, excuse me, sir.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
They don't provide any support anymore.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Show me some classic high heels, please.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, right this way.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What color did you have in mind?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Black, classic.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Of course, we've got this style here that is very popular.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They look great on everyone.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Um, too shiny.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't like the pointed toes.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let me take a look at what else you have.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Too high.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't want bows.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Those might as well be stilettos.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Too modern.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Ah, finally, this is what I'm looking for.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What size?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Seven and a half.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here we are.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How does it fit?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mmm, not good.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They're too tight.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You know what?

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll come back another time.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Have a nice day, ma'am.
