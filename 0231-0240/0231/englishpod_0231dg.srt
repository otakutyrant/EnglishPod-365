EnglishPod.com Hi, excuse me, sir.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,980
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,220
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,259
They don't provide any support anymore.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,280
Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for?

6
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:23,480
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

7
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,640
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,920
Show me some classic high heels, please.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,439
Okay, right this way.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,460
What color did you have in mind?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,899
Black, classic.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,840
Of course, we've got this style here that is very popular.

13
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:44,640
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:46,280
They look great on everyone.

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,619
Um, too shiny.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,399
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

17
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:58,179
Okay, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,340
I don't like the pointed toes.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,560
Let me take a look at what else you have.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,920
Too high.

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,439
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,739
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

23
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,799
I don't want bows.

24
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,680
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

25
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,760
Those might as well be stilettos.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,859
Too modern.

27
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:25,379
Ah, finally, this is what I'm looking for.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,299
What size?

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,400
Seven and a half.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,120
Here we are.

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,719
How does it fit?

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,579
Mmm, not good.

33
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,620
They're too tight.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,159
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

35
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,000
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

36
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,920
You know what?

37
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,920
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

38
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,099
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

39
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,680
I'll come back another time.

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,840
Have a nice day, ma'am.
