00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,820
My name is Katherine, and we're shoe shopping again.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:09,679
That's right.

5
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:15,720
We are going shoe shopping, but this time it's a little bit more complicated because we're getting women's shoes.

6
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:16,500
That's right.

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:19,199
So there are so many different kinds of women's shoes.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,719
I'm not even sure I know them all myself, but in this intermediate level lesson, we're going to cover some of the basics for you.

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,339
That's right.

10
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:33,880
All right, so before we jump into this dialogue, we have a word that we want to preview with you today, and let's take a look at it now on Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,820
Okay, so we're shopping today for a certain kind of shoe.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,000
It's not a sports shoe.

13
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,399
It's a dress shoe.

14
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:47,119
Okay, that kind of doesn't make sense because a dress is a noun.

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,060
A shoe is a noun, and so you want to get a shoe that's a dress?

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:52,539
No.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,960
A dress shoe is a style of shoe.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,780
It means shoes that you wear when you're wearing fancy clothes.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,759
So it's kind of like a formal shoe.

20
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:05,280
A dress shoe is for a type of shoe that would go well with a dress.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:05,920
That's right.

22
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,040
Not sneakers.

23
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,560
But don't be fooled.

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,780
This is not about dresses because men can wear dress shoes too.

25
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:12,319
That's right.

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,579
It means shoes you would wear to a conference or to a wedding or to church.

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,680
So these are things that are a little bit fancier than everyday shoes.

28
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,299
Okay.

29
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,079
Awesome.

30
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:33,140
So we're shopping for a dress shoe, and there are so many types and styles of shoes for women, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a second.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,900
Hi, excuse me, sir.

32
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,560
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,780
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

34
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,760
They don't provide any support anymore.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,599
Sure.

36
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,840
What kind of shoe are you looking for?

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,040
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,219
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,480
Show me some classic high heels, please.

40
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,140
Okay.

41
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:06,000
Right this way.

42
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,020
What color did you have in mind?

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:09,719
Black.

44
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,439
Classic.

45
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,419
Of course.

46
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,400
We've got this style here that is very popular.

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,199
Because it's an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

48
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,840
They look great on everyone.

49
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,159
Um, too shiny.

50
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,000
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed-toe shoe.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:26,919
Okay.

52
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,719
These are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

53
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,819
I don't like the pointed toes.

54
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,020
Let me take a look at what else you have.

55
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,479
Too high.

56
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,960
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

57
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,280
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

58
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,360
I don't want bows.

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,280
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

60
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,340
Those might as well be stilettos.

61
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:56,419
Too modern.

62
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,659
Ah, finally!

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,919
This is what I'm looking for.

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,879
What size?

65
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:00,979
Seven and a half.

66
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,240
Here we are.

67
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,280
How does it fit?

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,139
Not good.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,180
They're too tight.

70
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,580
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow, and it's pinching my toes, and there'd be no room for my insoles.

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,460
You know what?

72
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,479
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

73
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,659
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

74
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,439
I'll come back another time.

75
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,300
Have a nice day, ma'am.

76
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,360
All right, we're back.

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,960
So a lot of shoe styles, as you noticed, a lot of them are very, I don't know, I don't even know what they are.

78
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,379
So why don't we try and explain them now on Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,340
Language Takeaway.

80
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:55,020
So the first kind of shoe we've got here is very popular in the summer.

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,960
It's called a strappy sandal.

82
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,259
Strappy sandal.

83
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,120
So we know what a sandal is.

84
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,860
It's kind of like what you wear to the beach.

85
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,039
It's a shoe that it doesn't really cover your whole foot, just the bottom.

86
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:06,740
It's very open.

87
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,120
And well, what about strappy?

88
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,240
Strappy comes from the word strap.

89
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,240
So a strap is like a thin piece of fabric or leather that connects other pieces.

90
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:24,759
And so a strappy sandal means that it's got many of these different little straps on it, many lines everywhere that connect it.

91
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:25,720
So it's very open.

92
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,160
It's made of many different thin pieces.

93
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,139
Okay, good.

94
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,220
So we have a strappy sandal, basically a sandal with many straps.

95
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,680
And well, she went on to describe a sleek high heel.

96
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,639
So this is a two-part thing here.

97
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,019
Sleek is an adjective, which basically means really cool looking.

98
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,500
Or more like it's pretty and fancy.

99
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,420
Usually sleek things are also kind of simple, like a Jaguar's very sleek car.

100
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,240
And so this is the adjective to describe the high heels.

101
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,139
So we have high heels.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,220
Okay, we have high heels that are kind of fancy shoe.

103
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,180
Basically these are shoes that are not flat.

104
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,079
So the heel is very tall.

105
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,860
That's right.

106
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:16,959
So basically this is what a lot of women wear with dresses.

107
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,959
Basically the heel has a piece that kind of sticks out and makes the woman look taller.

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,060
So basically it's like they're walking on the tips of their toes the entire time.

109
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:26,399
Right.

110
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,899
And they make click, cluck, click, cluck.

111
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:28,220
Exactly.

112
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,879
They make that sound.

113
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,519
But there are different kinds of heels.

114
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,180
Okay.

115
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,540
High heels obviously means that they're tall.

116
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,980
You can have low heels too.

117
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,720
Those are shorter.

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,560
But high heels, there are different kinds.

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
One kind is pumps.

120
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:40,660
Pumps.

121
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,019
Okay.

122
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,500
In the dialogue, we actually saw the salesman describe them as edgy pumps.

123
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,220
So edgy, what does edgy mean?

124
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,279
Edgy means cool or hip.

125
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:53,500
So young people like to wear edgy clothes, like rock and roll kind of clothes.

126
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,620
Not so much older people.

127
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,860
And pumps are a type of high heel, you say, but what is the difference?

128
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,160
Well, pumps basically are the kind of simple heel that a woman will wear with a pantsuit or with a skirt to the office.

129
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,420
And so they usually have a closed toe and they're quite simple heels.

130
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,019
Okay.

131
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:20,180
And the opposite or, well, maybe a little bit different from pumps would be stilettos.

132
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,220
So stilettos are a very special kind of heel, stiletto.

133
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,139
It refers basically to the difference in the back of the shoe where you have the heel.

134
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,620
Because sometimes heels are kind of thick and heavy and they make the clunk, clunk sound.

135
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,920
But stilettos are very, very, very thin and very, very tall.

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:39,720
Okay.

137
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,199
So stiletto heels.

138
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,240
I think it's probably easier to walk with pumps rather than stilettos, right?

139
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,000
Stilettos are famous for being very, very hard to walk in.

140
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,680
It's almost like the back of your heel is a chopstick.

141
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,279
Wow.

142
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,379
I cannot imagine doing that.

143
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:56,579
All right.

144
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,620
So this is the classification of our high heels.

145
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,040
Why don't we move on now to Mary Janes?

146
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:03,699
Okay.

147
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,339
So we've got high heels and heels.

148
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,660
We also have flats.

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,300
These are flat shoes.

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,279
So one important kind of flats is a Mary Jane.

151
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,339
Sounds like a name.

152
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,480
It is a name, right?

153
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,160
Mary Jane.

154
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:16,839
Mary Jane.

155
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
So what type of shoe is this?

156
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,399
This is basically a, usually a leather shoe, but it can be different materials.

157
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,899
And it's round in the front and it has one strap and they're very cute.

158
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:29,959
Okay.

159
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,379
Okay.

160
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,920
Usually little girls wear Mary Janes, but they're pretty popular these days with older people too.

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,620
Okay.

162
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:34,920
Okay.

163
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,120
So they're round in the front.

164
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,139
They are usually black and they have one little strap that goes over the top of your foot.

165
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,560
Mary Janes.

166
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:43,899
Okay.

167
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,060
All right.

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,899
So we've taken a look at Mary Janes.

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,980
Now moving on to, I think it's a similar type of shoe, ballerina shoes.

170
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,339
Well, ballerina shoes are similar because they're flat, but that's about it.

171
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,019
Ballerina shoes are very, very thin.

172
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,980
They're very, very weak.

173
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,220
And usually they're pretty simple.

174
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,899
They're pink or white or black and they're almost like a slipper.

175
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:08,540
Okay.

176
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,139
So they don't have the strap on top.

177
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,720
No, they're stretchy and you just slide them onto your foot.

178
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:22,279
It's named after a dancers, ballerinas, you know, the dancers who wear pink and they put their hair up and they spin around and they're not hard on the bottom.

179
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:24,339
They're usually quite soft and they're always flat.

180
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,860
So maybe these ballerina shoes, they're not the specific types of shoes for dancing if you're a ballerina.

181
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:36,399
But maybe they're more adequate for maybe walking around the house or something.

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,960
You don't really go out hiking with ballerina shoes.

183
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,980
No, you don't go out hiking, but they're very popular to wear now to school or work.

184
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,940
And the other type of shoes that we had, actually, this was really confusing to me, slingbacks, slingback shoes.

185
00:08:52,580 --> 00:09:00,220
Well, slingbacks can be hard because they can be heels, they could be pumps, but it basically refers to a part of the shoe.

186
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,039
So normal shoes, they cover the back of your foot, but slingbacks have one strap in the back.

187
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,019
So maybe if I look at my foot in a slingback, I can see part of my heel.

188
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,279
Okay.

189
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,179
So slingbacks have a little strap on the back of your heel since the shoe doesn't close in the back.

190
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:17,799
Right.

191
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:18,539
Okay.

192
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:26,779
But you also have high heels and women's shoes that don't close in the back, but that you don't have a strap in the back either, right?

193
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,080
Those are open shoes.

194
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,519
So yeah, they're open in the back, but the slingback, there's one strap that keeps your shoe on.

195
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

196
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,279
A lot of different types of shoes we've just taken a look at.

197
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,559
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.

198
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,940
Hi, excuse me, sir.

199
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,580
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

200
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,840
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

201
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,799
They don't provide any support anymore.

202
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:55,720
Sure.

203
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,879
What kind of shoe are you looking for?

204
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:03,059
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

205
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,139
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

206
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,500
Show me some classic high heels, please.

207
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,200
Okay.

208
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,039
Right this way.

209
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,899
What color did you have in mind?

210
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:14,639
Black.

211
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,320
Classic.

212
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,279
Of course.

213
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,279
We've got this style here that is very popular.

214
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,080
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,740
They look great on everyone.

216
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,059
Um, too shiny.

217
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,860
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

218
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:31,700
Okay.

219
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,539
These are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

220
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:38,659
I don't like the pointed toes.

221
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,879
Let me take a look at what else you have.

222
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,279
Too high.

223
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,799
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,100
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

225
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,639
I don't want bows.

226
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,820
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

227
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,840
Those might as well be stilettos.

228
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:54,779
Too modern.

229
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,059
Ah, finally!

230
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,299
This is what I'm looking for.

231
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,279
What size?

232
00:10:58,779 --> 00:10:59,379
Seven and a half.

233
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,759
Here we are.

234
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,740
How does it fit?

235
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,600
Mmm, not good.

236
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,639
They're too tight.

237
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,139
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

238
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

239
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:11,940
You know what?

240
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,919
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

241
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,700
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

242
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,200
I'll come back another time.

243
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,440
Have a nice day, ma'am.

244
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,659
All right, we're back.

245
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,639
So now let's take a look at five key things on Fluency Builder.

246
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:41,960
Okay, well the reason we're shopping today is because the woman needs a new pair of shoes because her old shoes can't be worn anymore.

247
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,879
What's wrong with them, Marco?

248
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,179
She said that they were stretched out of shape.

249
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:58,840
Okay, so to stretch or to be stretched out, this means that maybe they've been pulled and worn and they're stretched so much that they don't have the original shape anymore.

250
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:08,820
Right, so just imagine you have a new t-shirt and all of a sudden somebody takes you from your t-shirt and pulls you really hard.

251
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,240
And usually what happens is this t-shirt is going to be stretched out of shape.

252
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,840
You pulled it so hard that it loses its original form.

253
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,399
So now maybe the neck is very low or the t-shirt is too long on one side.

254
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,500
So that's what happens when you stretch something out of shape.

255
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:25,820
Okay.

256
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,620
So her old shoes are stretched out of shape and they don't provide support anymore.

257
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,679
Okay, so to provide support.

258
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,779
Now what kind of support is she referring to?

259
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,320
She's talking about foot support.

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,240
So for example, slippers are a kind of shoe basically that don't provide support.

261
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,080
They're very soft.

262
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,399
But can you walk around all day in slippers?

263
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,820
No, that doesn't help your foot.

264
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:54,259
But if you're trying to find shoes that are really good for walking, you need to find ones that provide support.

265
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,940
That means that always support your foot, the bottom of your foot, otherwise your foot gets too tired.

266
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
Not only the bottom, but it could be also your ankle.

267
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:12,379
For example, you can't really go hiking with shoes like these with sandals because obviously you're walking around rocks and it doesn't provide support on your ankle.

268
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,159
Maybe you can hurt your ankle if you don't have it.

269
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,759
So maybe a hiking boot will provide more support.

270
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:17,480
Exactly.

271
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:26,320
All right, and then the woman also mentioned that it's hard for her to find a shoe because she said, I have a high instep.

272
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,539
Okay, so think about the foot.

273
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:34,360
You've got toes in the very front and a heel in the very back, but in the middle on top you have the instep.

274
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,539
So this is basically the top of your foot.

275
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,460
Okay, so if she has a high instep, it means that her foot is kind of thick.

276
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:41,279
That's right.

277
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,299
Some people have thin feet.

278
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,559
She has kind of a thick foot.

279
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,080
So fitting her foot into a shoe is sometimes hard.

280
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Right, we're not talking about the width of the foot.

281
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,639
We're talking about the height.

282
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,379
Like how tall.

283
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,419
How tall it is.

284
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,759
From the bottom to the top of the foot.

285
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,320
Right, so that's what she means by high instep.

286
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,240
And well, they also mentioned different types of shoes.

287
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,419
She said she didn't want an open toe shoe.

288
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,220
She wanted a closed toe shoe.

289
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:05,779
That's right.

290
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,019
So this is a really important classification for women's shoes especially.

291
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:18,799
Open toe means that the toe of the shoe, the very, very front, has a hole or an opening so you can see the toes.

292
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,159
Closed toe is the opposite.

293
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:27,519
So personally in the wintertime I always wear closed toed shoes because I think open toe shoes are too cold.

294
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,480
Too cold, okay.

295
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:34,059
So that's basically, I guess men, we don't really have this type of shoe between open toe and closed toe.

296
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,279
No, maybe, no you don't really.

297
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:42,039
But heels maybe, you could have an open toe, you can have an open toe shoe or a closed toed shoe.

298
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,639
Right, right.

299
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,019
Okay.

300
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:44,940
So a lot of interesting things.

301
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,159
This is useful for women out there and also for boyfriends.

302
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,580
Maybe now you know what type of shoe your girlfriend may want.

303
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,639
That's right.

304
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,179
All right, so let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back shortly.

305
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,820
Hi, excuse me sir.

306
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,460
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

307
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,720
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

308
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,720
They don't provide any support anymore.

309
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,759
Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for?

310
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:19,960
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

311
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,120
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

312
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,419
Show me some classic high heels please.

313
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,940
Okay, right this way.

314
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,919
What color did you have in mind?

315
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,399
Black, classic.

316
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,340
Of course.

317
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,320
We've got this style here that is very popular.

318
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,120
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

319
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,759
They look great on everyone.

320
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Too shiny.

321
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,899
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

322
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,639
Okay, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

323
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,820
I don't like the pointed toes.

324
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:58,980
Let me take a look at what else you have.

325
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,399
Too high.

326
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,919
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

327
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,240
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

328
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,279
I don't want bows.

329
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:14,179
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

330
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,259
Those might as well be stilettos.

331
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:19,320
Too modern.

332
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,580
Ah, finally!

333
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,840
This is what I'm looking for.

334
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:22,759
What size?

335
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:23,899
Seven and a half.

336
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:28,419
Here we are!

337
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,220
How does it fit?

338
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,059
Not good.

339
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,100
They're too tight.

340
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,620
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

341
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,500
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

342
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,419
You know what?

343
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,399
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

344
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,600
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

345
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,340
I'll come back another time.

346
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,379
Have a nice day, ma'am.

347
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:09,559
All right, so talking about shoes, there's so many types and I think women are notoriously famous for having a lot of shoes.

348
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,480
Why is this?

349
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,519
Some women are.

350
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,339
Some women aren't.

351
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,359
It depends on the person.

352
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:23,089
But part of the problem, as you said earlier, is that there's so many different kinds of women's shoes that now we expect women to have a different pair of shoes for every different occasion.

353
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,289
Work shoes, hiking shoes, running shoes, wedding shoes.

354
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,170
I don't know.

355
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,289
Summer shoes, winter shoes, fall shoes.

356
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,089
So you need so many different kinds of shoes, you end up buying many different kinds.

357
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:36,390
I think that that's true.

358
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:39,029
And also, basically, women like to look nice.

359
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:44,309
So that's why, you know, you do your makeup, you have earrings, and they have nice bags.

360
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:51,230
So I guess it's also part of it is that you pay more attention to what type of shoe you're wearing that maybe goes well with the outfit.

361
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,250
I think maybe guys, not all guys, obviously, as well as not all women, but guys are a little bit more generic.

362
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:02,730
Because like jeans pretty much go well with any type of shoe as long as it's maybe black or brown, right, or something like this.

363
00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:05,910
Although I know a lot of guys who have many different kinds of shoes.

364
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:06,589
True, true.

365
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:09,509
It takes up a lot of space in the closet as well.

366
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:09,970
It does.

367
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,309
Shoes are hard to carry around.

368
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,809
And actually, I find it kind of hard to get rid of my shoes.

369
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:22,170
I think they have to be ripped or just completely unwearable in order for me to throw a shoe away.

370
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:25,349
Because otherwise, you know, you can still wear it sometimes on the weekends.

371
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:26,009
That's true.

372
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,750
Although I tend to wear my shoes down.

373
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:30,230
That means I wear them until they die.

374
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,869
Really?

375
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,009
And then I throw them away.

376
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,289
I've had shoes that I've worn the soles down, and then I just get the sole changed because I like the shoe so much.

377
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:41,130
Well, let us know.

378
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,990
Do you guys like to buy shoes?

379
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,410
Do you have a lot of shoes?

380
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:45,890
Maybe you don't have that many shoes.

381
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,369
We're curious to know about this in other cultures as well.

382
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,569
Because I know in the United States, shoe shopping is very, very popular.

383
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,970
In Holland, they have traditional wooden shoes.

384
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:56,789
Yeah, they do.

385
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:57,789
Those are called clogs.

386
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:58,410
Clogs.

387
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,849
So let us know maybe what type of shoes are also very unique to your country or culture.

388
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,470
We're at EnglishPod.com.

389
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:05,210
We'll see everyone there.

390
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:05,609
Bye.

391
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:05,990
Bye.
