00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Katherine, and we're shoe shopping again.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are going shoe shopping, but this time it's a little bit more complicated because we're getting women's shoes.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So there are so many different kinds of women's shoes.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not even sure I know them all myself, but in this intermediate level lesson, we're going to cover some of the basics for you.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
All right, so before we jump into this dialogue, we have a word that we want to preview with you today, and let's take a look at it now on Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, so we're shopping today for a certain kind of shoe.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's not a sports shoe.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's a dress shoe.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, that kind of doesn't make sense because a dress is a noun.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A shoe is a noun, and so you want to get a shoe that's a dress?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A dress shoe is a style of shoe.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It means shoes that you wear when you're wearing fancy clothes.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So it's kind of like a formal shoe.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A dress shoe is for a type of shoe that would go well with a dress.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's right.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Not sneakers.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But don't be fooled.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is not about dresses because men can wear dress shoes too.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It means shoes you would wear to a conference or to a wedding or to church.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So these are things that are a little bit fancier than everyday shoes.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Awesome.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So we're shopping for a dress shoe, and there are so many types and styles of shoes for women, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a second.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hi, excuse me, sir.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They don't provide any support anymore.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Sure.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What kind of shoe are you looking for?

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Show me some classic high heels, please.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Right this way.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What color did you have in mind?

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Black.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Classic.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Of course.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We've got this style here that is very popular.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Because it's an open-toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They look great on everyone.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Um, too shiny.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed-toe shoe.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
These are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two-inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't like the pointed toes.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let me take a look at what else you have.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Too high.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't want bows.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Those might as well be stilettos.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Too modern.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ah, finally!

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is what I'm looking for.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What size?

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Seven and a half.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Here we are.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How does it fit?

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not good.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They're too tight.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow, and it's pinching my toes, and there'd be no room for my insoles.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You know what?

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll come back another time.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Have a nice day, ma'am.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All right, we're back.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So a lot of shoe styles, as you noticed, a lot of them are very, I don't know, I don't even know what they are.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So why don't we try and explain them now on Language Takeaway.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Language Takeaway.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So the first kind of shoe we've got here is very popular in the summer.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's called a strappy sandal.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Strappy sandal.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So we know what a sandal is.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's kind of like what you wear to the beach.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a shoe that it doesn't really cover your whole foot, just the bottom.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's very open.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And well, what about strappy?

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Strappy comes from the word strap.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So a strap is like a thin piece of fabric or leather that connects other pieces.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And so a strappy sandal means that it's got many of these different little straps on it, many lines everywhere that connect it.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So it's very open.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's made of many different thin pieces.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, good.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So we have a strappy sandal, basically a sandal with many straps.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And well, she went on to describe a sleek high heel.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So this is a two-part thing here.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Sleek is an adjective, which basically means really cool looking.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Or more like it's pretty and fancy.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Usually sleek things are also kind of simple, like a Jaguar's very sleek car.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so this is the adjective to describe the high heels.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So we have high heels.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, we have high heels that are kind of fancy shoe.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Basically these are shoes that are not flat.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So the heel is very tall.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So basically this is what a lot of women wear with dresses.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Basically the heel has a piece that kind of sticks out and makes the woman look taller.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So basically it's like they're walking on the tips of their toes the entire time.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And they make click, cluck, click, cluck.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Exactly.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They make that sound.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But there are different kinds of heels.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
High heels obviously means that they're tall.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You can have low heels too.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Those are shorter.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But high heels, there are different kinds.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
One kind is pumps.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Pumps.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In the dialogue, we actually saw the salesman describe them as edgy pumps.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So edgy, what does edgy mean?

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Edgy means cool or hip.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So young people like to wear edgy clothes, like rock and roll kind of clothes.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Not so much older people.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And pumps are a type of high heel, you say, but what is the difference?

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, pumps basically are the kind of simple heel that a woman will wear with a pantsuit or with a skirt to the office.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And so they usually have a closed toe and they're quite simple heels.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And the opposite or, well, maybe a little bit different from pumps would be stilettos.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So stilettos are a very special kind of heel, stiletto.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It refers basically to the difference in the back of the shoe where you have the heel.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because sometimes heels are kind of thick and heavy and they make the clunk, clunk sound.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But stilettos are very, very, very thin and very, very tall.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So stiletto heels.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I think it's probably easier to walk with pumps rather than stilettos, right?

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Stilettos are famous for being very, very hard to walk in.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's almost like the back of your heel is a chopstick.

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wow.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I cannot imagine doing that.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
All right.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So this is the classification of our high heels.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why don't we move on now to Mary Janes?

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Okay.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So we've got high heels and heels.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We also have flats.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
These are flat shoes.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So one important kind of flats is a Mary Jane.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sounds like a name.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It is a name, right?

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mary Jane.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mary Jane.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So what type of shoe is this?

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is basically a, usually a leather shoe, but it can be different materials.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And it's round in the front and it has one strap and they're very cute.

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Usually little girls wear Mary Janes, but they're pretty popular these days with older people too.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So they're round in the front.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They are usually black and they have one little strap that goes over the top of your foot.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Mary Janes.

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
All right.

168
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we've taken a look at Mary Janes.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now moving on to, I think it's a similar type of shoe, ballerina shoes.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, ballerina shoes are similar because they're flat, but that's about it.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ballerina shoes are very, very thin.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
They're very, very weak.

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And usually they're pretty simple.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They're pink or white or black and they're almost like a slipper.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So they don't have the strap on top.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, they're stretchy and you just slide them onto your foot.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's named after a dancers, ballerinas, you know, the dancers who wear pink and they put their hair up and they spin around and they're not hard on the bottom.

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They're usually quite soft and they're always flat.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So maybe these ballerina shoes, they're not the specific types of shoes for dancing if you're a ballerina.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But maybe they're more adequate for maybe walking around the house or something.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You don't really go out hiking with ballerina shoes.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
No, you don't go out hiking, but they're very popular to wear now to school or work.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And the other type of shoes that we had, actually, this was really confusing to me, slingbacks, slingback shoes.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, slingbacks can be hard because they can be heels, they could be pumps, but it basically refers to a part of the shoe.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So normal shoes, they cover the back of your foot, but slingbacks have one strap in the back.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So maybe if I look at my foot in a slingback, I can see part of my heel.

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So slingbacks have a little strap on the back of your heel since the shoe doesn't close in the back.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But you also have high heels and women's shoes that don't close in the back, but that you don't have a strap in the back either, right?

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Those are open shoes.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So yeah, they're open in the back, but the slingback, there's one strap that keeps your shoe on.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A lot of different types of shoes we've just taken a look at.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back shortly with Fluency Builder.

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hi, excuse me, sir.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They don't provide any support anymore.

202
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Sure.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What kind of shoe are you looking for?

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Show me some classic high heels, please.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Right this way.

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What color did you have in mind?

210
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Black.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Classic.

212
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Of course.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We've got this style here that is very popular.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They look great on everyone.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Um, too shiny.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
These are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't like the pointed toes.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let me take a look at what else you have.

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Too high.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

224
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't want bows.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Those might as well be stilettos.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Too modern.

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ah, finally!

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is what I'm looking for.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What size?

232
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Seven and a half.

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Here we are.

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How does it fit?

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Mmm, not good.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They're too tight.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You know what?

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll come back another time.

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Have a nice day, ma'am.

244
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
All right, we're back.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So now let's take a look at five key things on Fluency Builder.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, well the reason we're shopping today is because the woman needs a new pair of shoes because her old shoes can't be worn anymore.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What's wrong with them, Marco?

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
She said that they were stretched out of shape.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay, so to stretch or to be stretched out, this means that maybe they've been pulled and worn and they're stretched so much that they don't have the original shape anymore.

250
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right, so just imagine you have a new t-shirt and all of a sudden somebody takes you from your t-shirt and pulls you really hard.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And usually what happens is this t-shirt is going to be stretched out of shape.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You pulled it so hard that it loses its original form.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So now maybe the neck is very low or the t-shirt is too long on one side.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So that's what happens when you stretch something out of shape.

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay.

256
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So her old shoes are stretched out of shape and they don't provide support anymore.

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Okay, so to provide support.

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now what kind of support is she referring to?

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
She's talking about foot support.

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So for example, slippers are a kind of shoe basically that don't provide support.

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
They're very soft.

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But can you walk around all day in slippers?

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No, that doesn't help your foot.

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But if you're trying to find shoes that are really good for walking, you need to find ones that provide support.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That means that always support your foot, the bottom of your foot, otherwise your foot gets too tired.

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Not only the bottom, but it could be also your ankle.

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:12,000
For example, you can't really go hiking with shoes like these with sandals because obviously you're walking around rocks and it doesn't provide support on your ankle.

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Maybe you can hurt your ankle if you don't have it.

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So maybe a hiking boot will provide more support.

270
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Exactly.

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All right, and then the woman also mentioned that it's hard for her to find a shoe because she said, I have a high instep.

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay, so think about the foot.

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You've got toes in the very front and a heel in the very back, but in the middle on top you have the instep.

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So this is basically the top of your foot.

275
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Okay, so if she has a high instep, it means that her foot is kind of thick.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's right.

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Some people have thin feet.

278
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
She has kind of a thick foot.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So fitting her foot into a shoe is sometimes hard.

280
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Right, we're not talking about the width of the foot.

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We're talking about the height.

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Like how tall.

283
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How tall it is.

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
From the bottom to the top of the foot.

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Right, so that's what she means by high instep.

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And well, they also mentioned different types of shoes.

287
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
She said she didn't want an open toe shoe.

288
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She wanted a closed toe shoe.

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So this is a really important classification for women's shoes especially.

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Open toe means that the toe of the shoe, the very, very front, has a hole or an opening so you can see the toes.

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Closed toe is the opposite.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So personally in the wintertime I always wear closed toed shoes because I think open toe shoes are too cold.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Too cold, okay.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So that's basically, I guess men, we don't really have this type of shoe between open toe and closed toe.

296
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, maybe, no you don't really.

297
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But heels maybe, you could have an open toe, you can have an open toe shoe or a closed toed shoe.

298
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Right, right.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So a lot of interesting things.

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This is useful for women out there and also for boyfriends.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Maybe now you know what type of shoe your girlfriend may want.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's right.

304
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
All right, so let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back shortly.

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Hi, excuse me sir.

306
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm looking for a dress shoe.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
My usual pair that I've had for years have finally been stretched out of shape.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
They don't provide any support anymore.

309
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sure, what kind of shoe are you looking for?

310
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We've got strappy sandals, sleek high heels, edgy pumps.

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you're looking for something a little more practical, we've got Mary Janes, ballerinas.

312
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Show me some classic high heels please.

313
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay, right this way.

314
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What color did you have in mind?

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Black, classic.

316
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Of course.

317
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We've got this style here that is very popular.

318
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Because it's an open toe shoe, you can wear it any time of the year.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
They look great on everyone.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Too shiny.

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And I wear pantyhose with my shoes, so let's look for a closed toe shoe.

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Okay, these are a very nice pair of leather shoes with a two inch heel, so they are very comfortable.

323
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I don't like the pointed toes.

324
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Let me take a look at what else you have.

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Too high.

326
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That one looks like the back would cut into my heel.

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have a high instep, so I doubt that one would fit properly.

328
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't want bows.

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I find slingbacks very uncomfortable.

330
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Those might as well be stilettos.

331
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Too modern.

332
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Ah, finally!

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This is what I'm looking for.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What size?

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Seven and a half.

336
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Here we are!

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How does it fit?

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Not good.

339
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
They're too tight.

340
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The length is right, but the shoe is too narrow and it's pinching my toes.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And there'd be no room for my insoles.

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know what?

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't think I have the patience for this today.

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
They just don't make shoes like they used to.

345
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll come back another time.

346
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Have a nice day, ma'am.

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
All right, so talking about shoes, there's so many types and I think women are notoriously famous for having a lot of shoes.

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why is this?

349
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Some women are.

350
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Some women aren't.

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It depends on the person.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But part of the problem, as you said earlier, is that there's so many different kinds of women's shoes that now we expect women to have a different pair of shoes for every different occasion.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Work shoes, hiking shoes, running shoes, wedding shoes.

354
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Summer shoes, winter shoes, fall shoes.

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So you need so many different kinds of shoes, you end up buying many different kinds.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think that that's true.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And also, basically, women like to look nice.

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So that's why, you know, you do your makeup, you have earrings, and they have nice bags.

360
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So I guess it's also part of it is that you pay more attention to what type of shoe you're wearing that maybe goes well with the outfit.

361
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I think maybe guys, not all guys, obviously, as well as not all women, but guys are a little bit more generic.

362
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Because like jeans pretty much go well with any type of shoe as long as it's maybe black or brown, right, or something like this.

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Although I know a lot of guys who have many different kinds of shoes.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,000
True, true.

365
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It takes up a lot of space in the closet as well.

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It does.

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Shoes are hard to carry around.

368
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And actually, I find it kind of hard to get rid of my shoes.

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think they have to be ripped or just completely unwearable in order for me to throw a shoe away.

370
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Because otherwise, you know, you can still wear it sometimes on the weekends.

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's true.

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Although I tend to wear my shoes down.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That means I wear them until they die.

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Really?

375
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And then I throw them away.

376
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I've had shoes that I've worn the soles down, and then I just get the sole changed because I like the shoe so much.

377
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, let us know.

378
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you guys like to buy shoes?

379
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Do you have a lot of shoes?

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Maybe you don't have that many shoes.

381
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We're curious to know about this in other cultures as well.

382
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Because I know in the United States, shoe shopping is very, very popular.

383
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
In Holland, they have traditional wooden shoes.

384
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, they do.

385
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Those are called clogs.

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Clogs.

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So let us know maybe what type of shoes are also very unique to your country or culture.

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We're at EnglishPod.com.

389
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We'll see everyone there.

390
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Bye.

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Bye.
