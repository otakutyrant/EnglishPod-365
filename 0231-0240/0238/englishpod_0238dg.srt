EnglishPod.com Now, Miss Child's passed on your resume to me and I've had a chance to look it over.

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,859
I must say, I'm quite impressed.

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,160
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,120
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,859
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:24,320
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

7
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,059
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

8
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:28,120
Yes, of course.

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:37,740
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

10
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,679
Ah, I see.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,899
So you were actually educated in Europe.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,020
Yes, precisely.

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,799
Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

14
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,960
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,840
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Very interesting.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,039
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

18
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:02,859
Absolutely.

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,079
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,140
I see.

21
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,319
Okay, well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

22
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:12,840
Sure.
