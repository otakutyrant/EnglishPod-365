00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're bringing you another elementary-level lesson as a part of our interview series.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is part two of the interview series, and the last part we talked about, well, a brief introduction when you arrive to a job interview.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But on this occasion, we're going to talk a little bit about yourself and your life.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So this is the most personal part, I think, of an interview.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about the things that you've heard.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, Ms.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Childs passed on your resume to me, and I've had a chance to look it over.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I must say, I'm quite impressed.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, of course.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ah, I see.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So you were actually educated in Europe.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, precisely.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Although I was born in the U.S., I would definitely call London home.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My father was in on the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Very interesting.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Absolutely.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I see.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sure.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So obviously this person had a very interesting life, and they used some pretty interesting words there.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So why don't we take a look at five key words that we have prepared for you on Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
All right, so the first word that we have is right when Mr.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Parsons talked to Ms.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Childs, and he said that he was very impressed with her resume.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right, so someone says, I'm impressed when they think that something that you did or something about you is very interesting or good or better than most people's.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So you're kind of amazed.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're kind of, you're like, wow, right?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And so this is an adjective, I am impressed.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So teachers sometimes say this.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Maybe when you do really, really, really well on a test, they say, hey, Marco, I'm really impressed.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You got 99%.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Parents say this to friends, family.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So basically this is a way to say good job.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wow.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And there's also a verb.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So this is the adjective to be impressed, and the verb form would be to impress someone.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So that's obviously if you impress your teacher by studying, your teacher will be impressed.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And following that, Mr.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Parson has some questions about Ms.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Child's background.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's right.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He asked her for a brief overview of her background.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So we have two interesting words there, an overview.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What is an overview?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
An overview is like a summary.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's basically a way to ask for someone to give you a lot of information in very few words.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So you don't really want too much details.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You don't want somebody to tell you their life in detail.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You just want a brief summary.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So not, I was born on August 11th in 1979, and I was, and then I went into this.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, this is basic, simple, you know, this is where I'm from, this is where I went to school at the end.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And well, he wanted a brief overview of her background.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What exactly is her background?

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, think about the word back.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That means behind.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Or in this case, background is your personal history.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you could ask someone, what's your background?

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It means where are you from or, you know, what have you been doing up to up to now in your life?

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And precisely when he asked her about her background, now she's starting to talk about her her life that in general terms, as we said, it's an overview.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So she said that she's 27 and she's from Brooklyn, et cetera.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So she starts giving very general information about herself and her life.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Exactly.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Exactly.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So when she starts to do this, Mr.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Parson has more specific questions about her life because he wants to know details.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So he asks her then where she was educated.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So this this phrase to be educated is very important.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So he's asking her, you studied in Europe.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
To be educated means to have someone teach you or to go to school somewhere.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So for example, I was educated in America.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Where were you educated, Marco?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was educated in Chile.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wow.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So you've been educated in a number of different places, right?

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
At home and in a different country.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But you can also specify the university name.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
For example, I was educated at Harvard.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Can you say that?

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You can.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or I was educated at a number of different schools.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So you can say I studied or I was educated.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
All right.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And well, apparently she was moving around from Europe, United States.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So Mr.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Parsons says, wow, it seems that you had an adventurous childhood.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is a great adjective, adventurous.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You can say a person is adventurous.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So Marco is very adventurous.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He likes to jump out of airplanes.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But you can also say that an experience is adventurous, like moving around a lot as a child.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So I guess adventurous can go hand in hand with exciting or very interesting, full of emotion.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Adventure adventurous.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So a person can be adventurous.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And we actually had a lesson about this when we describe personalities.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can say someone is adventurous.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All right.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Very good.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So five key words that we just took a look at.

129
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more on Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now, Ms.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Child's passed on your resume to me and I've had a chance to look it over.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I must say I'm quite impressed.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Thank you very much.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, of course.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ah, I see.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So you were actually educated in Europe.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes, precisely.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Very interesting.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Absolutely.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I see.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Sure.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
All right, we're back.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we have four phrases for you on Fluency Builder prepared, and let's start on with the first one.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Fluency Builder.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, so at the very beginning, Mr.

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Parsons is continuing what he was saying in our first part.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So Mr.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Parsons is talking about Rebecca's resume, and he says, someone, the secretary, she passed it on to me.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So this verb, to pass on.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is really important.

163
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What does this mean?

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Well, the secretary, Ms.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Childs, passed on Rebecca's resume.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That basically means Ms.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Childs received it, and she didn't keep it.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She passed it on, or she gave it to another person, in this case, Mr.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Parsons.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, so this implies, this shows that something doesn't stay with one person, like you said, Marco, but it moves from one person to another person.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So for example, my mother told me to pass this message on to you.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The message is not for me, it's for you.

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think also with physical traits, like maybe if your mother had green eyes, you can maybe say, my mom passed on her eye color on to me.

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So you got it from her.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Alright, so that's what happened with the resume, and he said, well, she passed it on, and I've had the chance to look it over.

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, so think about this as a chunk, as a group of words that we use together to look something over, we can say, hey, Marco, when you have a minute, can you look this over for me?

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, so that means to examine or to take a look.

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Take a look at, that's right, so to look something over or to look it over.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Alright, so basically to examine, maybe in close detail, right, you actually take the time to read it.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's right.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And then later on, they started talking about her background.

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
As we know, she was from Brooklyn, she grew up in Brooklyn, and then she moved to London.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And so Rebecca described how she spent most of her life moving from country to country.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay, from country to country.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This means that she moved to many different countries.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, so if I live in America all my life, I never moved from country to country.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You could say this about many different things, from place to place, from town to town.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It means that you live in one, you go from one place to another.

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's right, so as you said, if you replace the noun country, you can say from town to town.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can even say from house to house.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I went from house to house asking for money.

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's right, so from hmm to hmm.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Exactly, so from something to something.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And for our final phrase, she was talking about how she's moved around so much that she's actually ready to settle down.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay, to settle down.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is a really important phrase, and I think it's something a lot of people do when they're maybe in their 30s or 40s.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They don't want to move anymore, so to settle down means to stay in one place.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Exactly, so you stay in one place, and it can have a lot of different meanings as well.

201
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
For example, to get married, many people say that's settling down.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It means you want to stay in one place and have a family.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Or to buy a house, because it means that you will live there for a long time.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Exactly, so to settle down.

205
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So a lot of interesting phrases there, a lot of words, and this is, as we said, part two of our series.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So I think it would be worthy for us to listen to this dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Now, Ms.

208
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Childs passed on your resume to me, and I've had a chance to look it over.

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I must say, I'm quite impressed.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Thank you very much.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

213
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, of course.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ah, I see.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So you were actually educated in Europe.

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes, precisely, although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

221
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Very interesting.

223
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Absolutely.

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I see.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay, well let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
All right, we're back.

229
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So this is part two of a ten-part series of the interviews.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Now we just talked about the background, and I think there are different ways of talking about your background, right?

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is maybe your personal background?

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's right.

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So you can talk about your personal history, your personal background, where you were born, where you were educated, where you grew up.

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But a lot of times we also have to talk about other parts of our background, like our work background or, like next week, our educational background.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's right.

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So part three, we're going to take a look at your educational background.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And it's going to be very important because I think in many interviews people have a hard time describing what they studied or maybe describing exactly what they did during university or college or master's degree or something.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Exactly.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And we're not talking about elementary school or high school.

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
We're specifically talking about university background here.

241
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So like you're saying, Marco, what was your major?

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What was your minor?

243
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What was your area of study?

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
These are great, great, great phrases that are very important for an interview.

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And so we hope that if you have any questions, you'll let us know.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com and stay tuned for next week's episode.

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's right.

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay.

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So we'll see everyone on the website.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And until next time.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Bye.

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Bye.
