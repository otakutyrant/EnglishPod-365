00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,259
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:12,580
My name is Katherine, and today we're bringing you another elementary-level lesson as a part of our interview series.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,380
That's right.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:22,879
This is part two of the interview series, and the last part we talked about, well, a brief introduction when you arrive to a job interview.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,899
But on this occasion, we're going to talk a little bit about yourself and your life.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,699
That's right.

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,839
So this is the most personal part, I think, of an interview.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,240
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about the things that you've heard.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,200
Now, Ms.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,240
Childs passed on your resume to me, and I've had a chance to look it over.

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,640
I must say, I'm quite impressed.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,960
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,939
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

15
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,640
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,119
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,840
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

18
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:05,920
Yes, of course.

19
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:15,519
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,480
Ah, I see.

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
So you were actually educated in Europe.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,819
Yes, precisely.

23
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:24,579
Although I was born in the U.S., I would definitely call London home.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,719
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

25
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,640
My father was in on the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

26
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,120
Very interesting.

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,840
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,760
Absolutely.

29
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:44,859
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,939
I see.

31
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:46,739
Okay.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,079
Well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

33
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:50,659
Sure.

34
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,120
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,640
So obviously this person had a very interesting life, and they used some pretty interesting words there.

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,479
So why don't we take a look at five key words that we have prepared for you on Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,360
All right, so the first word that we have is right when Mr.

38
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,659
Parsons talked to Ms.

39
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,419
Childs, and he said that he was very impressed with her resume.

40
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:35,159
All right, so someone says, I'm impressed when they think that something that you did or something about you is very interesting or good or better than most people's.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,819
That's right.

42
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,979
So you're kind of amazed.

43
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,680
You're kind of, you're like, wow, right?

44
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,360
And so this is an adjective, I am impressed.

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,199
That's right.

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,639
So teachers sometimes say this.

47
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:55,340
Maybe when you do really, really, really well on a test, they say, hey, Marco, I'm really impressed.

48
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:57,680
You got 99%.

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,159
Parents say this to friends, family.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
So basically this is a way to say good job.

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,300
Wow.

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:03,979
Right.

53
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,759
And there's also a verb.

54
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,699
So this is the adjective to be impressed, and the verb form would be to impress someone.

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,500
So that's obviously if you impress your teacher by studying, your teacher will be impressed.

56
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,319
That's right.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,719
And following that, Mr.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
Parson has some questions about Ms.

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,240
Child's background.

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:22,979
That's right.

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,919
He asked her for a brief overview of her background.

62
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,479
So we have two interesting words there, an overview.

63
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,439
What is an overview?

64
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,639
An overview is like a summary.

65
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:40,240
It's basically a way to ask for someone to give you a lot of information in very few words.

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,139
That's right.

67
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,840
So you don't really want too much details.

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,939
You don't want somebody to tell you their life in detail.

69
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,039
You just want a brief summary.

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,879
So not, I was born on August 11th in 1979, and I was, and then I went into this.

71
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:58,620
No, this is basic, simple, you know, this is where I'm from, this is where I went to school at the end.

72
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,460
And well, he wanted a brief overview of her background.

73
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,919
What exactly is her background?

74
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,500
Well, think about the word back.

75
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:07,020
Okay.

76
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,900
That means behind.

77
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,219
Or in this case, background is your personal history.

78
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,560
So you could ask someone, what's your background?

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,720
It means where are you from or, you know, what have you been doing up to up to now in your life?

80
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:21,420
That's right.

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:30,500
And precisely when he asked her about her background, now she's starting to talk about her her life that in general terms, as we said, it's an overview.

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,579
So she said that she's 27 and she's from Brooklyn, et cetera.

83
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,639
So she starts giving very general information about herself and her life.

84
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:40,240
Exactly.

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,300
Exactly.

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,800
So when she starts to do this, Mr.

87
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,899
Parson has more specific questions about her life because he wants to know details.

88
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,839
So he asks her then where she was educated.

89
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,959
So this this phrase to be educated is very important.

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,800
That's right.

91
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,120
So he's asking her, you studied in Europe.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,860
That's right.

93
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,860
To be educated means to have someone teach you or to go to school somewhere.

94
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,779
So for example, I was educated in America.

95
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,000
Where were you educated, Marco?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,819
I was educated in Chile.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,259
Wow.

98
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,459
So you've been educated in a number of different places, right?

99
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,180
At home and in a different country.

100
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:16,600
Right.

101
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,259
But you can also specify the university name.

102
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:20,500
Right.

103
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,699
For example, I was educated at Harvard.

104
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,319
Can you say that?

105
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:23,959
You can.

106
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,720
Or I was educated at a number of different schools.

107
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,860
So you can say I studied or I was educated.

108
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:33,699
All right.

109
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,480
And well, apparently she was moving around from Europe, United States.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,300
So Mr.

111
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,720
Parsons says, wow, it seems that you had an adventurous childhood.

112
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:43,199
Okay.

113
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,360
This is a great adjective, adventurous.

114
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,680
You can say a person is adventurous.

115
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,879
So Marco is very adventurous.

116
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,800
He likes to jump out of airplanes.

117
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,600
But you can also say that an experience is adventurous, like moving around a lot as a child.

118
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,319
Right.

119
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:06,319
So I guess adventurous can go hand in hand with exciting or very interesting, full of emotion.

120
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

121
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:07,680
Okay.

122
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,240
Adventure adventurous.

123
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,120
So a person can be adventurous.

124
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:14,500
And we actually had a lesson about this when we describe personalities.

125
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,259
You can say someone is adventurous.

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,720
All right.

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,199
Very good.

128
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,000
So five key words that we just took a look at.

129
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,980
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more on Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:34,779
Now, Ms.

131
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,800
Child's passed on your resume to me and I've had a chance to look it over.

132
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,199
I must say I'm quite impressed.

133
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,500
Thank you very much.

134
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

135
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,220
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

136
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,680
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

137
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,399
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

138
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,459
Yes, of course.

139
00:06:55,459 --> 00:07:05,139
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

140
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
Ah, I see.

141
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,240
So you were actually educated in Europe.

142
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,360
Yes, precisely.

143
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,139
Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

144
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,300
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

145
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,240
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

146
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,680
Very interesting.

147
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,399
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

148
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,319
Absolutely.

149
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,420
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

150
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:35,500
I see.

151
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:36,319
Okay.

152
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,660
Well, let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

153
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,279
Sure.

154
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,579
All right, we're back.

155
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:52,139
So we have four phrases for you on Fluency Builder prepared, and let's start on with the first one.

156
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,560
Fluency Builder.

157
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,480
Okay, so at the very beginning, Mr.

158
00:07:57,579 --> 00:08:00,759
Parsons is continuing what he was saying in our first part.

159
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,680
So Mr.

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,680
Parsons is talking about Rebecca's resume, and he says, someone, the secretary, she passed it on to me.

161
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,779
So this verb, to pass on.

162
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,160
This is really important.

163
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,740
What does this mean?

164
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,680
Well, the secretary, Ms.

165
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,180
Childs, passed on Rebecca's resume.

166
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,300
That basically means Ms.

167
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:27,019
Childs received it, and she didn't keep it.

168
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,639
She passed it on, or she gave it to another person, in this case, Mr.

169
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:31,079
Parsons.

170
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:40,259
Okay, so this implies, this shows that something doesn't stay with one person, like you said, Marco, but it moves from one person to another person.

171
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:46,059
So for example, my mother told me to pass this message on to you.

172
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,919
The message is not for me, it's for you.

173
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:58,279
I think also with physical traits, like maybe if your mother had green eyes, you can maybe say, my mom passed on her eye color on to me.

174
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,320
That's right.

175
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,320
So you got it from her.

176
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:10,980
Alright, so that's what happened with the resume, and he said, well, she passed it on, and I've had the chance to look it over.

177
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:21,700
Okay, so think about this as a chunk, as a group of words that we use together to look something over, we can say, hey, Marco, when you have a minute, can you look this over for me?

178
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, so that means to examine or to take a look.

179
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,200
Take a look at, that's right, so to look something over or to look it over.

180
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:36,100
Alright, so basically to examine, maybe in close detail, right, you actually take the time to read it.

181
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:36,659
That's right.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,279
Okay.

183
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,720
And then later on, they started talking about her background.

184
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,259
As we know, she was from Brooklyn, she grew up in Brooklyn, and then she moved to London.

185
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:53,360
And so Rebecca described how she spent most of her life moving from country to country.

186
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,299
Okay, from country to country.

187
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,039
This means that she moved to many different countries.

188
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,779
Okay, so if I live in America all my life, I never moved from country to country.

189
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,799
You could say this about many different things, from place to place, from town to town.

190
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,440
It means that you live in one, you go from one place to another.

191
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,659
That's right, so as you said, if you replace the noun country, you can say from town to town.

192
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,059
You can even say from house to house.

193
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,100
I went from house to house asking for money.

194
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,460
That's right, so from hmm to hmm.

195
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,080
Exactly, so from something to something.

196
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:40,899
And for our final phrase, she was talking about how she's moved around so much that she's actually ready to settle down.

197
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,460
Okay, to settle down.

198
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,039
This is a really important phrase, and I think it's something a lot of people do when they're maybe in their 30s or 40s.

199
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,500
They don't want to move anymore, so to settle down means to stay in one place.

200
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,620
Exactly, so you stay in one place, and it can have a lot of different meanings as well.

201
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,159
For example, to get married, many people say that's settling down.

202
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,919
It means you want to stay in one place and have a family.

203
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,700
Or to buy a house, because it means that you will live there for a long time.

204
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,000
Exactly, so to settle down.

205
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,340
So a lot of interesting phrases there, a lot of words, and this is, as we said, part two of our series.

206
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:26,460
So I think it would be worthy for us to listen to this dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

207
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,259
Now, Ms.

208
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:38,299
Childs passed on your resume to me, and I've had a chance to look it over.

209
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,720
I must say, I'm quite impressed.

210
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,019
Thank you very much.

211
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,000
I've tried to keep it short and clear.

212
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,740
If there are any questions, please feel free to ask me.

213
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:52,179
Well, yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview.

214
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,899
I'd like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.

215
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:55,980
Yes, of course.

216
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:05,600
Well, as you can see from the resume, I'm 27 and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around 16.

217
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,519
Ah, I see.

218
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,759
So you were actually educated in Europe.

219
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,639
Yes, precisely, although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home.

220
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,799
But as you see, I've actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country.

221
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,740
My father was in the oil business before he retired, so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia, too.

222
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,200
Very interesting.

223
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,899
So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.

224
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,720
Absolutely.

225
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:34,940
We were never still for too long, but now I'm really looking to settle down.

226
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,000
I see.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,200
Okay, well let's move on to discuss your education, shall we?

228
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
All right, we're back.

229
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,679
So this is part two of a ten-part series of the interviews.

230
00:12:53,139 --> 00:13:01,019
Now we just talked about the background, and I think there are different ways of talking about your background, right?

231
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,059
This is maybe your personal background?

232
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:03,799
That's right.

233
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:11,379
So you can talk about your personal history, your personal background, where you were born, where you were educated, where you grew up.

234
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:20,259
But a lot of times we also have to talk about other parts of our background, like our work background or, like next week, our educational background.

235
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:20,840
That's right.

236
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,779
So part three, we're going to take a look at your educational background.

237
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:38,700
And it's going to be very important because I think in many interviews people have a hard time describing what they studied or maybe describing exactly what they did during university or college or master's degree or something.

238
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,379
Exactly.

239
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,379
And we're not talking about elementary school or high school.

240
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,139
We're specifically talking about university background here.

241
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,379
So like you're saying, Marco, what was your major?

242
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,620
What was your minor?

243
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:52,539
What was your area of study?

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,700
These are great, great, great phrases that are very important for an interview.

245
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,100
And so we hope that if you have any questions, you'll let us know.

246
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,720
Our website is EnglishPod.com and stay tuned for next week's episode.

247
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,360
That's right.

248
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:03,799
Okay.

249
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,299
So we'll see everyone on the website.

250
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,860
And until next time.

251
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,220
Bye.

252
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:07,620
Bye.
