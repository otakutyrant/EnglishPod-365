00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:05,259
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,019
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking about sports and outdoor activities.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,060
That's right.

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,039
We are taking a look at a lot of different adventure sports.

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,660
So they're not just regular sports like tennis or soccer.

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:23,039
These are more dangerous sports.

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:23,879
That's right.

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,559
So adventure sports is the topic.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,739
This is intermediate level.

11
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:29,780
Let's check out the dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,560
Welcome to Adventure Tours.

13
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:39,579
How may I help you?

14
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,219
I want to book a tour with Adventure Sports.

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,100
Excellent.

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,659
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field.

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,100
Let me show you some options.

18
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,020
This is our most popular choice.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,719
Our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.

20
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:05,140
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

21
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:06,500
What else do you have?

22
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:11,280
Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

23
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,799
It's the closest you can get to flying.

24
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,040
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,319
No thank you.

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:18,859
Next?

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,280
Okay.

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like?

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,719
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

30
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,420
I'm thinking something exciting, but safer.

31
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,519
I have the perfect option.

32
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,439
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there's a dog sledding journey.

33
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,439
That's more like it.

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,180
All right, we're back.

35
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:52,680
So obviously this tour agency or tour operator has a lot of different options.

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,859
A lot of them exciting, so why don't we take a look at some of those on Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,900
So the first one has to do with water.

38
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,439
This is called white water rafting.

39
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:08,419
That's right.

40
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,319
So white water rafting.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,620
Now rafting means that you go in a raft.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,379
That's right.

43
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:20,180
It's a special kind of boat, not a wooden boat, not like a big boat you see in the ocean.

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,620
This is a special boat for rivers maybe.

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,439
That's right.

46
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:26,580
It's an inflatable rubber boat.

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,340
So he also described it as a rubber boat.

48
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:32,960
Okay, rubber is the material it's made out of.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,560
That's right.

50
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:41,979
So you go in this boat in a river and it's called white water because it has rapids.

51
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:46,840
So the river is moving very quickly and you can see that it's a little bit dangerous to go swimming in a river like this.

52
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:47,539
That's right.

53
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:57,340
And so when the water goes really fast or when it hits some rocks, the color changes from being blue or brown to white, and that's why it's white water rafting.

54
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,539
It's very, very scary and very dangerous.

55
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,060
That's right, but very exciting.

56
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,759
So that's considered an adventure sport.

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,759
And then the trip was followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.

58
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,039
Well, everyone's seen balloons before.

59
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:17,419
Sometimes we give children balloons at the fair or maybe for their birthday.

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,620
Balloons are basically rubber filled with air.

61
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,979
But a hot air balloon is a very special kind of mode of transportation actually.

62
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,879
You can travel in a hot air balloon.

63
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,460
That's right.

64
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:33,460
It's a big, big balloon that has a basket under it.

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,219
And the person actually described it as a wicker basket.

66
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:40,939
A wicker is the material that's used in the basket, right?

67
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,479
That's right.

68
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,819
You can have wicker furniture, like wicker chairs.

69
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:51,520
It's just a way to basically make furniture out of this kind of bark or natural material.

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,819
So a hot air balloon is a very big balloon, and it's filled with hot air, usually by some sort of fire that's under it.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,020
And because it's filled with hot air, it goes up in the air.

72
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:13,139
And as you say, you can use it as transportation, maybe to go very long distances carried by the wind because there's no real way of giving it direction or just for fun.

73
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,039
That's right.

74
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,899
It's another dangerous but less dangerous kind of sport.

75
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,060
But after that, we actually have one that I think you have some experience with.

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,279
It's called hang gliding.

77
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:22,899
That's right.

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,259
Hang gliding is another type of sport, also a type of flying sport.

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,199
And basically, you get on a hang glider.

80
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,300
Okay.

81
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,579
So if you've seen this before, you'll know that it looks like someone is wearing wings.

82
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,639
It's a big kite that you wear.

83
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,720
It's a big kite.

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,000
It kind of looks like a triangle, like a kite.

85
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,540
And you fly in it.

86
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,459
So it has no motor.

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,100
It has not like the hot air balloon, it has no fire.

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,540
So you just basically glide, you just sail through the air, the atmosphere.

89
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:00,579
Sounds very peaceful.

90
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,399
It is.

91
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:04,339
But they say that you should go with an instructor.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,939
So what kind of instructor does this tour company offer?

93
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,740
That's right.

94
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:14,800
The tour operator talked about taking you on a hang glider trip with one of our experienced instructors.

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,560
So experienced is the key word here.

96
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,139
You want someone who has done this many times before, someone who knows what they are doing.

97
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,079
That's right.

98
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:30,439
So an experienced instructor is a person that has, as you say, a lot of experience or is a professional.

99
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,180
So that's an experienced instructor.

100
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,420
Right.

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,040
You could even say, you know, I want to take flying lessons with an experienced pilot.

102
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,560
Right.

103
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,339
Or you can even talk about maybe a chef.

104
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,420
He is a very experienced chef.

105
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,980
He's been a chef for a long time.

106
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,540
That's right.

107
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,139
So hang gliding and our final sport, very exciting as well.

108
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,720
We are going dog sledding.

109
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:53,560
Okay.

110
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,100
So this is basically a winter sport or a sport that you do in snowy places.

111
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:06,959
You stand or sit on a sled and a team of dogs, so that means many dogs, pull you across the snow.

112
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:07,759
That's right.

113
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:15,100
So you go on a sled, which is basically usually made out of plastic or wood, and this is to go on top of the snow.

114
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,480
And as you say, a team of dogs pull you.

115
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,519
I think you can see this in movies.

116
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,060
This is kind of like the mode of transportation in places where there are no roads.

117
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,620
There are no other ways of getting places that you just get pulled by dogs.

118
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,100
Like Alaska or the Arctic Circle, somewhere very, very far north.

119
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,779
Exactly.

120
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:35,819
So a lot of great adventure sports.

121
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:36,800
Very exciting.

122
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,759
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue again.

123
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,420
And we'll be back in a bit with language takeaway part two.

124
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,220
Welcome to adventure tours.

125
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,160
How may I help you?

126
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,860
I want to book a tour with adventure sports.

127
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,660
Excellent.

128
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,240
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field.

129
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,660
Let me show you some options.

130
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,579
This is our most popular choice.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,319
Our river guides will take you on a whitewater rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks and a rubber boat, or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

133
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,079
What else do you have?

134
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,839
Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

135
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,399
It's the closest you can get to flying.

136
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:27,620
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

137
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,879
No thank you.

138
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,420
Next?

139
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Mm, okay.

140
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,259
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like?

141
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,259
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

142
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,980
I'm thinking something exciting, but safer.

143
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,060
I have the perfect option.

144
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,000
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there's a dog sledding journey.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,699
That's more like it.

146
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,579
All right, we're back.

147
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,439
So now we're going to take a look at three quick adjectives that we saw in this dialogue on Language Takeaway Part Two.

148
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,740
Language Takeaway.

149
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,319
This first adjective is something I am not a fan of.

150
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:20,060
Let me just say if you ever go rafting and you see rocks, you want to avoid or you want to stay away from jagged rocks.

151
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,720
That's right.

152
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,399
So the adjective jagged refers to maybe sharp or they can cut you, right?

153
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:26,959
That's right.

154
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,060
So something that is jagged is not smooth.

155
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,600
It's the opposite of smooth.

156
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,200
That's right.

157
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:39,460
So maybe you've seen some rocks that are very pointy or that have things that can easily hurt you or cut you.

158
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,320
Those are jagged rocks.

159
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,720
Broken glass can have jagged edges and that means you want to avoid touching it because it can hurt you.

160
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:47,320
Exactly.

161
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:47,519
Exactly.

162
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,779
So jagged is a way of describing something that's maybe sharp, pointy or very dangerous that can cut you.

163
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:06,879
And then moving on, when we were talking about the hot air balloon, this person very cleverly said that he doesn't want to go up in the air in a basket held by an oversized balloon.

164
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,179
Okay, so he's exaggerating.

165
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
Like you said, he's being clever or silly.

166
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,960
He's just afraid of the balloon.

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,740
But basically he's saying an oversized balloon is a very, very, very big or unnaturally big balloon.

168
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,419
Right, so bigger than normal.

169
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,360
So an oversized balloon would be a balloon that's bigger than normal.

170
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:32,879
Or maybe I've seen an oversized...

171
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,559
In the early 1990s, I remember a clothing trend, a lot of people like to wear oversized t-shirts.

172
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:39,179
That's right.

173
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,779
So t-shirts that were way too big for you or maybe unnaturally big, those would be oversized t-shirts.

174
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,220
Like XXXL.

175
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:46,919
Exactly.

176
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:48,039
All right.

177
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:59,460
And our final adjective when he was talking about hang gliding, he said that he's not ready to go up in the air strapped to a flimsy kite.

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,740
Okay, so the key word here is flimsy.

179
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:03,340
We already talked about a kite.

180
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:04,740
It's something that flies in the air.

181
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,720
But something that's flimsy is not very stable or sturdy.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,360
That's right.

183
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,500
So it doesn't seem like it's very solid.

184
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,100
So if you have a kite...

185
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,419
A normal airplane is very sturdy, but a paper airplane is very flimsy, it's thin, it moves around a lot.

186
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,440
You can't control it.

187
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,100
Exactly.

188
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,419
So it's not very solid.

189
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,580
It's not very, as you said, sturdy.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,940
It doesn't really seem like it can stay up in the air for very long.

191
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,000
And it definitely can't support someone's weight.

192
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,980
That's right.

193
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,159
So you can even have a flimsy chair.

194
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,700
Maybe the chair is a little bit loose or it doesn't seem like it's very strong.

195
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,179
It feels like it might break.

196
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,019
That's right.

197
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,379
So flimsy.

198
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,279
That's the adjective there, flimsy.

199
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,779
So that's all the adjectives we have for you today.

200
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,919
Why don't we listen to the dialogue quickly one last time.

201
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:54,019
And we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

202
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,759
Welcome to Adventure Tours.

203
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:04,779
How may I help you?

204
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,419
I want to book a tour with Adventure Sports.

205
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,279
Excellent.

206
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,840
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the Adventure Tourism and Sports field.

207
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,299
Let me show you some options.

208
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,220
This is our most popular choice.

209
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,899
Our river guides will take you on a white water rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.

210
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:30,320
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

211
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,679
What else do you have?

212
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,440
Well, in that case, we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

213
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,980
It's the closest you can get to flying.

214
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:39,779
What?

215
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,259
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

216
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,480
No thank you.

217
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:44,019
Next?

218
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,539
Mmm, okay.

219
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,860
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like?

220
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,860
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

221
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,600
I'm thinking something exciting, but safer.

222
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,700
I have the perfect option.

223
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,620
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there's a dog sledding journey.

224
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,320
That's more like it.

225
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,740
Okay, so Marco, I know this is one of your favorite areas, adventure sports.

226
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,059
You're a lot more daring than I am because I wouldn't do many of these things, but what have you done?

227
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,720
I've actually haven't been in a hot air balloon.

228
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,039
I don't really think that's very exciting.

229
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:30,720
It does seem kind of boring.

230
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:32,340
Yeah, you don't really go very fast.

231
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:40,779
And I've never done a street luge, which is an interesting sport, although it is pretty dangerous.

232
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,059
It's basically, you're kind of riding on a type of skateboard, right?

233
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:54,419
Yeah, basically it's a big skateboard and you lie down on it, your feet go down and your head is back, you're on your back and you go downhill really fast.

234
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:14,419
This is actually an Olympic sport and it's simply called luge and you can see this with those big icy tracks that they have and they go downhill and they slide down on a bob sled or luge would actually be the same thing, but just one or two people on some type of like skateboard looking thing.

235
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:15,480
Basically it's open.

236
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:26,639
The bob sled is closed, so you see the people's heads, but the luge, you just see their whole body and they're lying down on a piece of metal and they go down very, very quickly.

237
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:27,639
They go very fast.

238
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:34,480
I think in bob sledding and luge, I think they can reach speeds up to like 100 kilometers per hour.

239
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,100
That's right.

240
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:41,679
And this year it was actually very sad at the Olympics, a luge, I think it was luge athlete died in practice.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,440
That's right.

242
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:50,960
So extreme sports or adventure sports, they are, as the name says, full of adventure, very exciting, but also obviously very dangerous.

243
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,580
I think hiking is not really an adventure sport or very dangerous unless you're hiking in dangerous territory with bears or something.

244
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,379
Possible.

245
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,240
Well, maybe you guys should let us know what kind of sports do you do?

246
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,799
Do you enjoy adventure sports?

247
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,940
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

248
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,320
All right.

249
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,039
We'll see everyone there.

250
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,340
Bye.
