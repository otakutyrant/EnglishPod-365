00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Welcome to Adventure Tours.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How may I help you?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I want to book a tour with Adventure Sports.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Excellent!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Our company has more than 10 years of experience in the Adventure Tourism and Sports field.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let me show you some options.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is our most popular choice.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Our river guides will take you on a white water rafting trip followed by a ride in a hot air balloon.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't really think I'm ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks and a rubber boat.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversized balloon.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What else do you have?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, in that case we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the closest you can get to flying.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No thank you.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Next?

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, well why don't you tell me a little bit more about what you would like.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We have everything from mountain biking to rock climbing to street luge.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm thinking something exciting but safer.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I have the perfect option.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there's a dog sledding journey.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's more like it!
