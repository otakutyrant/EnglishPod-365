A coffee would be lovely, thank you.

No problem.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

Parsons.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Ms.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Childs last week?

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, that's correct.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Great.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview, and here we are.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, of course.
