Parsons.

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,679
So, Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Ms.

20
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:43,579
Childs last week?

21
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:44,780
Yes, that's correct.

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,399
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

23
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,500
Great.

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,960
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview, and here we are.

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,679
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,820
Yes, of course.
