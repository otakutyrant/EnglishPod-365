00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very special lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This is actually the first in a series of lessons about interview skills.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For 10 lessons that you will hear once a week for the next 10 weeks, we're going to take a look at an interview, a job interview, and we're going to take you step by step throughout the whole interview process, as well as teaching you some useful words and phrases that you can use next time you're at a job interview in English.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Exactly.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So, pay attention.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Today is the first day we're going to be entering the office, and we're going to learn some things that are important for talking to your future employer or meeting people in an interview.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come in.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Mr.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Parsons?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah, you must be Rebecca.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please do come in.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you for making some time to see me, Mr.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Parsons.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a pleasure to meet you finally.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The pleasure's all mine, Rebecca.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Have a seat, please.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, would you like any refreshments, tea, or coffee?

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A coffee would be lovely, thank you.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Black, no sugar.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No problem.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
One, no milk or sugar.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Certainly, Mr.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Parsons.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So, Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Ms.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Childs last week?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, that's correct.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Great.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview, and here we are.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, of course.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right, we're back.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, now let's take a look at language takeaway.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So, one of the first things that you're offered when you go to interview at a company is refreshments.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Would you like any refreshments?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This sounds complicated, but it's actually a very simple word for beverages or drinks.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Right, so that's why he offered her tea or coffee.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, refreshments are cola, coffee, tea, but how do you answer this?

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If I say, would you like any refreshments, Marco?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can say, yes, water would be fine, thank you.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay, water would be fine, or I'd like a Coke.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Or I'd like a cup of coffee.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Cup of coffee, great.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Refreshments are drinks.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And after that, the characters are talking about the details of the job.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So, what are these details?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How are they different from the job itself?

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, the details of the job are the specific points about the job.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, for example, if she applied for a job as a receptionist, the details of the job would be answering the phones, taking messages, receiving people at the office.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Those are the main details of the job.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Also, we need someone who works from 9 a.m.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to 5 p.m., someone who is going to come five days a week.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, the details are basically more information about something.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Right, the specific information about a general topic.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And it's not only related to work, the details can be of many, many things.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Right, so if I ask you about your details, Marco, you could maybe tell me your phone number, your address.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My full name.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Full name or birthday, so these are details.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, and well, after they talked about the details of the job, after she explained that she received the details of the job by phone, Mr.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Parsons said that she was recommended for a second interview.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, Rebecca is coming to the office for a second time.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She already had one interview, and the woman she talked to the first time recommended her for a second interview.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, the verb here is to recommend.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right, and you can recommend a person, an object, a movie, and that's basically you are saying that this is good, and that it's worth seeing, it's worth buying, it's worth interviewing.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
For example, I really like the movie Avatar.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Marco, I recommend you see it.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, or I can say, Catherine recommended the movie Avatar.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, so Catherine liked it, Catherine decided, Catherine suggested or told Marco it would be good.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right, so to recommend, and then Mr.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Parsons said that they're going to start discussing her background.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, background, think of the word back, that means behind.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This usually means a person's history at a job or at many jobs or even their educational background, information about where they studied.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's right, so the background, maybe a person's background is, as you said, all their history, work, study, many, many different things, even maybe seminars or courses that they assisted.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Or even just their personal history, for example, Marco, you speak English like an American, what's your background, because I know you're not American.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Right, I'm from Ecuador.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, background, so that means someone's personal history.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right, and hand in hand with background, we have a piece of paper that usually you send in to an employer to apply for a job.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is the famous resume.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Resume, so you're right, Marco, resume is a document.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In this case, it is a document that lists your work history, your working background, and it's a very important part of applying for a job, and usually you send your resume before you go for the interview, so that the employer can look and see, is this person qualified, how old are they, what's their work history.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And, well, very similar to a resume, you may have heard a CV.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's right, a CV is a lot like a resume, it stands for Curriculum C, Vitae V, CV, and it's more detailed, it has more details about a person's academic or study history.

90
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Exactly, so a resume, I guess it's very similar to a summary, a summary of your work background, whereas a CV will have more details about your education, maybe more details about your work background, what did you do, objectives, etc.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Great, so maybe we should listen to today's dialogue one more time, and when we come back, we'll be talking about some of the interesting phrases we heard in today's dialogue.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Come in.

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mr.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Parsons?

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ah, you must be Rebecca, please do come in.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you for making some time to see me, Mr.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Parsons, it's a pleasure to meet you finally.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The pleasure's all mine, Rebecca.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Have a seat, please.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now, would you like any refreshments, tea, or coffee?

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A coffee would be lovely, thank you.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Black, no sugar.

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No problem.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
One, no milk or sugar.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Certainly, Mr.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Parsons.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So, Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Miss Childs last week?

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, that's correct.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

111
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Great.

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview, and here we are.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, of course.

115
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All right, we're back.

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So now we have three phrases that we're going to take a look at on Fluency Builder.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Fluency Builder.

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
All right, so when Rebecca arrived, Mr.

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Parsons said, ah, you must be Rebecca, please do come in.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay, so you could say please come in.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This means please come into my office or come on in.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Right.

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But here, the interesting thing about this is the word do.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right, he's using the verb do, and it may sound wrong.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It may sound like it's unnecessary because you do have a phrasal verb there already, come in.

126
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you can just say please come in.

127
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But when he says please do come in, he is emphasizing on her to come in.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's right, so this is a very polite way to invite someone inside.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can also say please do have a seat.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
All right, so again, you are emphasizing in a very polite way to please sit down.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's right, please do come in.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So there are many other ways that you can use it.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So for example, if you really want your friend to call you sometime next time you're in town, say please do call me next time you're in town.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Please do.

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You could even say it afterwards, simply please do for emphasis.

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Right, so if I say, hey, Catherine, I'm going to call you next time I'm in Shanghai.

137
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Please do.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There you go.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So that means please do call.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All right, so please do come in, please do call.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All right.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
After that, Rebecca says thank you for making some time to see me, Mr.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Parsons.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So she is happy that Mr.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Parsons is available and wants to talk to her.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is a very common phrase that means thank you so much for interviewing me.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Right, so I guess it's kind of a way of saying, look, I know that you're a busy person and that you don't have very much time, so thank you for making some time to see me.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right, so this isn't just about interviews.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You could say this phrase for meeting with a client or meeting with even a friend.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You could say, hey, Marco, I know you were really busy last week, but thank you so much for making some time to see me.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Right, so you're just basically saying I understand that you're very busy, but I appreciate that you made some time to see me.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
All right, and well, she said, you know what, it's a pleasure to meet you, but Mr.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Parsons replied by saying, hey, the pleasure is all mine.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
All right, another very, very polite phrase that you hear a lot.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Maybe some of you have heard the phrase it's a pleasure to meet you before, but the response, the answer is very interesting.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The pleasure is all mine.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Right.

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So this stands for the pleasure is all mine.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Right, and I guess it's the most appropriate response if somebody says it's a pleasure to meet you, because if you don't say this, I think you may sound a little bit arrogant.

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, you could say it's a pleasure to meet you too, but this is another way to answer the person, because you don't always want to say it's a pleasure to meet you.

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is a way to say something different and to say, well, the pleasure is all mine.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Right, but it's very important to answer something, right, because if I say it's a pleasure to meet you and you say thank you, it's like...

164
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
No, that is a little bit arrogant.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So you have to say something, and we recommend that you say this or you just say the same thing back.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So it's nice to meet you.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

168
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Right.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, and our last phrase is actually when they were talking about, again, the details of the job, and she said that Ms.

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Childs filled her in on the details.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
She said she filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Okay, so this is an interesting verb, to fill in, or in this case, to fill someone in, to fill me in, to fill you in.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This basically means to tell someone about something, or if I know a little bit of information but not a lot of information about something, this way you're telling me more so I understand it better.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Right, I'm giving you all the information.

175
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So maybe somebody is talking about a rumor in the office, and you go and you say, hey, fill me in on the gossip.

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
All right, so you want to know all about it.

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or for example, Marco, we're having a party next Sunday, but I'll have to fill you in on the details around Friday.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okay, because you don't have all the information right now.

179
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, I don't know yet what time or where.

180
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay, so to fill someone in is to give them all the information or to give them more information.

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Fill me in.

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
All right, why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back in a little bit.

183
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Come in.

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mr.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Parsons?

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Ah, you must be Rebecca.

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Please do come in.

188
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Thank you for making some time to see me, Mr.

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Parsons.

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's a pleasure to meet you finally.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Have a seat, please.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Now, would you like any refreshments, tea, or coffee?

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A coffee would be lovely, thank you.

195
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Black, no sugar.

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No problem.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Sally, can we have two coffees, please?

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
One, no milk or sugar.

199
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Certainly, Mr.

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Parsons.

201
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So, Rebecca, I understand you had a first interview with Miss Childs last week?

202
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, that's correct.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She filled me in on the details of the job on the telephone.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Great.

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, I'm glad to say she recommended you for a second interview, and here we are.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little.

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes, of course.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All right, so as we mentioned, this is the first part of a ten-part series of the interview series.

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And this is going to be very, very helpful.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,000
As you saw, in this first part, we're just taking a look at some basic vocab and phrases that you can use when you're just introducing yourself, you're just getting started in the interview.

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, what we're going to be looking at later on is talking about yourself, answering questions.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But many people don't realize that one of the most important parts of the interview is the very, very beginning.

213
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because some psychologists say that we make a decision about a person or how we like a person within the first, I think, what, 30 seconds of talking to them.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I think so, yeah.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So, it's important that you speak confidently and that you say some of these English phrases comfortably.

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You know, it's a pleasure to meet you.

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, the pleasure's mine.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
These little things will really help you.

219
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's right.

220
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And I think, as talking about introductions and how this woman arrived to the office, I think one of the key things that we would recommend is to look that person in the eye and give a firm handshake, right?

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know how many people actually realize how important this is.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's very, very important because as an interviewer, the person or the manager who's interviewing you, I think you can tell a lot from a person if somebody gives you a very flimsy handshake or doesn't look you in the eye.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's right.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well, I think, in many ways, people think, oh, this person is not confident or this person is uncomfortable or this person is hiding something.

225
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And so, it's important really to be yourself, to smile, to look at a person in the eyes, especially in a lot of American companies or Canadian companies.

226
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I know in other parts of the world, smiling with a stranger is unusual or maybe unacceptable, but in America, it means I'm confident, here I am, here's my name, nice to meet you.

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's a very important part of an introduction.

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes, very true.

229
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So, we actually want to hear what you think, how important for you is a handshake, a firm handshake, looking someone in the eye or how do interviews work in your country?

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let us know and we hope that this is helpful for you in the future if you're looking for jobs or you just want to practice your English.

231
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's right.

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So, if you have any other questions or doubts, we're at EnglishPod.com.

233
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We'll see everyone there.

234
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Bye.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,000
.
