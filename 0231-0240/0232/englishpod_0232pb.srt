00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,940
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,619
My name is Katherine, and we have a very fun lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:10,380
That's right.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,960
We're going to talk about toys.

6
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:20,160
So we're going to actually take a look at a lot of different types of toys, and we're going to be listening to a couple of commercials.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:20,839
That's right.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,519
So we've got two children who are watching TV, and they're listening to a number of different commercials.

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,460
So we're going to learn about some of these very popular products in a moment.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,100
Let's first listen to our dialogue.

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,179
SpongeBob SquarePants will be right back after these brave messages.

12
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,159
What's that on the horizon?

13
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:45,320
A pirate ship!

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,320
Raid villages and find buried treasure with these new pirate's Lego set.

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,579
Build the ship and decide who rules the sea.

16
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:52,479
Arr!

17
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,100

Can I get that for my birthday?

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,540
Wolverine, Jean Grey, Rogue, and Professor X.

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,200
Collect all four of these special edition collectible X-Men action figures and decide the future of the mutants in our world.

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,099
No way!

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,599
I want Professor X!

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,840
The new collector's edition nursery rhymes porcelain dolls.

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,299
Little Bo Peep comes with her own shape and staff.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,219
Her clothes are made with the finest fabrics and real Italian lace.

31

Only $199.

33
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,560
Ooh, she's pretty!

34
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,579
I've never had a porcelain doll before.

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,319
I doubt Mom and Dad will get you that for your birthday.

36
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,000
She costs a pretty penny.

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,219
Plus, you'd most likely break her.

38
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:52,340
What is better than a board?

39
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,719
What is better than one board game?

40
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,480
Three board games in one!

41
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,500
Enjoy playing chess and checkers on this side of the board.

42
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,260
But if you're looking for some more fun, flip it and play the classic game of Sorry.

43
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,760
That's ingenious!

44
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,139
Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,680
Now you can take SpongeBob SquarePants wherever you go with the new SpongeBob SquarePants glow in the dark yo-yo.

46
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:17,099
And now, back to our show.

47
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:24,379
Alright, we're back.

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:33,300
So a lot of great toys and actually it's very popular that while maybe you're watching cartoons, you get a lot of these commercials that are selling you all types of toys.

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,740
Absolutely, because normally children watch cartoons and children like toys, so it makes sense.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:39,580
Exactly.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,039
So why don't we take a look at six keywords that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,080
Okay, Marco, so what's the first word we're looking at here today?

53
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,020
Alright, we have actually a brand, a very famous type of toy.

54
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,819
They're called Legos.

55
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,039
Legos.

56
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,780
So Lego, Legos.

57
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,360
Legos.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,060
So Legos are basically little pieces that you put together to build things.

59
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,439
Yeah, they're like little blocks.

60
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,620
Okay, so when you see them, they don't look like anything.

61
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,300
But as a child, you get to create anything you want.

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,840
So Legos have become very famous.

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:27,000
They have like special types that you can recreate maybe a spaceship from Star Wars, a pirate ship, a lot of different types now.

64
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,319
Okay, so the one in today's commercial is Pirate Legos.

65
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,860
So they're building a pirate ship.

66
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,340
Exactly, Legos.

67
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:37,379
Alright, and the next toy that we have is also a proper noun.

68
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,020
It's a brand and it's called Play-Doh.

69
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,259
Play-Doh.

70
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,360
Okay, so play like playing with something, playing basketball, but Play-Doh is...

71
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,520
It's like clay, right?

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,479
It's like clay, but it's made out of flour, I think, and you can shape it into anything you want.

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,000
So when I was little, I used to make Play-Doh animals.

74
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,460
You know, you could make a ball and you make another ball and then all of a sudden you have a cow.

75
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:10,000
Right, so it's a very soft texture type of a material that you can mold.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,620
You can give it different shapes and that's what we call Play-Doh.

77
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,939
Obviously, as you say, it's safe for children.

78
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,439
I think it's made out of some flour.

79
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,500
Salt and flour.

80
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,120
And I think a lot of children sometimes eat this, so it's pretty safe for kids.

81
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,180
Right, so yeah, that's Play-Doh.

82
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,279
It's a proper noun and I guess everyone just calls it Play-Doh.

83
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,920
So this is the toy that we're talking about.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,839
Now moving on, we are talking about the X-Men.

85
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:43,399
Wolverine, Jean Grey, Rogue, Professor X, and all of these come in little statues that we call action figures.

86
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:47,800
Alright, so what you're talking about here are obviously the X-Men, Marco.

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,899
And X-Men, there are many different kinds of X-Men.

88
00:04:51,060 --> 00:05:01,920
You have, like you said, Wolverine, who's maybe one of the most famous, and Rogue, but when you collect these little statues, these little dolls, they're called action figures.

89
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,040
So a figure is like a kind of doll.

90
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,980
Right, so the X-Men is just an example.

91
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,139
You have action figures of all sorts of cartoons or movies.

92
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:14,000
Star Wars action figures are very popular.

93
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,079
Right, or G.I.

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,540
Joe action figures are very popular as well.

95
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,740
That's right, so they're little toy statues that children play with.

96
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,300
Alright, moving on, now we have an adjective, a way to describe the X-Men.

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,300
That's right, so the X-Men, as you know, are not normal people.

98
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,920
They have special powers.

99
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,620
Some X-Men can fly.

100
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,839
Wolverine has animal abilities.

101
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:41,480
He can use his long claws.

102
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,199
So these are mutants.

103
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:50,819
That means that they were humans, but something changed in them, and it makes them have these special powers.

104
00:05:50,819 --> 00:06:00,319
Okay, so a mutant is maybe a person that has special powers, like as you say Wolverine and all these types of X-Men.

105
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:07,319
But I guess taking maybe a look at the verb mutate, that means to change.

106
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,379
To change, right?

107
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,620
Okay, so to mutate is to change.

108
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,079
So we could say, I found a frog that had three legs.

109
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,000
So it clearly mutated, because normally frogs have like four legs.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,959
Exactly, you see that sometimes with chickens that maybe have two heads or something like this.

111
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,819
These are mutants.

112
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:27,839
They have mutated.

113
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,100
Okay, very good.

114
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,199
And now moving on to our dolls.

115
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:35,899
They were talking about these beautiful porcelain dolls.

116
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,399
Okay, so let's talk about porcelain, because I think everyone knows what a doll is, but porcelain is a special kind of doll, right?

117
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,639
Right, it's a material.

118
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,540
And usually you can find this material very commonly in your plates.

119
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,699
Alright, so it's not clear, it's not glass.

120
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,720
It's colored, it's normally whitish, and very, very fine, very pretty.

121
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,759
So you call it porcelain.

122
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,500
I guess it's a type of ceramic, right?

123
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,139
That's right.

124
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,680
Okay, so yeah, you have porcelain dolls.

125
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,300
Many people also have very fine china that you call it, like dinner plates.

126
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,279
Or teacups.

127
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:13,160
Or teacups, and those are usually made of porcelain.

128
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:21,699
Alright, and finally they were talking about a game that has three games in one, and one of the kids said, wow, that's ingenious.

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,079
Ingenious.

130
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,160
This is a great word.

131
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,639
Makes you sound really fluent.

132
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:28,220
So ingenious basically means clever.

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:28,879
Right.

134
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,120
It's a really good idea.

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,420
It's very clever, good idea, yeah.

136
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,100
So if something is ingenious, it's just, wow, it's very creative.

137
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:44,800
For example, I have a pair of gloves, but on the fingers sometimes I can pull a cover over them and they turn into mittens.

138
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:45,899
Right?

139
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,939
I think it's ingenious.

140
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,660
You have gloves and mittens.

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,800
Because I have gloves and mittens all the time.

142
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:58,819
Alright, so a lot of interesting words there, a lot of specific toys, and particularly brands that you may or may not know.

143
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,519
But why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

144
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,019
SpongeBob SquarePants will be right back after these brief messages.

145
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,939

00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,500

I've never had a porcelain doll before.

166
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,419
I doubt Mom and Dad will get you that for your birthday.

167
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,080
She costs a pretty penny.

168
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Plus, you'd most likely break her.

169
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,159
What is better than a board- What is better than one board game?

170
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,899
Three board games in one!

171
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,940
Enjoy playing chess and checkers on this side of the board.

172
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,639
But if you're looking for some more fun, flip it and play the classic game of Sorry!

173
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
That's ingenious!

174
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,639
Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?

175
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:51,200
Now you can take SpongeBob SquarePants wherever you go with the new SpongeBob SquarePants glow-in-the-dark yo-yo.

176
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,659
And now, back to our show.

177
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:11,500
Okay, so the first phrase here in Fluency Builder is a really important one for anyone who's buying anything because you often see this phrase on packages or you hear it in commercials.

178
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:12,759
Right.

179
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,980
As you saw in the Play-Doh commercial, the guy said, treasure chest sold separately.

180
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,039
Okay, sold separately.

181
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:23,440
That means the treasure chest is not included.

182
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,000
You have to buy it extra.

183
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,179
As you say, you usually see it in packaging as well.

184
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:33,340
Maybe you buy a toy car and at the bottom it will say, batteries sold separately.

185
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,720
That means there are no batteries in the box.

186
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,600
You have to buy batteries extra.

187
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,559
Exactly.

188
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,639
So that's what the phrase sold separately means.

189
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,240
It indicates that it's not included in the product that you are buying.

190
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,200
Alright, now moving on again to the action figures and the dolls.

191
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,799
We saw this very interesting way of describing them.

192
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:59,559
For example, the action figures said, special edition collectible X-Men action figures.

193
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,139
Okay, special edition.

194
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,940
This is really important and it's very common I think with special toys or action figures or even baseball cards.

195
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,440
Special edition means that they're produced specially on one occasion, at one time.

196
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,960
They're not always produced.

197
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:17,639
Right.

198
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,179
So for example, if you have like you say, baseball cards or maybe action figures.

199
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,519
They're produced normally but then a limited amount, a special type of the same action figure will be produced.

200
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,580
So that's a special edition or also commonly known as a collector's edition.

201
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,480
Alright, so some people collect stamps.

202
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,539
You know, stamps for letters that you send.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,600
And I know many countries like America offer special edition or collector's edition stamps.

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,460
These are produced once and usually they mark a special occasion like the Olympics in 1996.

205
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,340
We had special edition stamps.

206
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Right.

207
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:58,460
So these special edition objects are usually not used.

208
00:11:58,779 --> 00:12:01,240
They're for collectors like the name says, right?

209
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,080
Collector's edition.

210
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,480
Right.

211
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,659
So you plan to sell them later on or you collect them for yourself.

212
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,120
They're not normal.

213
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:08,779
Right.

214
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,539
They usually go up in value because they're very limited.

215
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,120
That's right.

216
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,600
Okay.

217
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
So collector's edition, special edition.

218
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,879
And now when they were talking about the porcelain dolls as well, it's pretty expensive, right?

219
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,740
Almost $200.

220
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,559
That's a really expensive doll.

221
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,620
And so one of the kids said, you know what?

222
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,220
I think mom and dad won't buy you that because it costs a pretty penny.

223
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,000
A pretty penny.

224
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,899
This does not mean that the penny is beautiful.

225
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,480
Right.

226
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,500
A penny is a one cent coin in the United States.

227
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:42,139
That means it's very, very low in value, the coin.

228
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,919
But a pretty penny is actually the opposite.

229
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:46,480
It means it's very expensive.

230
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:51,240
So why would, how would you use this in another, in another example?

231
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,440
I've always wanted to buy a Ferrari, but man, Ferraris cost a pretty penny.

232
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,039
Okay.

233
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,519
So you have to add the word cost before you say pretty penny, right?

234
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,139
That's right.

235
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,679
You can't say it is a pretty penny.

236
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,440
You have to say it costs a pretty penny or...

237
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,620
It's worth a pretty penny.

238
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,000
Exactly.

239
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,279
It's worth a pretty penny.

240
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:09,700
Okay.

241
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:10,759
Very good.

242
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:20,559
And for our last phrase, I think this one is a very good phrase because it describes a lot of different toys that glow in the dark, glow in the dark toys.

243
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,059
Okay.

244
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:29,360
So something that glows in the dark, the verb here is to glow, means that it can be seen even when it's dark.

245
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:37,379
So for example, when I turn the lights off and I can see this yo-yo in my room, that means it's glow in the dark.

246
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,159
It has light even in the dark.

247
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:39,659
Right.

248
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,179
So there are a lot of different toys and things like this.

249
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,519
Usually glow in the dark toys, they have a green glow, right?

250
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,559
They look green in the dark.

251
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,039
I used to have stars.

252
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:56,620
So they were stickers, star stickers, and I put them on my ceiling so that when I was in bed, I could look at them and they were glow in the dark.

253
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,840
So when the lights were off, I still had stars.

254
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,059
You can still see them, right?

255
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,879
So yeah, glow in the dark.

256
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,460
It's a way of describing an item, an object that you are able to see in the dark.

257
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,600
All right.

258
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,620
So that's all we have for you on language.

259
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:10,659
All right.

260
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:12,399
So that's all we have for you on Fluency Builder.

261
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,399
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk some more.

262
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:42,399
Yes.

263
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,320
Make large, colorful gems for you and your friends with five special molds.

264
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,980
Comes with the new Sparkling Grides Play-Doh Compound in four new colors.

265
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:53,419
Treasure chest sold separately.

266
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,419
Wow, Mommy, can I get that for my birthday?

267
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:07,019
Wolverine, Jean Grey, Rogue, and Professor X, collect all four of these special edition collectible X-Men action figures and decide the future of the mutants in our world.

268
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:07,960
No way.

269
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,440
I want Professor X.

270
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,220
The new Collector's Edition Nursery Rhymes Porcelain Dolls.

271
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,080
Little Bo Peep comes with her own shape and staff.

272
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,700
Her clothes are made with the finest fabrics and real Italian lace, and her face has been hand-painted by our finest artists.

273
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,320
Only $199.

274
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,419
Ooh, she's pretty.

275
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,440
I've never had a porcelain doll before.

276
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,179
I doubt Mom and Dad will get you that for your birthday.

277
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,860
She costs a pretty penny.

278
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,059
Plus, you'd most likely break her.

279
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:38,200
What is better than a board?

280
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,580
What is better than one board game?

281
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,320
Three board games in one.

282
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,360
Enjoy playing chess and checkers on this side of the board.

283
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,100
But if you're looking for some more fun, flip it and play the classic game of Sorry.

284
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,620
That's ingenious.

285
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,000
Why hasn't anyone thought of that before?

286
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,500
Now you can take SpongeBob SquarePants wherever you go with the new SpongeBob SquarePants glow in the dark yo-yo.

287
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,940
And now, back to our show.

288
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,580
Alright, so talking about toys.

289
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:14,799
These are really interesting toys.

290
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,399
Are there any specific toys that you had when you were growing up or that you really, really liked?

291
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:22,899
I had an amazing Brio train set.

292
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:28,639
This was when I was young, and a train set is basically like Legos with trains.

293
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,559
So you build a track and you push the train around the track.

294
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,399
And so I used to have a track that was as big as the living room.

295
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:45,399
And my challenge, my goal was to use every single piece, which is very hard because some pieces don't fit with other pieces.

296
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,639
And so that was my favorite toy because I got to be very creative.

297
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,620
And then you would turn on the train and it would go away.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,460
It wasn't electric, so I had to push it myself.

299
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:55,480
What was your favorite toy?

300
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,919
Actually, when I was growing up I used to collect little toy cars.

301
00:16:59,820 --> 00:16:59,980
Surprise!

302
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:10,259
I used to have a lot of little toy cars and I even had a little special box for them so I could see them.

303
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:17,019
And then as time went on I got to collect the scale cars, the ones that are 1 to 10, 1 to 4.

304
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,640
Did you build them or did you buy them made?

305
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,220
No, usually I bought them made.

306
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,259
I actually tried the whole building model cars, model airplanes, but it's so hard.

307
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:27,880
Very hard.

308
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:29,539
Even adults have a hard time with that.

309
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,859
It's very difficult, so I don't know what type of kid actually does that when they're growing up.

310
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:38,619
But yeah, so many toys out there, so many people collect them, play with them.

311
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:43,160
You have childhood toys that you're very fond of, so that's what we want to know.

312
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,519
What type of toy did you grow up with?

313
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,960
What did you like to play with when you were a kid?

314
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,079
Or if you have kids, what toys do your kids like?

315
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,960
Because we're not too familiar with toys these days, we'd be curious to hear about those.

316
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,980
That's right, so we want to hear from you.

317
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,500
Come to EnglishPod.com and we'll see everyone there.

318
00:17:59,680 --> 00:17:59,900
Bye.
