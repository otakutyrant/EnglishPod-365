00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:07,780
Good afternoon, Chloe.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,339
I'm Dr.

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:08,660
Evans.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,980
What seems to be the problem?

5
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:11,199
Hi, Dr.

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:11,580
Evans.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,080
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

8
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,480
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,460
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

10
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,859
Ah, I see.

11
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,239
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,960
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,339
Chloe, could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,780
Ah.

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,539
Good, yes.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,579
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

17
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,000
How are your ears?

18
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:37,799
Blocked at all?

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,960
A little, actually.

20
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:43,119
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

21
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,280
I really feel terrible.

22
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,280
Okay, Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,100
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

24
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,780
You don't sound too good at all.

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,780
Okay, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,700
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

27
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,859
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

28
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,840
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear up your lungs.

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,459
Whoa, so many drugs.

30
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:20,260
Ugh, I hate swallowing pills.

31
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,920
Am I able to go to work?

32
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,420
Absolutely not.

33
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,780
You're highly contagious.

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,959
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,060
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get weak and dehydrated.

36
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,920
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

37
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,599
Okay, would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,840
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,219
Haha, sure, no problem.

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,280
Here you are.

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,459
Now, off home and away to bed.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,959
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

43
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,680
Feel better soon and take care.

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,040
Thanks, doc.

45
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:55,980
Bye.

46
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:56,659
Bye.
