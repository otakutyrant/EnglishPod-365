00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good afternoon, Chloe.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Dr.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Evans.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What seems to be the problem?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hi, Dr.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Evans.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ah, I see.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Chloe, could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ah.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good, yes.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How are your ears?

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Blocked at all?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A little, actually.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I really feel terrible.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't sound too good at all.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear up your lungs.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Whoa, so many drugs.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ugh, I hate swallowing pills.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Am I able to go to work?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Absolutely not.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You're highly contagious.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get weak and dehydrated.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Haha, sure, no problem.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Here you are.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, off home and away to bed.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Feel better soon and take care.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thanks, doc.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bye.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Bye.
