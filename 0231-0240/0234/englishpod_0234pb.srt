00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and we're talking today about health and getting sick.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are going to visit the doctor, so we're feeling a little bit ill.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And we're going to describe some of the symptoms that we have, and the doctor is going to recommend some medicine.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Good afternoon, Chloe.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm Dr.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Evans.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What seems to be the problem?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi, Dr.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Evans.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ah, I see.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Ah.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good, yes.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How are your ears?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Blocked at all?

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A little, actually.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I really feel terrible.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You don't sound too good at all.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear up your lungs.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Whoa, so many drugs.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ugh, I hate swallowing pills.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Am I able to go to work?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Absolutely not, you are highly contagious.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get weak and dehydrated.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Haha, sure, no problem.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here you are.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Now, off home and away to bed.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Feel better soon and take care.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Thanks, doc.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bye.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bye.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Alright, we're back.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So now, let's take a look at six key words that we have prepared for you today on Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Language Takeaway.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So oftentimes in the wintertime when the air is very, very dry and maybe you have a cold, you get this.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is the first thing we're talking about.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We have a sore throat.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, so Chloe in the dialogue says, I woke up this morning and I had a really sore throat.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So let's take a look at those two words.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We know throat is the part of your neck, right?

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Connects your head to your body.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And the word sore.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sore means it hurts.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I could have a sore back or sore knees.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sore is basically an adjective that describes pain.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Pain.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So you have an ache in your throat.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alright, so that's a sore throat.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And well, she said that she has this sore throat and the doctor says, ah, I see.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, croaky is a way to describe the way a person sounds, especially when they're talking and maybe their voice I think is very deep or rough.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So usually if you have a sore throat or a very bad cough, you sound a little bit croaky.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So you're like, hey, my throat hurts a little bit.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Exactly.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Not a very nice way to sound.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It comes from the way that frogs croak, right?

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's the sound that frogs make.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They croak.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, yeah, sometimes when you do have a sore throat or a very bad cough, people say that you have a frog in your throat.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So that's the word croaky.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now moving on.

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you have a sore throat, it's usually because your tonsils are swollen.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the first word here, tonsils.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
These are a body part.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They're in your throat, the very back of your throat, and you usually have two of them.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Some people don't have any though.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Some people get them removed.

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're like little balls in the back of your throat.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I don't really know what they do.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think they pick up some, I don't know what they do.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't think you need them actually.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Because a lot of people have them taken out when they're young.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But tonsils, when they are infected or when they are swollen, are very, very painful.

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can have really bad sore throats.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And usually they can cause fevers and stuff like that.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So some people get them removed.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And well, as we said, your tonsils are swollen.

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So if they are swollen, that means they are big.

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So swollen means they're bigger than normal.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And you can say this about many different things.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
For example, maybe someone stepped on my toe and my toe really hurts and I looked down and it's swollen.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That means my toe got bigger.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So this is an adjective when something is swollen.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But the verb form to say that something swells, right?

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It gets bigger.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It gets bigger.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
To swell.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Or the adjective, it is swollen.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And now she was talking a little bit about her sinuses.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Her sinuses are a little blocked up.

124
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So sinuses are in your face.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You have them in your nose and under your eyes.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And when they hurt, it's actually quite painful.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And people say that sometimes their sinuses are aggravated or they have bad sinuses.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This means they're having a hard time breathing or their face is sore, their eyes are sore.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's very common.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So that's sinuses.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Isn't there actually a condition that if you have blocked sinuses all the time, they call it sinusitis?

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sinusitis.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that's a problem that comes back again and again.

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And the doctor also recommended her to rest because she is highly contagious.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So you want to stay away from people who are contagious.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This means that what disease they have or what illness they have can affect other people.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Right.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So if I have the flu, Marco, and I come to work, it's pretty contagious.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's very likely that you will get the flu.

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's right.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So a flu is very highly contagious or many other things are highly contagious.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
For example, pink eye.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is very contagious.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Very.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But you know, cancer is not contagious.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If you have cancer, I can't get it from touching you.

153
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Very good.

155
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So contagious.

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All right.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why don't we go back and listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a little bit to talk about Fluency Builder.

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good afternoon, Chloe.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm Dr.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Evans.

161
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What seems to be the problem?

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hi, Dr.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Evans.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ah, I see.

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

171
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ah.

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good, yes.

173
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How are your ears?

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Blocked at all?

176
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
A little, actually.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I really feel terrible.

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ah.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ah.

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You don't sound too good at all.

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

185
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear up your lungs.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Whoa, so many drugs.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Ugh, I hate swallowing pills.

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Am I able to go to work?

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Absolutely not.

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You are highly contagious.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get weak and dehydrated.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Haha, sure, no problem.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Here you are.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now, off home and away to bed.

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Feel better soon and take care.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Thanks, doc.

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Bye.

206
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Bye.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at four key phrases that we have prepared for you on Fluency Builder.

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Fluency Builder.

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So Chloe goes in to see her doctor, Dr.

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Evans, and she says, thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What's short notice?

212
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All right, so basically, Chloe made an appointment with the doctor very late or very suddenly.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So that's a short notice.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Great, so for example, it's Friday night and she needs to make an appointment for Saturday morning.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's pretty short notice.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's not calling the doctor in advance.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can say this also when you're talking to friends.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know, I'm really sorry to cancel on such short notice, but I can't go to dinner tonight.

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right, so I think it's very interesting, the whole structure, as you see, on such short notice.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So as you said, your example, I'm really sorry to cancel on such short notice.

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
On short notice.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
On such short notice.

223
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's right.

224
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right, so moving on to her second phrase, Chloe was explaining that she doesn't feel very well and she said, I think I'm coming down with the flu.

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, so let's look at this verbal phrase here, coming down with.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, so you can come down with many different illnesses, but the verb here means, this is the beginning of my illness.

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So I'm starting to feel the effects, like you said, Marco.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm feeling some symptoms.

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So I'm starting to get sick, right?

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm coming down with a fever.

231
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Or I think I'm coming down with a cold.

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Very common.

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All right.

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And the doctor started to check Chloe, how she was breathing, and I think he listened to her lungs with his, what is it called, a stethoscope.

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stethoscope.

236
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Stethoscope.

237
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And he said, wow, you are really all bunged up.

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
All right, so here he's basically saying that she's very congested.

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That means that her breathing passageways, like in her nose and her throat and her chest, are very stuffy.

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's things in them, usually mucus and phlegm.

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
These are things that, you know what's in your nose when you have a cold and you have to blow it out?

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's phlegm and mucus.

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, not a very pretty thing.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No, very disgusting, actually.

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So maybe we should move on to our next item.

246
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
All right, so she's all bunged up and a clear up.

247
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And so he recommended a couple of different medicines, such as antibiotics, some pills, and he also gave her an inhaler to clear up her lungs.

248
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay, so an inhaler is basically a device that you use to put steroids in your lungs that will help you breathe.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So some people, when they're running or they're walking, they're very short of breath and they can't breathe.

250
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, there's a problem with this, like asthma, and they need to breathe this little inhaler.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's like a little tube.

252
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think it's you inhale medicine from this little tube.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, so the medicine helps open up your passageways.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It helps you breathe, and it's very important for some people.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But in the case of an illness, like your lungs are very congested, this helps you breathe on the short term.

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Right, so basically clear up is to allow air or the movement of something within your body usually, I think.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Right, but to clear up isn't necessarily about air.

258
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's basically a way to say that it will make this problem go away.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
To clear something up is to make the problem go.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Right, so I guess if you get medicine from a doctor, he'll say, okay, this will help you clear up your throat.

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Right, or if you have a problem with acne, maybe your doctor will give you some cream to help clear up your acne, make it go away.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Clear up your skin.

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay, so a lot of great examples there.

264
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue one last time?

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Good afternoon, Chloe.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm Dr.

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Evans.

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What seems to be the problem?

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hi, Dr.

270
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Evans.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes.

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
When I woke up this morning, I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough.

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Ah, I see.

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, you do sound rather croaky.

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Could you please open your mouth and say, ah?

279
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Ah.

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Good, yes.

281
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your tonsils are a little swollen and red.

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
How are your ears?

283
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Blocked at all?

284
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A little, actually.

285
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
My sinuses are a little blocked up as well.

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I really feel terrible.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, Chloe.

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest?

289
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Wow, you really are all bunged up.

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't sound too good at all.

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics.

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening.

293
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals.

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless, just to clear up your lungs.

295
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Whoa, so many drugs.

296
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ugh, I hate swallowing pills.

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Am I able to go to work?

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Absolutely not.

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You are highly contagious.

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers, do you?

301
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get weak and dehydrated.

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies.

303
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

304
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work?

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Otherwise, they may think I'm faking it.

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Haha, sure, no problem.

307
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Here you are.

308
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now, off home and away to bed.

309
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you have any questions, just give me a call.

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Feel better soon and take care.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Thanks, doc.

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Bye.

313
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Bye.

314
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
All right, so talking about illnesses and being contagious.

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We mentioned this pink eye illness before.

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So this is the colloquial way of saying conjunctivitis, which is, I don't know if anyone has ever gotten it, your eye gets very, very red for a prolonged period of time.

317
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's right.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And it itches a lot.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It itches.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And so already your eye is very red or very pink, like the name says, but you really want to scratch it and itch it, and it's really hard not to.

321
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah.

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And I think you treat it by means of some eye drops.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

324
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And you have to wait.

325
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I actually had a very bad case of pink eye once that I couldn't just clear up with drops.

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The doctor gave me some eye drops.

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They were so strong that I put them in my eye and I can taste them.

328
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, wow.

329
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah.

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So apparently it's very strange and it wouldn't clear up.

331
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So then I had to get some kind of like a clear gel put in my eye and my eye patched up for like two days.

332
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, wow.

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah.

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I was running around with one eye.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It was crazy.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, I've never had it.

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But I know that it's very, very contagious, like we were saying earlier.

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And so if a student at a school gets pink eye, all the parents get very nervous because it's very, very likely that he or she will give it to another person.

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because, you know, kids, if you touch your eye and you touch someone else, all of a sudden they have this disease.

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Exactly.

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So, yeah, it's very common thing.

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And I think especially with kids, they always get all these things, pink eye, measles.

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
They get chicken pox, chicken pox, a lot of different diseases.

345
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
