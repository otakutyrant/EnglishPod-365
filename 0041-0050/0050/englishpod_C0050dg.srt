EnglishPod.com Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,740
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

4
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,880
It would be my pleasure.

5
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,560
Please have a seat.

6
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:42,520
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

7
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,979
We would love some.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,359
Here you are.

9
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:52,700
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

10
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:58,500
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

11
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
Mmm, it's delicious.

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,400
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

13
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,000
Almost tastes like...

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,000
Like...

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,239
Ellen?

16
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,000
Ellen!

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,560
Are you okay?

18
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:12,400
Did she pass out?

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,280
Yeah.

20
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,519
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,980
You'll ruin our meal.

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,120
Ha ha ha ha.
