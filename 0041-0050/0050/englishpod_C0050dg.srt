EnglishPod.com Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It would be my pleasure.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Please have a seat.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We would love some.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here you are.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Mmm, it's delicious.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Almost tastes like...

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
like...

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Ellen?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ellen!

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Are you okay?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Did she pass out?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You'll ruin our meal.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hahahaha.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thanks for watching!
