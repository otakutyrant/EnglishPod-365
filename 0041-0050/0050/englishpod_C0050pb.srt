00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:03,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:10,580
And we're bringing you the third part of our Suspend series of New Guy in Town.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,279
That's right.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,619
What's going to happen today?

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,599
Well, I don't know.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,720
There's still so many things that could happen.

9
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,399
This guy is kind of weird, right?

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,300
Is he a vampire?

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,980
Like, what's going on?

12
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:27,140
Yeah, and I would like to thank all of our listeners for contributing and sending out their ideas of what they think happens in this third part.

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,539
Yeah, I especially like the story about the rabbit.

14
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:30,820
Yeah, the rabbit.

15
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,699
That was a good one.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,799
As promised, we took the idea of one of our listeners and created the dialogue around it.

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,659
And this time it was a contribution of Babar Dawan.

18
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,880
Yeah, he gave us a great idea for this dialogue.

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,460
Exactly.

20
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,920
He gave us a really good idea, so thank you Babar.

21
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,640
And this one is for you.

22
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:51,000
In this dialogue we're going to be looking at some hospitality vocabulary.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,640
Yeah, some phrases you can use when you welcome someone to your house.

24
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,299
Alright, well, we've got some language to preview, so let's turn now to vocabulary preview.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,200
Vocabulary preview.

26
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,579
On vocabulary preview we have the word appetite.

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,579
Appetite.

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:08,680
Appetite.

29
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:09,299
Appetite.

30
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,400
So, Erika, tell us about appetite.

31
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:17,040
When you have an appetite, you're hungry, or you have a desire to eat food, right?

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,879
Alright, so you can have a big appetite, a small appetite.

33
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,420
Really hungry, a little bit hungry.

34
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,959
Okay.

35
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,799
Let's look at our next word.

36
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:27,760
Poison.

37
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:28,519
Poison.

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,359
So poison could be a noun or a verb.

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:31,900
Exactly.

40
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:41,480
So when you poison someone, you put something in their food or maybe in their drink that makes them really sick and maybe even makes them die.

41
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,579
Okay, so to poison somebody.

42
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:43,859
Yep.

43
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:47,900
And the noun is actually the thing that you put inside the food or drink.

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,060
So usually poison is some sort of chemical substance.

45
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,379
Yes.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Snakes, for example, have poison.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah, in their teeth.

48
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:58,079
Right, so if you get bitten by a snake.

49
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,359
You'll get poisoned.

50
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:00,239
You'll get poisoned.

51
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:05,299
Alright, so let's take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see why we are talking about poison.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,579
And we'll come back and explain some great words.

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,240
Please make yourselves at home.

54
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,180
Let me take your coats.

55
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:26,639
Dinner's almost ready.

56
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:28,580
I hope you brought your appetite.

57
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:30,919
Your house is lovely, Armand.

58
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:32,960
Very interesting decor.

59
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:34,960
Very gothic.

60
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,240
I think it's amazing.

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,900
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

62
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,159
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,939
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

64
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,020
It would be my pleasure.

65
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,699
Please have a seat.

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,659
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,120
We would love some.

68
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,379
Here you are.

69
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,840
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,780
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

71
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,120
Mmm, it's delicious.

72
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,520
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

73
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,840
Almost tastes like...

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,120
Like...

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,379
Ellen?

76
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,139
Ellen!

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,699
Are you okay?

78
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,520
Did she pass out?

79
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:21,400
Yeah.

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,639
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,099
You'll ruin our meal.

82
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:29,939
Hahahahaha!

83
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,319
Okay, so that was unexpected.

84
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,020
I know.

85
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,500
Lois, can you believe it?

86
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,819
Apparently, Lois is helping Armand.

87
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,439
I know.

88
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,659
Maybe she's a vampire.

89
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,500
Alright, well I really wonder what's going to happen next.

90
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,259
We'll see what happens next.

91
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,120
But now let's take a look at some of the language in Language Takeaway.

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,439
Alright, so we have a couple of words in Language Takeaway today.

93
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,520
Let's start off with pointers.

94
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,680
Pointers.

95
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,900
Pointers.

96
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,500
Pointers.

97
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,490
So to give somebody pointers.

98
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,079
You give them some suggestions.

99
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,540
Suggestions or tips.

100
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,139
Exactly.

101
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,480
Alright, so suggestions or tips.

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
Let's listen to some examples of how you would use it.

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,339
I want to dance salsa better.

104
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:31,800
Can you give me a few pointers?

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,939
I need some pointers on how to be a better manager.

106
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,660
Let me give you a few pointers so you can pass your exam.

107
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:58,800
Alright, so pointers.

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,699
It's clear now.

109
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,519
Let's take a look at our next word.

110
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:02,480
Aroma.

111
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:03,319
Aroma.

112
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:04,459
Aroma.

113
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:05,120
Aroma.

114
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,019
This is a nice round word, isn't it?

115
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,540
Aroma.

116
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,060
Yeah.

117
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:11,660
Well, this word makes you sound really educated.

118
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,019
Yeah.

119
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,920
Basically, it means?

120
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:14,560
Smell.

121
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:15,060
Smell.

122
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:15,399
Yep.

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,139
So you could say, for example, this coffee has a great aroma.

124
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:24,319
Or maybe this perfume has the aroma of roses and lavender.

125
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,000
Nice.

126
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,399
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

127
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,579
B-I-T-T-E-R.

128
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:31,980
Bitter.

129
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,480
Okay, bitter.

130
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,920
So bitter is the opposite of?

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,040
Of sweet.

132
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,879
So it's always hard to describe taste, isn't it?

133
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,240
Yeah.

134
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,399
But maybe we can say a few foods that are bitter.

135
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,060
Okay.

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
So chocolate, when it has no sugar, is bitter.

137
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,100
Okay.

138
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,860
Or, for example, coffee without any sugar is also bitter.

139
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,060
Yeah, and sometimes red wine can be quite bitter.

140
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,759
So bitter.

141
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,959
Okay, and now let's take a look at our last word.

142
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,100
Pass out.

143
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:00,980
Pass out.

144
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,180
Pass out.

145
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,819
Pass out.

146
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,319
It seems kind of easy.

147
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,100
Pass and out.

148
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:06,439
Yep.

149
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
But it means something different.

150
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:08,560
Yeah, when you put them together.

151
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,720
What does it mean?

152
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,759
It means faint or become unconscious.

153
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:14,600
Okay.

154
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:22,120
So imagine someone when, you know, they're standing up and then suddenly they start to move around and then fall over to the ground.

155
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,699
Okay, pass out.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,079
Yes.

157
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,519
This usually happens when you get really, really drunk.

158
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:29,819
Maybe sometimes also when maybe you're pregnant, you might pass out.

159
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,240
Right.

160
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,379
Okay, to lose consciousness.

161
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:32,959
Yes.

162
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:37,019
Marco and I have a couple of examples of this word for you.

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,819
Example one.

164
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,980
I drank so much last night that I passed out at my friend's house.

165
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,399
Example two.

166
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,399
She was standing in the sun too long, so she passed out right in front of me.

167
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,420
Example three.

168
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,160
My sister passes out whenever she sees blood.

169
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,319
Alright, so let's listen to our dialogue again now.

170
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,899
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

171
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,879
And you'll be able to hear these words that we just talked about.

172
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:24,519
Please make yourselves at home.

173
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,660
Let me take your coats.

174
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,060
Dinner is almost ready.

175
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,240
I hope you brought your appetite.

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,180
Your house is lovely, Armand.

177
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,379
Very interesting decor.

178
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,019
Very gothic.

179
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,560
I think it's amazing.

180
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,639
You have such good taste, Armand.

181
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,899
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

182
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:51,279
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

183
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,079
It would be my pleasure.

184
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,160
Please have a seat.

185
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,860
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

186
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,980
We would love some.

187
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,279
Here you are.

188
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,639
A very special Merlot brought directly from my home country.

189
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,060
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and superior flavor.

190
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,279
Mmm, it's delicious.

191
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:20,480
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

192
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:23,279
Almost tastes like...

193
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:23,900
like...

194
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:24,759
Ellen?

195
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,040
Ellen?

196
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,699
Are you okay?

197
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,240
Did she pass out?

198
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,439
Yeah.

199
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,440
I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much.

200
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,259
You'll ruin our meal.

201
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,840
Alright, so interesting story.

202
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes.

203
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,500
We have some great phrases that we've used here.

204
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,139
So let's take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

205
00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:00,960
Fluency Builder We've got four phrases for you that are great to use when you want to welcome someone into your house or into your office or anywhere, really.

206
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:01,919
Exactly.

207
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,360
So why don't we take a look at the first one?

208
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,740
Please make yourselves at home.

209
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,639
Please make yourselves at home.

210
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,879
Please make yourselves at home.

211
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,740
So this is a very common phrase when you invite somebody to your house.

212
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:15,279
Yeah.

213
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:16,740
You always use this phrase.

214
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:16,980
Yeah.

215
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,340
It's like make yourself comfortable, relaxed, sit down.

216
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:23,100
Yeah.

217
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,100
Don't worry about it.

218
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,059
Like, my house is your house.

219
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,500
Exactly.

220
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,159
Please make yourself at home.

221
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,259
Okay.

222
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,820
Good one.

223
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:36,980
Usually people arrive to a party or to a dinner with jackets, coats, scarves, all that stuff.

224
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
So this next phrase is really handy.

225
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,679
Let me take your coats.

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,220
Let me take your coats.

227
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,419
Let me take your coats.

228
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:46,759
So that means give me your coats and I'll put them in the closet.

229
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:49,399
Let me take your coats.

230
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,559
And then a good host would always offer a drink, right?

231
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:55,500
Exactly.

232
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,000
Water or in this case, wine.

233
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,399
So they would say, can I offer you a glass of wine?

234
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,820
Or sometimes you could say, can I offer you a glass?

235
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,220
Can I offer you something to drink?

236
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah.

237
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,580
So can I offer you a glass of wine?

238
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,379
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

239
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,559
You offer me a glass of wine.

240
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,320
I say, yeah, sure.

241
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,659
I'll take a glass of wine.

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,139
All right.

243
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,039
And then I would use our next phrase.

244
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,159
Here you are.

245
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,259
Here you are.

246
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,220
Here you are.

247
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:24,960
Exactly.

248
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,360
It doesn't mean that you are here.

249
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:26,799
No.

250
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,779
It's saying to someone, here it is.

251
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,379
Take it.

252
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:30,659
Yes.

253
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,100
Yes.

254
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,379
Right?

255
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:31,899
You know what?

256
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,659
This is a really, really great phrase.

257
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,259
A lot of people who are learning English don't say this, but it's really common, really natural.

258
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,379
If you use it, you'll sound really great.

259
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,620
Here you are.

260
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,000
Exactly.

261
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,039
Here you are.

262
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,240
You can use this anytime you give someone something.

263
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:46,659
Right.

264
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,960
So if you give somebody a pen or a pencil, a notebook, here you are.

265
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:50,639
Here it is.

266
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:50,960
Yep.

267
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:51,940
Okay.

268
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,320
Great words.

269
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,059
So let's listen to our dialogue one more time, and then we'll come back.

270
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,960
Please make yourselves at home.

271
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:15,899
Let me take your coats.

272
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:18,360
Dinner's almost ready.

273
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,299
I hope you brought your appetite.

274
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,539
Your house is lovely, Armand.

275
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,659
Very interesting decor.

276
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,679
Very gothic.

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,940
I think it's amazing.

278
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,799
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

279
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,860
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

280
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:36,600
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

281
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,720
It would be my pleasure.

282
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,440
Please have a seat.

283
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,419
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

284
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,940
We would love some.

285
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,299
Here you are.

286
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,559
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

287
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:58,419
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

288
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,639
Mmm.

289
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,820
It's delicious.

290
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,259
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

291
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,440
Almost tastes like, like...

292
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:08,860
Ellen?

293
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,460
Are you okay?

294
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,379
Did she pass out?

295
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,379
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

296
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,000
You'll ruin our meal.

297
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,399
Okay, so Armand is a pretty good host.

298
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,440
He offered them a Merlot.

299
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,320
Yeah, which is a type of wine.

300
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,080
A type of wine.

301
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,879
And this is really interesting because there are many types of wines.

302
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:43,419
Yes.

303
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:44,120
Do you know any?

304
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,120
I know a lot.

305
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,039
Alright, so give us some pointers here.

306
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,200
Alright, Merlot is probably like the most common red wine, right?

307
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,419
And Merlot is actually the grape variety.

308
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,600
The grape variety.

309
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,940
Varietal, as it's called in wine speak.

310
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,019
Wow, varietal.

311
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:58,460
Yeah.

312
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,299
Well, right now I'm really liking to drink Tempranillo, which is a Spanish wine.

313
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,059
Tempranillo?

314
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,379
Yeah.

315
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,259
Really?

316
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,460
And is that also the type of grape?

317
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,980
Yes.

318
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:08,879
Oh, nice.

319
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,840
Usually we would say red wine or white wine, right?

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,740
But the varieties, depending on the grapes, is what gives them their names.

321
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,639
So we also have a couple of other, like maybe you have a Chardonnay.

322
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,519
White wine.

323
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:21,440
White wine.

324
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,559
You have a Cabernet Sauvignon.

325
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,279
Red wine.

326
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,240
Red wine again.

327
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,120
And my personal favorite is a Carminare.

328
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,740
Oh yeah, that's a nice one.

329
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,460
That's a nice one.

330
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,679
And it's not very common anymore.

331
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,899
Apparently the grape isn't growing very well in France anymore or in Spain.

332
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:42,360
So from what I understand, it's only in Chile and Argentina, but it's a really good one.

333
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,879
Actually, Argentina makes really good Carminares.

334
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:44,419
Yeah.

335
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,179
But you know who else makes good wine?

336
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:46,639
Who?

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,399
Canadians.

338
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:47,899
Really?

339
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,379
Yes.

340
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:49,460
Canadian wine.

341
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:49,820
Yeah.

342
00:13:50,220 --> 00:14:02,019
You almost never find it outside of Canada, but there is one region in the western part of the country that makes really, really good wines, especially some nice Pinot noirs and some good white wines.

343
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,399
Okanagan Valley.

344
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,139
Check it out.

345
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,159
Yeah.

346
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:10,379
Alright, well what about in your countries do you produce any wine or maybe any other type of drink?

347
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes.

348
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,379
Right?

349
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,559
Many countries have their own types of drinks, so we want to know about it.

350
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,039
Tell us.

351
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,379
And many countries have different traditions to be hospitable, to be welcoming.

352
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, that's a good one.

353
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,159
So visit our website, EnglishPod.com.

357

Bye.
