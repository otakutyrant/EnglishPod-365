00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And we're bringing you the third part of our Suspend series of New Guy in Town.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's going to happen today?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, I don't know.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
There's still so many things that could happen.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This guy is kind of weird, right?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is he a vampire?

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Like, what's going on?

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, and I would like to thank all of our listeners for contributing and sending out their ideas of what they think happens in this third part.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, I especially like the story about the rabbit.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, the rabbit.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That was a good one.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As promised, we took the idea of one of our listeners and created the dialogue around it.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And this time it was a contribution of Babar Dawan.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, he gave us a great idea for this dialogue.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Exactly.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He gave us a really good idea, so thank you Babar.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And this one is for you.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
In this dialogue we're going to be looking at some hospitality vocabulary.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, some phrases you can use when you welcome someone to your house.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Alright, well, we've got some language to preview, so let's turn now to vocabulary preview.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Vocabulary preview.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
On vocabulary preview we have the word appetite.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Appetite.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Appetite.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Appetite.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, Erika, tell us about appetite.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When you have an appetite, you're hungry, or you have a desire to eat food, right?

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, so you can have a big appetite, a small appetite.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really hungry, a little bit hungry.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's look at our next word.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Poison.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Poison.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So poison could be a noun or a verb.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Exactly.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So when you poison someone, you put something in their food or maybe in their drink that makes them really sick and maybe even makes them die.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, so to poison somebody.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yep.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the noun is actually the thing that you put inside the food or drink.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So usually poison is some sort of chemical substance.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Snakes, for example, have poison.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, in their teeth.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Right, so if you get bitten by a snake.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You'll get poisoned.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You'll get poisoned.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, so let's take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see why we are talking about poison.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And we'll come back and explain some great words.

53
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please make yourselves at home.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let me take your coats.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Dinner's almost ready.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I hope you brought your appetite.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Your house is lovely, Armand.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Very interesting decor.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Very gothic.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I think it's amazing.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It would be my pleasure.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Please have a seat.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We would love some.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Here you are.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mmm, it's delicious.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Almost tastes like...

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Like...

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ellen?

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ellen!

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are you okay?

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Did she pass out?

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You'll ruin our meal.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hahahahaha!

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so that was unexpected.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I know.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Lois!

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Can you believe it?

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Apparently, Lois is helping Armand.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I know.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Maybe she's a vampire.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Alright, well I really wonder what's going to happen next.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We'll see what happens next.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But now let's take a look at some of the language in Language Takeaway.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Alright, so we have a couple of words in Language Takeaway today.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's start off with pointers.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Pointers.

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Pointers.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Pointers.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So to give somebody pointers.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You give them some suggestions.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Suggestions or tips.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Exactly.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Alright, so suggestions or tips.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's listen to some examples of how you would use it.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to dance salsa better.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Can you give me a few pointers?

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I need some pointers on how to be a better manager.

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let me give you a few pointers so you can pass your exam.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Alright, so pointers.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's clear now.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's take a look at our next word.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Aroma.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Aroma.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Aroma.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Aroma.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is a nice round word, isn't it?

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Aroma.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, this word makes you sound really educated.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Basically, it means?

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Smell.

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Smell.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yep.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So you could say, for example, this coffee has a great aroma.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Or maybe this perfume has the aroma of roses and lavender.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Nice.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
B-I-T-T-E-R.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bitter.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, bitter.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So bitter is the opposite of?

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of sweet.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So it's always hard to describe taste, isn't it?

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But maybe we can say a few foods that are bitter.

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay.

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So chocolate, when it has no sugar, is bitter.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Or, for example, coffee without any sugar is also bitter.

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, and sometimes red wine can be quite bitter.

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So bitter.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, and now let's take a look at our last word.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Pass out.

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Pass out.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Pass out.

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Pass out.

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It seems kind of easy.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Pass and out.

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yep.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But it means something different.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, when you put them together.

152
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What does it mean?

153
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It means faint or become unconscious.

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So imagine someone when, you know, they're standing up and then suddenly they start to move around and then fall over to the ground.

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, pass out.

157
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This usually happens when you get really, really drunk.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe sometimes also when maybe you're pregnant, you might pass out.

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, to lose consciousness.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Marco and I have a couple of examples of this word for you.

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Example one.

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I drank so much last night that I passed out at my friend's house.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Example two.

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
She was standing in the sun too long, so she passed out right in front of me.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Example three.

169
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My sister passes out whenever she sees blood.

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Alright, so let's listen to our dialogue again now.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And you'll be able to hear these words that we just talked about.

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please make yourselves at home.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let me take your coats.

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Dinner is almost ready.

176
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I hope you brought your appetite.

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Your house is lovely, Armand.

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Very interesting decor.

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Very gothic.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think it's amazing.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have such good taste, Armand.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It would be my pleasure.

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Please have a seat.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

187
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We would love some.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Here you are.

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A very special Merlot brought directly from my home country.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and superior flavor.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mmm, it's delicious.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Almost tastes like...

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
like...

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ellen?

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ellen?

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you okay?

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Did she pass out?

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much.

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You'll ruin our meal.

202
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Alright, so interesting story.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We have some great phrases that we've used here.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So let's take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Fluency Builder We've got four phrases for you that are great to use when you want to welcome someone into your house or into your office or anywhere, really.

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Exactly.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So why don't we take a look at the first one?

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please make yourselves at home.

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please make yourselves at home.

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Please make yourselves at home.

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So this is a very common phrase when you invite somebody to your house.

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah.

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You always use this phrase.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah.

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's like make yourself comfortable, relaxed, sit down.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't worry about it.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like, my house is your house.

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Exactly.

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Please make yourself at home.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Good one.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Usually people arrive to a party or to a dinner with jackets, coats, scarves, all that stuff.

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So this next phrase is really handy.

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let me take your coats.

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let me take your coats.

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let me take your coats.

229
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So that means give me your coats and I'll put them in the closet.

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let me take your coats.

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then a good host would always offer a drink, right?

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Exactly.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Water or in this case, wine.

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So they would say, can I offer you a glass of wine?

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Or sometimes you could say, can I offer you a glass?

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Can I offer you something to drink?

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So can I offer you a glass of wine?

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You offer me a glass of wine.

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I say, yeah, sure.

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll take a glass of wine.

243
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All right.

244
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And then I would use our next phrase.

245
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Here you are.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Here you are.

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Here you are.

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Exactly.

249
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It doesn't mean that you are here.

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No.

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's saying to someone, here it is.

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Take it.

253
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

255
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right?

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know what?

257
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This is a really, really great phrase.

258
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A lot of people who are learning English don't say this, but it's really common, really natural.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you use it, you'll sound really great.

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Here you are.

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Exactly.

262
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Here you are.

263
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can use this anytime you give someone something.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Right.

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So if you give somebody a pen or a pencil, a notebook, here you are.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Here it is.

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yep.

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Great words.

270
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So let's listen to our dialogue one more time, and then we'll come back.

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please make yourselves at home.

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let me take your coats.

273
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Dinner's almost ready.

274
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I hope you brought your appetite.

275
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Your house is lovely, Armand.

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Very interesting decor.

277
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Very gothic.

278
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I think it's amazing.

279
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, you have such good taste, Armand.

280
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm thinking of redecorating my house.

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Maybe you could give me a few pointers?

282
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It would be my pleasure.

283
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Please have a seat.

284
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can I offer you a glass of wine?

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We would love some.

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Here you are.

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A very special Merlot, brought directly from my home country.

288
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It has a unique ingredient, which gives it a pleasant aroma and a superior flavor.

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Mmm.

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's delicious.

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a bit bitter for my taste.

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Almost tastes like, like...

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Ellen?

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you okay?

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Did she pass out?

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I hope you didn't poison her drink too much.

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You'll ruin our meal.

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Okay, so Armand is a pretty good host.

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
He offered them a Merlot.

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, which is a type of wine.

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
A type of wine.

302
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And this is really interesting because there are many types of wines.

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Do you know any?

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I know a lot.

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Alright, so give us some pointers here.

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Alright, Merlot is probably like the most common red wine, right?

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And Merlot is actually the grape variety.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The grape variety.

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Varietal, as it's called in wine speak.

311
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wow, varietal.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah.

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, right now I'm really liking to drink Tempranillo, which is a Spanish wine.

314
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Tempranillo?

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah.

316
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Really?

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And is that also the type of grape?

318
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, nice.

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Usually we would say red wine or white wine, right?

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But the varieties, depending on the grapes, is what gives them their names.

322
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So we also have a couple of other, like maybe you have a Chardonnay.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
White wine.

324
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
White wine.

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You have a Cabernet Sauvignon.

326
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Red wine.

327
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Red wine again.

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And my personal favorite is a Carminare.

329
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh yeah, that's a nice one.

330
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's a nice one.

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And it's not very common anymore.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Apparently the grape isn't growing very well in France anymore or in Spain.

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So from what I understand, it's only in Chile and Argentina, but it's a really good one.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Actually, Argentina makes really good Carminares.

335
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But you know who else makes good wine?

337
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who?

338
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Canadians.

339
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Really?

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

341
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Canadian wine.

342
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah.

343
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You almost never find it outside of Canada, but there is one region in the western part of the country that makes really, really good wines, especially some nice Pinot noirs and some good white wines.

344
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okanagan Valley.

345
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Check it out.

346
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

347
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Alright, well what about in your countries do you produce any wine or maybe any other type of drink?

348
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes.

349
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Right?

350
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Many countries have their own types of drinks, so we want to know about it.

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Tell us.

352
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And many countries have different traditions to be hospitable, to be welcoming.

353
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, that's a good one.

354
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So visit our website, EnglishPod.com.
