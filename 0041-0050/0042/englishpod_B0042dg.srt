00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:12,859
So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:16,859
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,460
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,920
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

5
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,160
Why are things delayed?

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,320
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,460
I'm not looking for excuses here.

8
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,100
I just want to get this finished on time.

9
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:41,799
I know, and I apologize for the delay, but some things were just beyond my control.

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,820
I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,320
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

13
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,840
I want those photos ASAP.
