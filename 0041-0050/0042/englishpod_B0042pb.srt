00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today with Erica, we're bringing you a great lesson about time.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You need more of it.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We need more time, right?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we're going to be teaching you how you can ask for more time.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you're working on a project at work and you can't finish it on time, you have to ask your boss for more time.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Right.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
All right.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So today in our dialogue, Casey needs more time to put together a press kit.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What's a press kit?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good question.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A press kit is something the marketing department will put together, basically pictures, logos, information about the company.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So when a newspaper or a magazine wants to write an article about them, so they have something already prepared that they could give the newspaper or magazine.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit difficult to understand.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We'll come back in one minute and tell you about some of the key language.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are things delayed?

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm not looking for excuses here.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just want to get this finished on time.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And I apologize for the delay, but some things were just beyond my control.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I want those photos ASAP.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, so Casey is in trouble, I think.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, I think her boss is pretty upset.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, let's take a look at some of the language that we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
First word today is deadline.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Deadline.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Deadline.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So, Erika, what's a deadline?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It is the last possible date to do something.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So for example, when we were in school, our teacher would send us homework and say it was for Friday.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So the deadline was Friday.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Was Friday, right?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Or when you're at work, you have projects that you have to finish by a certain date.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's your deadline.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Extension.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Extension.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Extension.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, extension and deadline go together, right?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Exactly.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you can't reach your deadline or you can't make your deadline, you must ask for an extension.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
An extension.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So you ask for more time.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, an extension is moving the deadline in the future.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Alright, interesting.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's look at our next word.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ran into.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Ran into.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ran into.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ran into some problems.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we ran into some problems in this dialogue.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's listen to some more examples of run into so we can understand the meaning.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Example one.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We ran into a storm on our way home.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Example two.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you're not careful now, you're going to run into a lot of problems later.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Example three.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I ran into some trouble with my computer.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, good example.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So it's clear now, right?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you run into problems, you meet some problems.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Many students say it in that way.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I met some problems.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, but that's wrong.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So you would say I ran into some problems.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I met some problems is wrong, wrong, wrong.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, don't say met some problems.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I ran into some problems.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I ran into.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And our last word for language takeaway.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Delayed.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Delayed.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Delayed.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Delayed.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So when something is delayed, it's...

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Late.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And the opposite is...

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
On time.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So your flight was delayed.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Or your flight was on time.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The project was delayed.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Or your project was on time.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Clear.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All right.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So now let's go back to the dialogue.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's listen to it again.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And this time it will be a little bit slower so you can understand some of these phrases we just talked about.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Why are things delayed?

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not looking for excuses here.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I just want to get this finished on time.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I apologize for the delay.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But some things were just beyond my control.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I had trouble booking the photographer.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And then Michael was sick for three weeks so I couldn't include him in the photos.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I want those photos ASAP.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, so there were some really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, some wonderful phrases that you can use when you want to ask for more time.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, so let's look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Alright, what's our first phrase?

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've been meaning to talk to you.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've been meaning to.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've been meaning to.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, we have some really great examples of how you can combine I've been meaning to with different verbs.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, let's listen.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Example one.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry I haven't called you yet.

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been meaning to, but I've been busy.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Example two.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've been meaning to tell you, but John quit yesterday.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Example three.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've been meaning to see that film for a while.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been meaning to go to that restaurant, but I haven't had time.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So you've been wanting to for a long time.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've been thinking about it.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've been planning to do it, but you just haven't done it.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I haven't done it because I haven't had time or money.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, good phrase.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Our next phrase is beyond my control.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Beyond my control.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's beyond my control.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So it means that I can't control it.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You can't do anything about it.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Can't do anything about it.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The weather is beyond my control.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Right.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Or relate with this project because Jane was sick for one month.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It was beyond my control.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It wasn't your fault.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And our last phrase for Fluency Builder, put this off.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Put this off.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Put this off.

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Put this off.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So let's listen to some more examples of put this off before we explain the meaning.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Example one.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I've been putting off this project for a week and it's due tomorrow.

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Example two.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Can we put off our meeting until next week?

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm too busy right now.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Example three.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've been putting off my email all day.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And now I have 50 messages to respond to.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So Marco, when you put something off, you...

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Leave it for later.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right?

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So maybe I have to write a report today, but I'm going to put it off till tomorrow.

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So you're going to do it tomorrow.

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll do it tomorrow.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, so we've seen some really great words and some really good phrases.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk some more.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why are things delayed?

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm not looking for excuses here.

187
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I just want to get this finished on time.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I know, and I apologize for the delay, but some things were just beyond my control.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I want those photos ASAP.

193
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, Marco, do you think that Casey's reasons for being late are good?

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I think so, because it wasn't really her fault, the whole situation with the photographer, and then one of her co-workers was sick for three weeks.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not really her fault, right?

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But maybe the boss thinks that she's making excuses.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Maybe she's making excuses.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's really common.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Like, for example, when we were kids, you would say, oh, my dog ate my homework.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right, but that really happened to me once.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your dog ate your homework?

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
My cat ate my homework.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Your cat ate your homework?

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And what did your teacher say?

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, actually, I was a really good student, so my teacher believed me.

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, my teacher wouldn't have believed me.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Really?

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No, no, she would have called my parents, most likely.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
My cat really did eat my homework, and I just left it on the table, and it chewed it all up.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's weird.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Why would your cat do that?

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know.

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
A lot of weird excuses out there.

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I was abducted by aliens.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Uh-huh.

217
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My mom accidentally mailed my homework to Africa.

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This happened to you?

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Creative writing.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Creative excuses.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, I want to hear from our listeners.

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I want to know what excuses they've used for being late with something.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So send us your excuses.

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And this is an elementary lesson, right?

229

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Bye-bye.
