00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,540
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,459
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,199
And today with Erica, we're bringing you a great lesson about time.

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,300
You need more of it.

7
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,759
We need more time, right?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,980
So we're going to be teaching you how you can ask for more time.

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,460
If you're working on a project at work and you can't finish it on time, you have to ask your boss for more time.

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,140
Right.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,280
All right.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,280
So today in our dialogue, Casey needs more time to put together a press kit.

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,100
What's a press kit?

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,240
Good question.

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:41,159
A press kit is something the marketing department will put together, basically pictures, logos, information about the company.

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:48,659
So when a newspaper or a magazine wants to write an article about them, so they have something already prepared that they could give the newspaper or magazine.

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,299
Okay.

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,140
Okay.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,399
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,219
And as always, it's going to be at a normal speed, so it might be a little bit difficult to understand.

21
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,179
We'll come back in one minute and tell you about some of the key language.

22
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,939
So Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

23
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,939
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,599
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

25
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,019
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

26
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,239
Why are things delayed?

27
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,439
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,560
I'm not looking for excuses here.

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,200
I just want to get this finished on time.

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,200
I know.

31
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,900
And I apologize for the delay, but some things were just beyond my control.

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,920
I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos.

33
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:58,379
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

34
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,379
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

35
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,959
I want those photos ASAP.

36
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,439
All right, so Casey is in trouble, I think.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
Yeah, I think her boss is pretty upset.

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,680
Yeah.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,639
Well, let's take a look at some of the language that we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:27,419
First word today is deadline.

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,780
Deadline.

42
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:30,479
Deadline.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,560
So, Erika, what's a deadline?

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,780
It is the last possible date to do something.

45
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,599
So for example, when we were in school, our teacher would send us homework and say it was for Friday.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,259
So the deadline was Friday.

47
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,539
Was Friday, right?

48
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,800
Or when you're at work, you have projects that you have to finish by a certain date.

49
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,960
That's your deadline.

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,520
Okay, let's look at our next word.

51
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,659
Extension.

52
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,139
Extension.

53
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,020
Extension.

54
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,120
So, extension and deadline go together, right?

55
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,020
Exactly.

56
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,139
If you can't reach your deadline or you can't make your deadline, you must ask for an extension.

57
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:08,719
An extension.

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,759
So you ask for more time.

59
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:14,879
Yeah, an extension is moving the deadline in the future.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,840
Alright, interesting.

61
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,500
Let's look at our next word.

62
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:19,060
Ran into.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,139
Ran into.

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,719
Ran into.

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,639
Ran into some problems.

66
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,340
So we ran into some problems in this dialogue.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,300
Let's listen to some more examples of run into so we can understand the meaning.

68
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:33,819
Example one.

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,120
We ran into a storm on our way home.

70
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,379
Example two.

71
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,199
If you're not careful now, you're going to run into a lot of problems later.

72
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,340
Example three.

73
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,340
I ran into some trouble with my computer.

74
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,180
Okay, good example.

75
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,199
So it's clear now, right?

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,699
Right.

77
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:05,500
If you run into problems, you meet some problems.

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,860
Many students say it in that way.

79
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,520
I met some problems.

80
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,599
Yeah, but that's wrong.

81
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,020
Right.

82
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,719
So you would say I ran into some problems.

83
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,660
I met some problems is wrong, wrong, wrong.

84
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Okay, don't say met some problems.

85
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,980
I ran into some problems.

86
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:21,740
I ran into.

87
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,240
Okay.

88
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,620
And our last word for language takeaway.

89
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,480
Delayed.

90
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,639
Delayed.

91
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,779
Delayed.

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,699
Delayed.

93
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,100
So when something is delayed, it's...

94
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:31,680
Late.

95
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,060
And the opposite is...

96
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,759
On time.

97
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,100
Yeah.

98
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,680
So your flight was delayed.

99
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,839
Or your flight was on time.

100
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,139
The project was delayed.

101
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:42,279
Or your project was on time.

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,779
Clear.

103
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,420
All right.

104
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,699
So now let's go back to the dialogue.

105
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,019
Let's listen to it again.

106
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,319
And this time it will be a little bit slower so you can understand some of these phrases we just talked about.

107
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:06,899
So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

108
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,100
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

109
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,620
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

110
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,100
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

111
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,379
Why are things delayed?

112
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,459
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

113
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,620
I'm not looking for excuses here.

114
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:30,279
I just want to get this finished on time.

115
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,600
I know.

116
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,819
And I apologize for the delay.

117
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,279
But some things were just beyond my control.

118
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:39,720
I had trouble booking the photographer.

119
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,420
And then Michael was sick for three weeks so I couldn't include him in the photos.

120
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,339
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

121
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,160
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,220
I want those photos ASAP.

123
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,500
Okay, so there were some really useful phrases that we saw in this dialogue.

124
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,560
Yeah, some wonderful phrases that you can use when you want to ask for more time.

125
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,500
Okay, so let's look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,540
Alright, what's our first phrase?

127
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,379
I've been meaning to talk to you.

128
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,439
I've been meaning to.

129
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,240
I've been meaning to.

130
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:33,920
Okay, we have some really great examples of how you can combine I've been meaning to with different verbs.

131
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,899
Yeah, let's listen.

132
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,740
Example one.

133
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,860
I'm sorry I haven't called you yet.

134
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,899
I've been meaning to, but I've been busy.

135
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:47,060
Example two.

136
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,860
I've been meaning to tell you, but John quit yesterday.

137
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,879
Example three.

138
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,899
I've been meaning to see that film for a while.

139
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,459
I've been meaning to go to that restaurant, but I haven't had time.

140
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:12,519
So you've been wanting to for a long time.

141
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,980
I've been thinking about it.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,220
I've been planning to do it, but you just haven't done it.

143
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,180
I haven't done it because I haven't had time or money.

144
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,540
Okay, good phrase.

145
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,180
Our next phrase is beyond my control.

146
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,100
Beyond my control.

147
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,839
It's beyond my control.

148
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,560
So it means that I can't control it.

149
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,199
You can't do anything about it.

150
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,199
Can't do anything about it.

151
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,000
The weather is beyond my control.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,540
Right.

153
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,139
Or relate with this project because Jane was sick for one month.

154
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,459
It was beyond my control.

155
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,939
It wasn't your fault.

156
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,240
No.

157
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:46,899
Okay.

158
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,920
And our last phrase for Fluency Builder, put this off.

159
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,899
Put this off.

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,899
Put this off.

161
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,860
Put this off.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,620
So let's listen to some more examples of put this off before we explain the meaning.

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,480
Example one.

164
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,100
I've been putting off this project for a week and it's due tomorrow.

165
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,420
Example two.

166
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:21,439
Can we put off our meeting until next week?

167
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,319
I'm too busy right now.

168
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,360
Example three.

169
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,220
I've been putting off my email all day.

170
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,399
And now I have 50 messages to respond to.

171
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,899
So Marco, when you put something off, you...

172
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:40,779
Leave it for later.

173
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:41,639
Okay.

174
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Right?

175
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,519
So maybe I have to write a report today, but I'm going to put it off till tomorrow.

176
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,720
So you're going to do it tomorrow.

177
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,679
I'll do it tomorrow.

178
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,340
Okay, so we've seen some really great words and some really good phrases.

179
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:58,340
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk some more.

180
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:10,460
So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?

181
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,440
Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that.

182
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,080
I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.

183
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:21,500
You've had over a month to get this finalized.

184
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,740
Why are things delayed?

185
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,940
Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems.

186
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,059
I'm not looking for excuses here.

187
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,700
I just want to get this finished on time.

188
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:39,379
I know, and I apologize for the delay, but some things were just beyond my control.

189
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:46,419
I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn't include him in the photos.

190
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,899
And the design team lost all the files, so I had to redo the pictures.

191
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,860
I'm not going to put this off any longer, Casey.

192
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,399
I want those photos ASAP.

193
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,179
Well, Marco, do you think that Casey's reasons for being late are good?

194
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:18,100
I think so, because it wasn't really her fault, the whole situation with the photographer, and then one of her co-workers was sick for three weeks.

195
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,059
It's not really her fault, right?

196
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,539
But maybe the boss thinks that she's making excuses.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,460
Maybe she's making excuses.

198
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,679
That's really common.

199
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,299
Like, for example, when we were kids, you would say, oh, my dog ate my homework.

200
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,980
Right, but that really happened to me once.

201
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:35,580
Your dog ate your homework?

202
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,860
My cat ate my homework.

203
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
Your cat ate your homework?

204
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah.

205
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,659
And what did your teacher say?

206
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:43,259
Well, actually, I was a really good student, so my teacher believed me.

207
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,539
Well, my teacher wouldn't have believed me.

208
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:46,879
Really?

209
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,279
No, no, she would have called my parents, most likely.

210
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,259
My cat really did eat my homework, and I just left it on the table, and it chewed it all up.

211
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:55,759
That's weird.

212
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,720
Why would your cat do that?

213
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,299
I don't know.

214
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,580
A lot of weird excuses out there.

215
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,639
I was abducted by aliens.

216
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,320
Uh-huh.

217
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,200
My mom accidentally mailed my homework to Africa.

218
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,580
This happened to you?

219
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,919
Creative writing.

220
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:09,740
Okay.

221
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,580
Creative excuses.

222
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:13,480
Well, I want to hear from our listeners.

223
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,759
I want to know what excuses they've used for being late with something.

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,259
So send us your excuses.

225
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,039

234

Bye-bye.
