EnglishPod.com Morning.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hi there Mr.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Anderson, how are you on this fine morning?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fine, thank you.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I barely even got out of bed.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, it's pretty cold alright.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Did you catch the news this morning?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No, I didn't hear about that.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, I don't like football.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
She's really beautiful.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
She's my wife.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh, here's my floor.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nice talking to you.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Goodbye.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh sir, this is the 56th floor.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We're on the 70th.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's okay, I'll take the stairs.
