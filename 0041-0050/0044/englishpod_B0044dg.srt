EnglishPod.com Morning.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,519
Hi there Mr.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,720
Anderson, how are you on this fine morning?

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,380
Fine, thank you.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,660
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,399
I barely even got out of bed.

7
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:21,679
Yeah, it's pretty cold alright.

8
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,679
Did you catch the news this morning?

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,320
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,780
No, I didn't hear about that.

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,120
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,219
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,460
No, I don't like football.

14
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:39,840
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

15
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:41,179
She's really beautiful.

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,240
She's my wife.

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,880
Oh, here's my floor.

18
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,079
Nice talking to you.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,719
Goodbye.

20
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,979
Oh sir, this is the 56th floor.

21
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:48,979
We're on the 70th.

22
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,479
That's okay, I'll take the stairs.
