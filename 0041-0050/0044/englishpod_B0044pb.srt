00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And we're bringing you another great elementary lesson for all our elementary learners.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You know what, Marco?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I think this lesson is so useful.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is language that you can actually use every single day.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Exactly.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Every day.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Because today we're going to be teaching you small talk.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So what is small talk?

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, small talk is small conversations that you would have with people that you don't know very well, but you still want to be polite.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Right?

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And you want to maybe just chat a little bit.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And as always, it's going to be a little bit fast, but don't worry about it.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Because we'll come back in a minute and help you with some of the difficult language.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Morning.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hi there, Mr.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Anderson.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How are you on this fine morning?

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Fine.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I barely even got out of bed.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Did you catch the news this morning?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I didn't hear about that.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, I don't like football.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
She's really beautiful.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
She's my wife.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, here's my floor.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Nice talking to you.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good bye.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, sir, this is the 56th floor.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We're on the 70th.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's okay.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll take the stairs.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, I think this guy was a little bit annoying.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, Mr.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Anderson really didn't want to talk to him, did he?

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, I think that was pretty obvious.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He left the elevator in a hurry.

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, let's take a look at our language today in Language Takeaway.

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Language Takeaway.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, what do we have today in Language Takeaway?

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Well, we've got four words and phrases, and our first one is barely even.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Barely even.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Barely even.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So how do we use barely even?

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a little bit difficult.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's really similar to like almost couldn't or almost nothing or almost can't.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So we use it usually in a negative sense.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
For example, I could say, I was so busy today, I could barely even eat my lunch.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, so I can maybe say, it was so dark, I could barely even see.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, or I'm so poor, I can barely even pay my rent.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, good.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Barely even.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right, let's take a look at our next one.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Catch.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Catch.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Catch.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Did you catch the news?

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So by did you catch the news, you mean did you hear the news?

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Exactly.

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So how else can we use this?

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did you catch?

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A really common one is, I didn't catch your name.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, I didn't hear your name.

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I didn't hear your name.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, and we can also say, I didn't catch what he said.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't catch what he said, yeah.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I didn't hear.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
By the way.

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
By the way.

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
By the way.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
By the way.

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, so let's listen to some examples first of how we can use by the way, and then we'll come back and talk more about it.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Example one.

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are you going to be at the meeting today?

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, I'll be there.

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, by the way, did you hear what happened today?

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Example two.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
By the way, I almost forgot to tell you, Maggie called.

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so I see that when we say by the way, we're introducing a point after we've already talked about something.

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Exactly, and maybe it's not even related to the topic we were talking about.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, it's a different topic.

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Different topic, right?

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's like saying, oh, I almost forgot to tell you.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Exactly.

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So it's like, oh, Erica, don't forget we have a meeting today.

102
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, and by the way, I like your new haircut.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thanks, Marco.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right, see?

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's the way you would use by the way.

107
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, and our last word on language takeaway.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Take the stairs.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Take the stairs.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Take the stairs.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Take the stairs.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So it doesn't mean you're going to take them somewhere.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No, no, you're not taking them home with you.

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It means you're going to go up the stairs.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay, so take the stairs.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A lot of people might say use the stairs or go up the stairs, but our EnglishPod learners, they know, right?

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
To use take the stairs.

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yep.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Take the stairs.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, so now we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And this will help you to catch these phrases a little bit better.

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Morning.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hi there, Mr.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anderson.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How are you on this fine morning?

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Fine.

129
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you.

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I barely even got out of bed.

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, it's pretty cold.

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
All right.

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Did you catch the news this morning?

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, I didn't hear about that.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, I don't like football.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the Opus Christmas party.

141
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
She's really beautiful.

142
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
She's my wife.

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, here's my floor.

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nice talking to you.

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Goodbye.

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, sir, this is the 56th floor.

147
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We're on the 70th.

148
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's OK.

149
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll take the stairs.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OK, so now let's take a look at ways to start up some small talk in putting it together.

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Putting it together.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, Marco, today we've got some great patterns or structures that you can use in in your small talk.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, exactly.

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We saw some great patterns.

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's start with the first one.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It sure is cold this morning.

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It sure is cold.

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It sure is cold.

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It sure is cold.

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
OK, so we can change it up a little bit and say it sure is hot or it sure is late.

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
OK, this sure is interesting.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Or you could say he sure is smart.

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So basically you can change the adjective.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, cold, hot, smart, hard, difficult.

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And when you say sure is, this is a great way of emphasizing that you believe this adjective to be true.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
OK, sure is.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, what would be the answer to this?

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, in the dialogue, Mr.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Anderson said, yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's pretty cold, all right.

171
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's pretty cold, all right.

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So, again, using the examples we used before, we can say, oh, it's pretty hot, all right.

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Or it's pretty late, all right.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Or he's pretty smart, all right.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or this is pretty interesting, all right.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So it means you're agreeing with that person.

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
OK, great.

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, Marco, these things, it sure is blank.

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And yeah, it's blank, all right.

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
These can go together really well, can't they?

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, as a question and answer format, they go well.

182
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how these two phrases work together?

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Example one.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It sure is a nice day today.

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, it's nice, all right.

186
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Example two.

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The bus is sure late today.

188
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, it's late, all right.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Example three.

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This class is really hard.

191
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah, it's hard, all right.

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
OK, so now let's take a look at our next word and putting it together.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did you happen to?

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Did you happen to?

195
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Did you happen to?

196
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Did you happen to?

197
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Did you happen to see Bob this morning?

198
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I didn't happen to see Bob.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it means like, did you by chance?

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
By chance.

201
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Did you by chance see Bob or something?

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
OK, another example would be, did you happen to go to that restaurant I recommended?

203
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or maybe do you happen to have a pen?

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you happen to know where the bathroom is?

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, that's a really useful one.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's a useful one.

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's basically how you would use this structure.

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Did you happen to?

209
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Do you happen to?

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So now let's listen to our dialogue for the third time.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I'm sure that you'll be able to understand everything.

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Morning.

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hi there, Mr.

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Anderson.

215
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How are you on this fine morning?

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Fine, thank you.

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It sure is cold this morning, isn't it?

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I barely even got out of bed.

219
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, it's pretty cold, all right.

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Did you catch the news this morning?

221
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I heard that there was a fire in Byron Street.

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, I didn't hear about that.

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you happen to watch the football game last night?

224
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The Patriots scored in the last minute.

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, I don't like football.

226
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh, by the way, I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party.

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She's really beautiful.

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
She's my wife.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, here's my floor.

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Nice talking to you.

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Goodbye.

232
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, sir, this is the 56th floor.

233
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Where on the 70th?

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's OK, I'll take the stairs.

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right, Marco, that was a really useful dialogue for daily life, wasn't it?

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, I think you can find a lot of useful language there and that you can apply tomorrow.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, speaking of useful things, let's talk a little bit about our website.

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
