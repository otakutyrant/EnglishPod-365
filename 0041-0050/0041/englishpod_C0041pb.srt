00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:03,819
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,639
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:05,740
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:07,820
And today we're going back to the movies.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,660
That's right.

7
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:12,759
We've got a great lesson today, and I'm really excited about this dialogue.

8
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,900
I think it's fantastic.

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,600
We have an original EnglishPod production of a movie trailer.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,480
So what is a movie trailer?

11
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:27,219
Well, whenever you go to the cinema, before the movie starts, you have previews of upcoming movies.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,539
So like almost an advertisement for a future movie.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:30,980
Exactly.

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,679
Okay.

15
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,799
So that's a movie trailer.

16
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,500
And that's what we're bringing you today.

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,259
A lot of great language you'll commonly hear in action movies.

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:39,100
Right.

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,619
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,579
Vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,619
We have one word today.

22
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:46,759
Possess.

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:47,899
Possess.

24
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:48,619
Possess.

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,520
Possess.

26
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,859
So when you possess something, you have it.

27
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,520
It's in your possession.

28
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,219
Simple.

29
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,159
You have it, right?

30
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:56,439
Yep.

31
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,340
So in this dialogue, our actors possess something very important.

32
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:03,500
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

33
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,439
And it's going to be a little bit fast and a little bit difficult to understand.

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:24,980
But don't worry, look.

35
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,659
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

36
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:44,060
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

37
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,260
I don't care where they are.

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't care what it takes.

39
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,299
You find them and bring them to me.

40
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,659
They only have to get them out of there.

41
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:22,520
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,740
Double the action.

43
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:25,840
Get down.

44
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,159
Triple the excitement.

45
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:29,860
Get down again.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,620
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

47
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,020
I'm going to make them run off again with you.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,240
Two hosts, one podcast.

49
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,259
English Pod.

50
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,500
Coming to a theater near you.

51
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,580
Wow.

52
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,439
So it sounds like a really good movie.

53
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,000
I know.

54
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,879
When's it coming out?

55
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,800
I think in 2015.

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
OK, I'll put that in my calendar.

57
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:12,800
OK, let's take a look at the vocabulary we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

58
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,580
Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,419
In Language Takeaway today, we have three words.

60
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,400
What's our first one?

61
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,219
Survival.

62
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Survival.

63
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:23,479
Survival.

64
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:24,840
Survival.

65
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:31,180
Well, survival is continuing to live even in really hard times.

66
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,520
It comes from the verb to survive.

67
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,400
So survival is the noun form.

68
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:37,099
Right.

69
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,900
So maybe you are lost in the jungle and you have to fight for survival.

70
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,379
Right.

71
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:45,139
You have to try to survive.

72
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,159
OK, our next word.

73
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,199
Defend.

74
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,360
Defend.

75
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,500
Defend.

76
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,259
Defend.

77
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,960
So let's listen to some examples of defend so you can understand the meaning.

78
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:58,939
Example one.

79
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:02,840
We have to defend the castle.

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,620
The army is trying to kill the king.

81
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,319
Example two.

82
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,159
The soldiers defended the base in a difficult battle.

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,480
Example three.

84
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,699
These new machine guns will defend us.

85
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,879
So basically it's to protect, right?

86
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,480
Right.

87
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,579
To protect from something that is really harmful.

88
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,199
OK, so you would defend your children.

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,279
You would defend your your house, your house, your castle, your dog, your cat.

90
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,720
Yeah.

91
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,480
OK.

92
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,259
And our last word on Language Takeaway.

93
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,079
Rough.

94
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,040
Rough.

95
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Rough.

96
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,420
Rough.

97
00:04:51,579 --> 00:04:51,959
Right.

98
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,620
It's got that sound.

99
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,819
Uh huh.

100
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:01,680
So it basically means so when something it's rough, it's a little bit violent and hard, hard.

101
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:01,980
Yeah.

102
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,660
For example, boxing is a rough sport.

103
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,779
Or hockey is also a rough sport.

104
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:07,360
Exactly.

105
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,839
So you have rough sports or maybe even a person can be a little bit rough.

106
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:12,339
Yes.

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,199
Or that person can play rough.

108
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,060
Play rough.

109
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,699
Exactly.

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
So rough.

111
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,220
OK, so we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

112
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,980
And this time it'll be a little bit slower so you can understand the language a little bit more clearly.

113
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,160
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

114
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:47,339
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,660
I don't care where they are.

116
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,459
I don't care what it takes.

117
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,980
You find them and bring them to me.

118
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,180
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

119
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,459
OK, you want to play rough?

120
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:07,100
Say hello to my little friend.

121
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,120
With a little help from the governor.

122
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,540
Listen to me.

123
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,720
We have to get them out of there no matter what.

124
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,360
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

125
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,800
Double the action.

126
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:21,939
Get down.

127
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,259
Triple the excitement.

128
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,720
Get down again.

129
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,160
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

130
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,899
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.

131
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,819
Two hosts, one podcast.

132
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,300
EnglishPod, coming to a theater near you.

133
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,000
So we saw some interesting phrases in this dialogue.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,319
Let's take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,160
Fluency Builder.

136
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,399
The first phrase that we saw at all costs.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,019
At all costs.

138
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,699
At all costs.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,220
At all costs.

140
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,720
So let's listen to some examples before we explain at all costs.

141
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:05,680
Example one.

142
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll protect my kids at all costs.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,300
Example two.

144
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,139
We have to get this project done at all costs.

145
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,879
Example three.

146
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:39,660
You find those kids at all costs.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,379
You're going to protect them even if it's really hard.

148
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,180
Right, it doesn't matter how hard it is or what you have to do.

149
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:48,839
Exactly.

150
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,699
You'll do it.

151
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,319
At all costs.

152
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:59,000
Now let's take a look at our second phrase for Fluency Builder, and it's very similar to at all costs.

153
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,899
Yeah, really similar.

154
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,420
No matter what.

155
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:02,819
No matter what.

156
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,420
No matter what.

157
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:05,199
No matter what.

158
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,540
For example, I'm going to go on vacation no matter what, my boss says.

159
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
Nothing's going to stop you.

160
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,800
Right, if he says no, I'm still going on vacation.

161
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,319
And I'm going to protect my kids no matter what.

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,040
Exactly.

163
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,040
No matter what.

164
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,019
I don't have kids though.

165
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,060
But you will protect them no matter what.

166
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,079
If I had them.

167
00:08:25,499 --> 00:08:27,579
Okay, and our last phrase.

168
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:29,939
Stand in their way.

169
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:32,299
Stand in their way.

170
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,299
Stand in their way.

171
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,620
Stand in their way.

172
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:43,539
So let's listen to some examples of stand in someone's way, and then we'll come back and explain it.

173
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,519
Example one.

174
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,379
Don't let anything stand in the way of your goals.

175
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,860
Example two.

176
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,519
I'm going to find that guy and nothing is going to stand in my way.

177
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,919
Example three.

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,519
I don't care what happens.

179
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,639
I'm going to get that money and you better not stand in my way.

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:28,000
So when something stands in your way, it's it's preventing you from reaching your goal from reaching your goal, right?

181
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,259
But we can also have somebody standing in your way physically.

182
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,840
Like really, you're standing close to me and I can't pass through the door, right?

183
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:39,220
So maybe the person is at the door and it's standing in my way.

184
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,080
I can't go in.

185
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,899
Yeah, okay.

186
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,519
But here we're not really talking about a real thing, right?

187
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:45,899
That you can touch, right?

188
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,600
It's more of some obstacle that's preventing you from reaching your goals or from doing what you want to do.

189
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:50,980
Yep.

190
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,779
So now we can listen to our dialogue again, and now you can understand these words that we've just talked about.

191
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Look.

192
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:15,720
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

193
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:29,259
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

194
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,539
I don't care where they are.

195
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,220
I don't care what it takes.

196
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:36,500
You find them and bring them to me.

197
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,539
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

198
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,480
Do you want to play rough?

199
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,440
Say hello to my little friend.

200
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
With a little help from the governor.

201
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:01,120
Listen to me.

202
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
We have to get them out of there.

203
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,960
No matter what.

204
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,720
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

205
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,960
Double the action.

206
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:11,019
Get down.

207
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,399
Triple the excitement.

208
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,059
Get down again.

209
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,580
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

210
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm going to make them an offer again.

211
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,500
Two hosts, one podcast.

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
English Pod.

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,580
Coming to a theater near you.

214
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,379
I know that you're a big movie fan, right?

215
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,940
Yeah, I'm a big movie fan.

216
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:53,080
I usually watch maybe three or five movies a week.

217
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:53,639
Really?

218
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,059
Yeah.

219
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,740
Wow.

220
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,659
Many students of English like to watch movies as a way to improve their English.

221
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,539
That's one of the best ways to learn English is through songs and movies.

222
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,879
What do you think are some useful movies that people can watch to practice English?

223
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I would recommend children's movies.

224
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:11,340
Really?

225
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,620
Yeah, they have simple vocabulary, but they have very common language.

226
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,240
And also what's happening in the movie is very easy to understand and to follow.

227
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,220
So you can see the action and then hear the word.

228
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:23,840
Exactly.

229
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:32,960
So if you like to watch movies, rent a DVD or go buy a DVD, watch it in the original language with English subtitles.

230
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,159
So you should watch it in English with English subtitles.

231
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:37,480
Yeah.

232
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,419
And what subtitles?

233
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:44,559
Subtitles are the words that you see at the bottom of the screen that translate, okay, what the people are saying.

234
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:44,899
Okay.

235
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,559
Yeah, that's the best thing to do.

236
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,539
Try that exercise.

237
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,259
If you have a pen and paper with you, it's much better.

238
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,200
You can pause the movie, write down a word you don't understand and then maybe review it later.

239
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,679
That's a really good tip.

240
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:05,919
I always tell my students that they should watch movies, listen to music, read the newspaper and write down at least five new words or phrases a week.

241
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,980
Yeah, yeah, it's a really good exercise and you'll improve a lot.

242
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,379
Yes.

243
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,279
So everyone, we want you to go out and watch a movie in English.

244
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,860
Turn on the subtitles and write down some new vocabulary.

245
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:17,720
Exactly.

246
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:26,019
And if you have any comments or questions or maybe even suggestions, you can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave them in our community page.

247

248
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:33,980
Exactly.

249
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,279
So we're out of time today.

250
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,779
We'll see you guys next time.

251
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,100
Until then, it's goodbye.
