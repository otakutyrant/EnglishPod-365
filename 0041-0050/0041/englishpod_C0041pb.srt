00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And today we're going back to the movies.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've got a great lesson today, and I'm really excited about this dialogue.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I think it's fantastic.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We have an original EnglishPod production of a movie trailer.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So what is a movie trailer?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, whenever you go to the cinema, before the movie starts, you have previews of upcoming movies.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So like almost an advertisement for a future movie.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Exactly.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So that's a movie trailer.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And that's what we're bringing you today.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A lot of great language you'll commonly hear in action movies.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Right.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We have one word today.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Possess.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Possess.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Possess.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Possess.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So when you possess something, you have it.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's in your possession.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Simple.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have it, right?

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yep.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So in this dialogue, our actors possess something very important.

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And it's going to be a little bit fast and a little bit difficult to understand.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But don't worry, look.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't care where they are.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't care what it takes.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You find them and bring them to me.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They only have to get them out of there.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Double the action.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Get down.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Triple the excitement.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Get down again.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to make them run off again with you.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Two hosts, one podcast.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
English Pod.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Coming to a theater near you.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wow.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So it sounds like a really good movie.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I know.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
When's it coming out?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think in 2015.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
OK, I'll put that in my calendar.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
OK, let's take a look at the vocabulary we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In Language Takeaway today, we have three words.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What's our first one?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Survival.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Survival.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Survival.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Survival.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, survival is continuing to live even in really hard times.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It comes from the verb to survive.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So survival is the noun form.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Right.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So maybe you are lost in the jungle and you have to fight for survival.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You have to try to survive.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OK, our next word.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Defend.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Defend.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Defend.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Defend.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So let's listen to some examples of defend so you can understand the meaning.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Example one.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We have to defend the castle.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The army is trying to kill the king.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Example two.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The soldiers defended the base in a difficult battle.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Example three.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
These new machine guns will defend us.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So basically it's to protect, right?

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
To protect from something that is really harmful.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OK, so you would defend your children.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You would defend your your house, your house, your castle, your dog, your cat.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
OK.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And our last word on Language Takeaway.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Rough.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Rough.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Rough.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Rough.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's got that sound.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Uh huh.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So it basically means so when something it's rough, it's a little bit violent and hard, hard.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
For example, boxing is a rough sport.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or hockey is also a rough sport.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Exactly.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So you have rough sports or maybe even a person can be a little bit rough.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Or that person can play rough.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Play rough.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Exactly.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So rough.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OK, so we're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And this time it'll be a little bit slower so you can understand the language a little bit more clearly.

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't care where they are.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't care what it takes.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You find them and bring them to me.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
OK, you want to play rough?

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Say hello to my little friend.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
With a little help from the governor.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Listen to me.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We have to get them out of there no matter what.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Double the action.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Get down.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Triple the excitement.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Get down again.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Two hosts, one podcast.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
EnglishPod, coming to a theater near you.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So we saw some interesting phrases in this dialogue.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Fluency Builder.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The first phrase that we saw at all costs.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
At all costs.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
At all costs.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
At all costs.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So let's listen to some examples before we explain at all costs.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Example one.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll protect my kids at all costs.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Example two.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We have to get this project done at all costs.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Example three.

146
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You find those kids at all costs.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're going to protect them even if it's really hard.

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right, it doesn't matter how hard it is or what you have to do.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Exactly.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You'll do it.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
At all costs.

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now let's take a look at our second phrase for Fluency Builder, and it's very similar to at all costs.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, really similar.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No matter what.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No matter what.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No matter what.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No matter what.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, I'm going to go on vacation no matter what, my boss says.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nothing's going to stop you.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Right, if he says no, I'm still going on vacation.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And I'm going to protect my kids no matter what.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Exactly.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No matter what.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't have kids though.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But you will protect them no matter what.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If I had them.

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, and our last phrase.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Stand in their way.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Stand in their way.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Stand in their way.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Stand in their way.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So let's listen to some examples of stand in someone's way, and then we'll come back and explain it.

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Example one.

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't let anything stand in the way of your goals.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Example two.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going to find that guy and nothing is going to stand in my way.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Example three.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't care what happens.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to get that money and you better not stand in my way.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So when something stands in your way, it's it's preventing you from reaching your goal from reaching your goal, right?

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But we can also have somebody standing in your way physically.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Like really, you're standing close to me and I can't pass through the door, right?

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So maybe the person is at the door and it's standing in my way.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I can't go in.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, okay.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But here we're not really talking about a real thing, right?

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That you can touch, right?

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's more of some obstacle that's preventing you from reaching your goals or from doing what you want to do.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yep.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So now we can listen to our dialogue again, and now you can understand these words that we've just talked about.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Look.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
In a digital world, even the strongest must fight for survival.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Two people possess a secret so valuable, so powerful, they have to defend it at all costs.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't care where they are.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't care what it takes.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You find them and bring them to me.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
They only had one chance and their chance was to fight back.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you want to play rough?

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Say hello to my little friend.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
With a little help from the governor.

201
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Listen to me.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We have to get them out of there.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No matter what.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Nothing will prevent them from doing their job.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Double the action.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Get down.

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Triple the excitement.

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Get down again.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This summer, nothing will stand in their way.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to make them an offer again.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Two hosts, one podcast.

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
English Pod.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Coming to a theater near you.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I know that you're a big movie fan, right?

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, I'm a big movie fan.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I usually watch maybe three or five movies a week.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Really?

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wow.

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Many students of English like to watch movies as a way to improve their English.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's one of the best ways to learn English is through songs and movies.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What do you think are some useful movies that people can watch to practice English?

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, I would recommend children's movies.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Really?

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, they have simple vocabulary, but they have very common language.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And also what's happening in the movie is very easy to understand and to follow.

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So you can see the action and then hear the word.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Exactly.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So if you like to watch movies, rent a DVD or go buy a DVD, watch it in the original language with English subtitles.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So you should watch it in English with English subtitles.

231
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

232
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And what subtitles?

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Subtitles are the words that you see at the bottom of the screen that translate, okay, what the people are saying.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay.

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, that's the best thing to do.

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Try that exercise.

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If you have a pen and paper with you, it's much better.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You can pause the movie, write down a word you don't understand and then maybe review it later.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's a really good tip.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I always tell my students that they should watch movies, listen to music, read the newspaper and write down at least five new words or phrases a week.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, yeah, it's a really good exercise and you'll improve a lot.

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So everyone, we want you to go out and watch a movie in English.

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Turn on the subtitles and write down some new vocabulary.

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Exactly.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And if you have any comments or questions or maybe even suggestions, you can come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave them in our community page.

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Marco and I are always around to help you and we love to hear about what you're learning and what movies you're watching.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Exactly.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So we're out of time today.

250
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We'll see you guys next time.

251
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Until then, it's goodbye.
