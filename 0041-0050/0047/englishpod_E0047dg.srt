1
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:12,960
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan.

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:21,199
As I'm sure you're all aware, with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost-efficient ways of producing our goods.

3
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:29,199
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies, so we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,640
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,259
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,240
Why would we want to do that?

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,679
Right.

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:01:02,700
Production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing queue length like, for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:14,519
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.

12
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,900
I see.

13
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,560
That makes sense.

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,019
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero-defects quality program.

15
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,540
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items, and therefore they must be eliminated.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:39,219
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

17
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,859
I'm with you on this one.

18
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,519
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,799
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

20
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,060
Exactly.

21
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,280
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.
