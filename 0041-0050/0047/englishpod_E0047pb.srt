00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And we're bringing you a very advanced lesson today.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're talking about another business topic, aren't we?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's a topic that's kind of popular these days, all about efficiency and reducing costs.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we're going to be talking about the just-in-time philosophy.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know much about this philosophy, so good thing we've got Marco here.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, what we are going to be looking at is not really in-depth.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're just going to be looking at some basic points of what a just-in-time philosophy would be like in a company.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But what we're really going to be looking at is the language to do with this philosophy, right?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Exactly.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to be looking at some technical terms and some other useful phrases that you can use when you are talking in a business setting.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, well why don't we get started with the language then?

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
On time.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Lead time.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Lead time.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
L-E-A-D, lead.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Lead time.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Right, like lead.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is something that factories usually would use.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yep, yeah.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I guess lead time is the time in between point A and point B on a production schedule, right?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Right, so you could have, for example, production lead time.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So that's the time between when you make an order and when the product is finished.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Exactly, and you could also have delivery lead time.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So the time between when you place an order and when the product gets delivered to you.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So depending on the companies, you have different lead times.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Some are three days, other are five days, other are forty-five days.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And we at EnglishPod have two-week lead time for our podcast, right?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But our delivery lead time is every other day.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's true.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Nice.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, that's all we're going to be previewing today, so why don't we just listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain some of these tricky vocabulary words that we'll see.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why would we want to do that?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing queue length like, for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I see.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That makes sense.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero-defects quality program.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items, and therefore, they must be eliminated.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm with you on this one.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action first.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so they're going to implement just-in-time in their company.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, I guess they're putting in some cost control measures.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So Marco, there's some great language in here.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why don't we look at it now in Language Takeaway.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, the first word today, redundancies.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Redundancies.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Redundancies.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Redundancies.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So this is kind of a strange word because usually a redundancy is when you're speaking, right?

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, maybe when you say something that's already been said.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Exactly.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You say something that has already been said, but we also use it in the business world.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right, and it comes from the base word redundant, right?

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Meaning extra, more than what's needed.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So when a person or a position is made redundant, basically it means they get laid off, right?

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Right, so redundancies are a synonym of layoffs.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Exactly.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Alright, let's take a look at our next word.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Workstations.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Workstations.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Workstations.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Workstations.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So a workstation could be anything from your desk.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah, or maybe a workbench.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
A workbench.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Or even a place on a production line.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Right, so you're a certain machine or something like that.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, so basically a workstation is the area where you work.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, so you can say, can we get a new workstation for the new team member?

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Or I could say, I want to move my workstation closer to my employees.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Alright, so workstation.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
At a given machine.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
At a given machine.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
At a given.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At a given.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is an interesting way to say at any machine.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Exactly.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, given here is operating exactly the same as, here the word given is operating exactly the same way as any.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As any.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yep.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, so let's listen to some examples of how we can change it up a little bit and we can use this given word.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Example 1.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In this factory, how many cars are in production at any given time?

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Example 2.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
On any given day, about 40 million people use the internet.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Example 3.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Firefighters have to be ready to attend an emergency at any given moment.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Alright, so any given time, at any given moment.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yep.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Any given day.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, now let's take a look at our last word today.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Defective.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Defective.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Defective.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Defective.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So if something is defective.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It has a problem with it.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It has a problem.

121
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We can say defective is an adjective.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right, and the noun is defect.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Defect.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yep.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So if something has a defect, it is defective.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right, so for example, maybe you produce chairs and you make one and this chair is missing a wheel.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, so it's defective.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes, the defect is the missing wheel.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The defect is the missing wheel.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, so before we listen to our dialogue again, I want to take a look at this phrase, I'm with you on this one.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm with you on this one.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm with you on this one.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm with you on this one.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So what does that mean exactly?

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm with you on this one.

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I agree with you.

138
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I agree with you on this point.

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Exactly.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, so if you agree with somebody on a certain point, you would say, oh, I'm with you on this one.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I agree with you.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Exactly.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the history of this just in time.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
As I'm sure you're all aware with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just in time philosophy.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why would we want to do that?

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

152
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Right.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I see.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That makes sense.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore they must be eliminated.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm with you on this one.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

164
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Exactly.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
First.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,000
All right, so Marco, I mentioned at the beginning of the lesson that I don't know much about just in time, but luckily you do, right?

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, I know a little bit about it.

169
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So tell me a little bit about where this philosophy came from.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What are the origins of this idea?

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It actually became really popular with Toyota and it was called the Toyota production system.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So many people think it's Japanese but in reality the Japanese got it from the United States.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's a philosophy that was thought up by Ford Motor Company in order to improve their production line.

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But when the Japanese visited Ford Motor Company it wasn't fully implemented yet and oddly enough they found this philosophy working already in a Piggly Wiggly.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What's a Piggly Wiggly?

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Piggly Wiggly was a chain of grocery stores in the United States.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not sure if they're still around but yeah, they were really big and basically Piggly Wiggly was using this to improve their whole system of shipping and of stocking and everything.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, so how does it work?

180
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So basically what you try to do is make your processes more efficient, reduce the amount of space you're using, etc.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And this was really important for Japanese because of course they don't have that much space in Japan to have warehouses like in other countries.

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So what you're saying is they're producing goods just for the time they need it, right?

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Exactly.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So trying to not be overstocked or have like a long lead time or something.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Long lead times where you have to keep something in a warehouse exactly.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So that's why it's so efficient.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And also it's about improving the efficiency between processes.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So what's sometimes called a bottleneck.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You can have really good processes in the beginning but in the end maybe you have only one workstation that's taking all these orders and everything gets bottled up and it causes delays.

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So in the dialogue they want to implement the just in time strategy as a way of avoiding redundancies but it sounds to me like actually this might cause redundancies sometimes.

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well yeah, sometimes it does.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sometimes when you make workstations more efficient or when you make all your processes work more fluidly, sometimes inevitably you will have to lay off some people that are redundant.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, have you ever worked in a company where they've implemented just in time?

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, actually I've never really worked at a place where this philosophy was working but I did used to work at a place where we had Six Sigma which is kind of which is a little bit similar.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, well I guess we'll need a lesson on Six Sigma in the future.

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, we'll see if we come up with Six Sigma and what it means and it's kind of interesting but we want to hear what you think.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes, have you guys worked in a place where they use just in time?

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Exactly or if you have any quality control measures or how does your company avoid having defective items or defective services?

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
