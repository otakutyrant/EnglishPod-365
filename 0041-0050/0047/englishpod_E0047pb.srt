00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,759
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:04,219
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:04,980
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,059
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,119
And we're bringing you a very advanced lesson today.

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,039
That's right.

7
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,199
We're talking about another business topic, aren't we?

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,920
It's a topic that's kind of popular these days, all about efficiency and reducing costs.

9
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,480
So we're going to be talking about the just-in-time philosophy.

10
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:25,800
I don't know much about this philosophy, so good thing we've got Marco here.

11
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,679
Well, what we are going to be looking at is not really in-depth.

12
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,920
We're just going to be looking at some basic points of what a just-in-time philosophy would be like in a company.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,939
But what we're really going to be looking at is the language to do with this philosophy, right?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,200
Exactly.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:46,399
We're going to be looking at some technical terms and some other useful phrases that you can use when you are talking in a business setting.

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,200
Okay, well why don't we get started with the language then?

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,240
Okay, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,100
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,840
On time.

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,359
Lead time.

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,520
Lead time.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,859
L-E-A-D, lead.

23
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:01,659
Lead time.

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,020
Right, like lead.

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,859
This is something that factories usually would use.

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:06,719
Yep, yeah.

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:14,000
I guess lead time is the time in between point A and point B on a production schedule, right?

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,260
Right, so you could have, for example, production lead time.

29
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,799
So that's the time between when you make an order and when the product is finished.

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,980
Exactly, and you could also have delivery lead time.

31
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,099
So the time between when you place an order and when the product gets delivered to you.

32
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,859
So depending on the companies, you have different lead times.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,579
Some are three days, other are five days, other are forty-five days.

34
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,640
And we at EnglishPod have two-week lead time for our podcast, right?

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,500
But our delivery lead time is every other day.

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,140
That's true.

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:46,719
Nice.

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:56,799
Okay, that's all we're going to be previewing today, so why don't we just listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain some of these tricky vocabulary words that we'll see.

39
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:28,000
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,620
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,580
Why would we want to do that?

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,560
I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,360
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:58,080
Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing queue length like, for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

45
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:09,840
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.

46
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,240
I see.

47
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,900
That makes sense.

48
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:19,360
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero-defects quality program.

49
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,879
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items, and therefore, they must be eliminated.

50
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:34,560
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

51
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,199
I'm with you on this one.

52
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,879
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,159
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

54
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,400
Exactly.

55
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,599
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action first.

56
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,379
Okay, so they're going to implement just-in-time in their company.

57
00:03:59,840 --> 00:03:59,919
Yes.

58
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,900
Yeah, I guess they're putting in some cost control measures.

59
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,300
So Marco, there's some great language in here.

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,439
Why don't we look at it now in Language Takeaway.

61
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,379
Okay, the first word today, redundancies.

62
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:15,699
Redundancies.

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,399
Redundancies.

64
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:18,160
Redundancies.

65
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,220
So this is kind of a strange word because usually a redundancy is when you're speaking, right?

66
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,759
Yeah, maybe when you say something that's already been said.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,420
Exactly.

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,680
You say something that has already been said, but we also use it in the business world.

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,079
Right, and it comes from the base word redundant, right?

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Okay.

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,360
Meaning extra, more than what's needed.

72
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

73
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,000
So when a person or a position is made redundant, basically it means they get laid off, right?

74
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,079
Right, so redundancies are a synonym of layoffs.

75
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:48,920
Exactly.

76
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:49,720
Okay.

77
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,620
Alright, let's take a look at our next word.

78
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:52,920
Workstations.

79
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,040
Workstations.

80
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:55,339
Workstations.

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,079
Workstations.

82
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,879
So a workstation could be anything from your desk.

83
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,480
Yeah, or maybe a workbench.

84
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,540
A workbench.

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,839
Or even a place on a production line.

86
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:07,040
Right, so you're a certain machine or something like that.

87
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,300
Yeah, so basically a workstation is the area where you work.

88
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Okay.

89
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,040
Okay, so you can say, can we get a new workstation for the new team member?

90
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,100
Or I could say, I want to move my workstation closer to my employees.

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,180
Alright, so workstation.

92
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,300
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

93
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,060
At a given machine.

94
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,439
At a given machine.

95
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,819
At a given.

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,959
At a given.

97
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,339
This is an interesting way to say at any machine.

98
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,019
Exactly.

99
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,579
Okay.

100
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:44,139
Yeah, given here is operating exactly the same as, here the word given is operating exactly the same way as any.

101
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,279
As any.

102
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,660
Yep.

103
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:52,759
Okay, so let's listen to some examples of how we can change it up a little bit and we can use this given word.

104
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,420
Example 1.

105
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,579
In this factory, how many cars are in production at any given time?

106
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:02,800
Example 2.

107
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,879
On any given day, about 40 million people use the internet.

108
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
Example 3.

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,579
Firefighters have to be ready to attend an emergency at any given moment.

110
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,300
Alright, so any given time, at any given moment.

111
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:23,720
Yep.

112
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,759
Any given day.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,819
Okay, now let's take a look at our last word today.

114
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,240
Defective.

115
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,459
Defective.

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,980
Defective.

117
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:33,759
Defective.

118
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,420
So if something is defective.

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,759
It has a problem with it.

120
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:38,660
It has a problem.

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,079
Yeah.

122
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
We can say defective is an adjective.

123
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,680
Right, and the noun is defect.

124
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:44,459
Defect.

125
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:44,839
Yep.

126
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,060
So if something has a defect, it is defective.

127
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,699
Right, so for example, maybe you produce chairs and you make one and this chair is missing a wheel.

128
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,459
Okay, so it's defective.

129
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,620
Yes, the defect is the missing wheel.

130
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,980
The defect is the missing wheel.

131
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:05,120
Okay, so before we listen to our dialogue again, I want to take a look at this phrase, I'm with you on this one.

132
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,259
I'm with you on this one.

133
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,899
I'm with you on this one.

134
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,959
I'm with you on this one.

135
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,060
So what does that mean exactly?

136
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,379
I'm with you on this one.

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
I agree with you.

138
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,000
I agree with you on this point.

139
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:16,579
Exactly.

140
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:22,220
Okay, so if you agree with somebody on a certain point, you would say, oh, I'm with you on this one.

141
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,100
I agree with you.

142
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,439
Exactly.

143
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:31,740
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll come back and talk a little bit more about the history of this just in time.

144
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,060
I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan.

145
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:56,300
As I'm sure you're all aware with the credit crunch and the global financial crisis, we're obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,360
We don't want to have to be looking at redundancies.

147
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,259
So we've outlined a brief plan to implement the just in time philosophy.

148
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,720
We have two basic points that we want to focus on.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,339
First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.

150
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,319
Why would we want to do that?

151
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,420
I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.

152
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,079
Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead times for better overall efficiency.

153
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:21,759
Right.

154
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:37,779
Production lead times can be reduced by moving workstations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes.

155
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:49,600
Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.

156
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,000
I see.

157
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,639
That makes sense.

158
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,100
The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program.

159
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,620
We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore they must be eliminated.

160
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:14,299
A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.

161
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm with you on this one.

162
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,620
It's essential that we reduce these errors.

163
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,899
We've got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.

164
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,139
Exactly.

165
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,399
Well, let's look at how we're going to put this plan into action.

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,259
First.

167
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:42,139
All right, so Marco, I mentioned at the beginning of the lesson that I don't know much about just in time, but luckily you do, right?

168
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,519
Yeah, I know a little bit about it.

169
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:48,240
So tell me a little bit about where this philosophy came from.

170
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,940
What are the origins of this idea?

171
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,039
It actually became really popular with Toyota and it was called the Toyota production system.

172
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:01,059
So many people think it's Japanese but in reality the Japanese got it from the United States.

173
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:07,720
It's a philosophy that was thought up by Ford Motor Company in order to improve their production line.

174
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:17,039
But when the Japanese visited Ford Motor Company it wasn't fully implemented yet and oddly enough they found this philosophy working already in a Piggly Wiggly.

175
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,399
What's a Piggly Wiggly?

176
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:23,100
Piggly Wiggly was a chain of grocery stores in the United States.

177
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Okay.

178
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:34,820
I'm not sure if they're still around but yeah, they were really big and basically Piggly Wiggly was using this to improve their whole system of shipping and of stocking and everything.

179
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
Okay, so how does it work?

180
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:44,360
So basically what you try to do is make your processes more efficient, reduce the amount of space you're using, etc.

181
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:52,740
And this was really important for Japanese because of course they don't have that much space in Japan to have warehouses like in other countries.

182
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:57,639
So what you're saying is they're producing goods just for the time they need it, right?

183
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:58,259
Exactly.

184
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,860
So trying to not be overstocked or have like a long lead time or something.

185
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
Long lead times where you have to keep something in a warehouse exactly.

186
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,740
So that's why it's so efficient.

187
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,259
And also it's about improving the efficiency between processes.

188
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,820
So what's sometimes called a bottleneck.

189
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:25,639
You can have really good processes in the beginning but in the end maybe you have only one workstation that's taking all these orders and everything gets bottled up and it causes delays.

190
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:35,779
So in the dialogue they want to implement the just in time strategy as a way of avoiding redundancies but it sounds to me like actually this might cause redundancies sometimes.

191
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,100
Well yeah, sometimes it does.

192
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:52,000
Sometimes when you make workstations more efficient or when you make all your processes work more fluidly, sometimes inevitably you will have to lay off some people that are redundant.

193
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,259
Okay, have you ever worked in a company where they've implemented just in time?

194
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:06,759
No, actually I've never really worked at a place where this philosophy was working but I did used to work at a place where we had Six Sigma which is kind of which is a little bit similar.

195
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,500
Yeah, well I guess we'll need a lesson on Six Sigma in the future.

196
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:18,200
Yeah, we'll see if we come up with Six Sigma and what it means and it's kind of interesting but we want to hear what you think.

197
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,360
Yes, have you guys worked in a place where they use just in time?

198
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:30,899
Exactly or if you have any quality control measures or how does your company avoid having defective items or defective services?

199
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:38,679
