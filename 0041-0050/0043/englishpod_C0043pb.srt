00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're going to be talking about a very special topic.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This topic was actually suggested by one of our listeners.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So keep those comments coming because we want to create lessons that you need, that you want.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what are we talking about today?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Today's lesson is about applying for a visa.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A very, very important topic.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And specifically, it's about a visa interview.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Exactly.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
As you all probably know, when you apply for a visa, especially for the U.S., you have an interview.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Where you have to answer some questions.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And that's what we're going to be talking about today.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, so let's talk about visa.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Right.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A visa, it's not a credit card.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, not visa or MasterCard.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So a visa is an official document that you get in your passport that allows you to travel legally to a country.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So with this document, you can go into a country.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, so we have different types of visas.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Today we're going to be talking about a B2 visa.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A B2 visa is a tourist visa.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
A tourist visa.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is only for the United States.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Other countries may have different classifications for their visas, but B2 is for the United States.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Right.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So Marco, we use a tourist visa when we want to be a tourist and just travel in the U.S.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What about a resident visa?

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, you can have a temporary resident visa.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Like for example, an F1.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
An F1 is for foreign exchange students who go and live in the States maybe for a year or do a MBA for two years or three years.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So that's an F1 visa.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can also get a J1 visa, which is a temporary exchange visitor.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So it could be to maybe do some temporary work for two or three months and then go back to your country.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So basically a resident visa allows you to live in that country.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, you can live in that country legally for a determined time.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where are we going to be exactly?

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In this dialogue, we're going to hear two people.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A visa officer and a person who's applying for the visa.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now, the person who's applying for the visa has an accent, right?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But this is really good practice for helping you to understand people with different accents.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Exactly.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the great vocabulary.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm going to visit my brother.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's just had a baby.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He lives in Minneapolis.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And who's sponsoring your trip?

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
My brother.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Here.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is an invitation letter from him.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
All right.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, I own a house.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have a car at home.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I know my job.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, I do have assets in my country.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Like I said, I own a house.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry, sir.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Congratulations!

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You win!

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Congratulations!

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All right.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What a lucky guy.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, he applied for a tourist visa and now he's getting a resident visa.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, that's great, but does this really happen?

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, no, that would never happen at a consulate.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, well, we can dream that this might happen for us.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
All right, let's take a look at the words in language takeaway today.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Language takeaway.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right, on language takeaway, we have sponsoring.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sponsoring.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sponsoring.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sponsoring.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So, Erika, what does it mean to sponsor somebody?

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When you sponsor somebody for a visa, you take care of them and make sure they have enough money.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, you are the one who's responsible for all of their expenses and making sure they just have enough money.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So, for example, when I was 16, I made a trip to another country and my parents were my sponsors.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So, they took responsibility for your money.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Exactly.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Invitation letter.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Invitation letter.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Invitation letter.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Invitation letter.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now, this is a really important part for a visa application.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes, very important.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What is an invitation letter?

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, an invitation letter is a formal letter that a friend or a relative or maybe a business writes to ask you to come to their country.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Exactly.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, you are being invited for a specific purpose to the United States.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, and you have to give this letter to the visa officer.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Invitation letter.

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Our next word.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ties.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ties.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ties.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ties.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Looks exactly like tie, like the one you wear in your suit.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Not quite the same, though.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, what are ties?

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The ties you have to your country are the things that keep you attached to your country.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That make sure that you will return to your country.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, what are some examples of ties?

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Like maybe a house or a wife or a child or maybe some money in your bank account.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Or a job even.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Perfect.

143
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A good way to think of this is imagine like a rope that's attached to you and tying you to your country, to your house, to your job, to your kids.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So, you can't run away.

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Exactly.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

150
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That was clear, but let's listen to some more examples of how we would use ties.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Example one.

152
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I sold my house and closed my bank account.

153
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't have any more ties to my home country.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Example two.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Alvin enjoyed being single.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He wasn't ready for the ties of family life.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Example three.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Diplomatic relations have improved.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And the ties between the two countries are stronger.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's clear now.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's look at our next word.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Financially independent.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Financially independent.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Financially independent.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Financially independent.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So that means that you don't need anyone.

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That you have enough money.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You have enough money for yourself.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Right.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, you don't have to ask your parents to pay for your ticket or pay for your food or whatever.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And our last word for today.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So, your assets are kind of like your ties.

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They're things of value that you own.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Things that are expensive that you own in your home country.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So it would be a house.

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yep.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A car.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yep.

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe stocks.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Or investments.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, all of those things are your assets.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So, we've seen a lot of great words and I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We're going to slow it down for you.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This will help you understand it a little bit better.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So, you're applying for a B2 visa.

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to visit my brother.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's just had a baby.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He lives in Minneapolis.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
See, here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And who is sponsoring your trip?

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
My brother.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Here.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is an invitation letter from him.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll stay with him and his family in their home.

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Alright.

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, I own a house.

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I have a car at home and, oh, my job.

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm employed by Thornhill as an engineer.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, I do have assets in my country.

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Like I said, I own a house.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry, sir.

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We cannot grant you a B-2 visa this time.

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Instead, you are granted a resident visa!

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Congratulations!

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa!

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You win!

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Congratulations!

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yay!

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, today we're not going to do our regular toolkit like Fluency Builder or putting it together.

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No, we're going to do something a little bit different today.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We're going to talk about the questions you will probably be asked at an interview for a U.S.

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
visa.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And the useful language that you can use to answer these questions in a good way.

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay, so let's take a look at our first question.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So this is probably going to be the first question the interviewer is going to ask you.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, so Marco, I know you have a lot of experience with U.S.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
visas.

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
How should we answer this question?

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, it depends on what you're doing, right?

237
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So if you're a tourist, you would say, I'm going on vacation to New York or anywhere.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Also, if you're visiting a family member, like in our dialogue, you would say, oh, I'm going to visit my sister or my brother or my cousin.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you're applying for a business visa, then you would say, oh, I'm going to visit a company or etc.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So you just have to say why you are going to the States.

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now is it important to be really specific?

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, the more specific you are, it's probably better.

243
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So if you can name the state and the city where you're going, it's much better.

244
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
All right.

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, let's listen to our next question.

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay, so this is a really important question also, because in your application, you have to put how long you plan to stay in the US, right?

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's a pretty straightforward answer, you know, two months, one month, three weeks, right?

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But you just have to make sure that your answer matches what's written in your application.

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay, now let's take a look at our last question.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, I think this is maybe the most important question that they'll ask you, right?

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, this is the most important question.

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This is what the interviewer is most interested in.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay, so why is he interested in this?

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because he has to be sure that you will not become an illegal immigrant to the United States.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So that you will return to your home country.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He or she has to be convinced that you're going to return to your home country.

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So how can you convince him?

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Basically by demonstrating your ties.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So showing the things that will pull you back to your home country.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So if you take documents to support this, bank statements, maybe a copy of your mortgage.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yep, like maybe your wedding certificate.

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wedding certificate, I don't know, even a letter from your office from your job.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So that shows that you have to return to your work.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The more things you bring the better, even though the interviewer might not ask for the documents.

270
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Okay, it's better to be safe, right?

271
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Exactly.

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So come with a huge file full of things.

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Exactly.

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I've had friends who've arrived to the embassy with a huge file of documents and weren't asked to show any of the documents.

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But other interviewers will maybe ask for it.

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue again.

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And you'll hear how our traveler answers these questions.

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So you're applying for a B2 visa, where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to visit my brother.

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He's just had a baby.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He lives in Minneapolis.

282
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And who's sponsoring your trip?

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
My brother.

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Here.

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This is an invitation letter from him.

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All right.

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, I own a house.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I have a car at home.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I know my job.

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer.

297
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, I do have assets in my country.

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Like I said, I own a house and see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sorry, sir.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

304
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Congratulations.

305
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You win.

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Congratulations.

308
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, I hope this was a useful lesson for all of our listeners, because I'm sure that in one point or another, in the future, you're going to apply for a visa.

309
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So now you know all the language that you need to more or less answer all these questions that you're going to be asked.

310
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And Marco, I'm sure that people have already applied for visas for the US, right?

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Probably, yeah.

312
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And I want to hear from our users any stories that they have about applying for a visa.

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, that would be great.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I know that I have some stories to share on the comments board, and we want to hear your questions and comments and any suggestions.

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So visit our website at EnglishPod.com, and Marco and I will be there to respond to you and answer your questions.

316
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, everyone, thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.
