00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,279
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,780
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,580
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:06,759
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,339
And today we're going to be talking about a very special topic.

6
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,300
That's right.

7
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,339
This topic was actually suggested by one of our listeners.

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,079
Exactly.

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,320
So keep those comments coming because we want to create lessons that you need, that you want.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:20,899
Exactly.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,960
So what are we talking about today?

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,339
Today's lesson is about applying for a visa.

13
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,620
A very, very important topic.

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,019
Yes.

15
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,859
And specifically, it's about a visa interview.

16
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:33,520
Exactly.

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,539
As you all probably know, when you apply for a visa, especially for the U.S., you have an interview.

18
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,100
Yes.

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,780
Where you have to answer some questions.

20
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:41,380
Yes.

21
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,299
And that's what we're going to be talking about today.

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,340
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,020
Okay, so let's talk about visa.

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,280
Right.

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,320
A visa, it's not a credit card.

26
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,039
No, not visa or MasterCard.

27
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,359
No.

28
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,879
So a visa is an official document that you get in your passport that allows you to travel legally to a country.

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,359
So with this document, you can go into a country.

30
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:11,819
Okay, so we have different types of visas.

31
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,939
Today we're going to be talking about a B2 visa.

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,439
A B2 visa is a tourist visa.

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,260
A tourist visa.

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,120
This is only for the United States.

35
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:26,500
Other countries may have different classifications for their visas, but B2 is for the United States.

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,859
Right.

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,180
So Marco, we use a tourist visa when we want to be a tourist and just travel in the U.S.

38
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,239
What about a resident visa?

39
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:37,040
Well, you can have a temporary resident visa.

40
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,519
Like for example, an F1.

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,359
An F1 is for foreign exchange students who go and live in the States maybe for a year or do a MBA for two years or three years.

42
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,159
So that's an F1 visa.

43
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,340
You can also get a J1 visa, which is a temporary exchange visitor.

44
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,180
So it could be to maybe do some temporary work for two or three months and then go back to your country.

45
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,439
So basically a resident visa allows you to live in that country.

46
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,539
Yeah, you can live in that country legally for a determined time.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,419
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue.

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,699
Where are we going to be exactly?

49
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,699
In this dialogue, we're going to hear two people.

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,719
A visa officer and a person who's applying for the visa.

51
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,400
Now, the person who's applying for the visa has an accent, right?

52
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:22,960
Yes.

53
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:28,520
But this is really good practice for helping you to understand people with different accents.

54
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,379
Exactly.

55
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,599
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and explain all the great vocabulary.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,219
So you're applying for a B2 visa.

57
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,479
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm going to visit my brother.

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,599
He's just had a baby.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,259
He lives in Minneapolis.

61
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,740
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,819
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

63
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,819
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

64
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,879
And who's sponsoring your trip?

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,360
My brother.

66
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:12,379
Here.

67
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,500
This is an invitation letter from him.

68
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,419
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,319
All right.

70
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,259
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

71
00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:23,840
Well, I own a house.

72
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,340
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

73
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,159
I have a car at home.

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,680
I know my job.

75
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,219
I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer.

76
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

77
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,979
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

78
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Well, I do have assets in my country.

79
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,939
Like I said, I own a house.

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,199
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

81
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:53,360
I'm sorry, sir.

82
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,379
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

83
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,379
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

84
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:58,139
Congratulations!

85
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,780
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

86
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,759
You win!

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,759
Congratulations!

88
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,180
All right.

89
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,080
What a lucky guy.

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,699
Yeah, he applied for a tourist visa and now he's getting a resident visa.

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,259
Yeah, that's great, but does this really happen?

92
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,980
No, no, that would never happen at a consulate.

93
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,360
Okay, well, we can dream that this might happen for us.

94
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,060
Yeah, exactly.

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,000
All right, let's take a look at the words in language takeaway today.

96
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,379
Language takeaway.

97
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,620
All right, on language takeaway, we have sponsoring.

98
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,199
Sponsoring.

99
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,560
Sponsoring.

100
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:39,699
Sponsoring.

101
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,920
So, Erika, what does it mean to sponsor somebody?

102
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:49,439
When you sponsor somebody for a visa, you take care of them and make sure they have enough money.

103
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:50,180
Okay.

104
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,500
So, you are the one who's responsible for all of their expenses and making sure they just have enough money.

105
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,199
Okay.

106
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:03,180
So, for example, when I was 16, I made a trip to another country and my parents were my sponsors.

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,420
So, they took responsibility for your money.

108
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:06,959
Exactly.

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,579
Okay.

110
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,220
Okay, let's look at our next word.

111
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:10,839
Invitation letter.

112
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,079
Invitation letter.

113
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,040
Invitation letter.

114
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,060
Invitation letter.

115
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,259
Now, this is a really important part for a visa application.

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Yes, very important.

117
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,019
What is an invitation letter?

118
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:31,360
Well, an invitation letter is a formal letter that a friend or a relative or maybe a business writes to ask you to come to their country.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,180
Exactly.

120
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,279
So, you are being invited for a specific purpose to the United States.

121
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,019
Yeah, and you have to give this letter to the visa officer.

122
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,399
Invitation letter.

123
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,000
Our next word.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,379
Ties.

125
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:46,480
Ties.

126
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,459
Ties.

127
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,100
Ties.

128
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,459
Looks exactly like tie, like the one you wear in your suit.

129
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:52,759
Not quite the same, though.

130
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:54,000
All right.

131
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,980
So, what are ties?

132
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:01,579
The ties you have to your country are the things that keep you attached to your country.

133
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,120
Okay.

134
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:04,439
That make sure that you will return to your country.

135
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,160
Okay.

136
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,360
So, what are some examples of ties?

137
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,519
Like maybe a house or a wife or a child or maybe some money in your bank account.

138
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,259
Okay.

139
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,319
Or a job even.

140
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:15,879
Okay.

141
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,300
Okay.

142
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,740
Perfect.

143
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,279
Yeah.

144
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:26,040
A good way to think of this is imagine like a rope that's attached to you and tying you to your country, to your house, to your job, to your kids.

145
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:26,480
Okay.

146
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,459
So, you can't run away.

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:27,959
Exactly.

148
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:28,660
Okay.

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,439
Okay.

150
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,560
That was clear, but let's listen to some more examples of how we would use ties.

151
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:35,629
Example one.

152
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,360
I sold my house and closed my bank account.

153
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,139
I don't have any more ties to my home country.

154
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,379
Example two.

155
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,819
Alvin enjoyed being single.

156
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
He wasn't ready for the ties of family life.

157
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,060
Example three.

158
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
Diplomatic relations have improved.

159
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,879
And the ties between the two countries are stronger.

160
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,980
All right.

161
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,699
It's clear now.

162
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:11,620
Let's look at our next word.

163
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,240
Financially independent.

164
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,060
Financially independent.

165
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,120
Financially independent.

166
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,240
Financially independent.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,240
So that means that you don't need anyone.

168
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,660
That you have enough money.

169
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,120
You have enough money for yourself.

170
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:24,560
Right.

171
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,920
So, you don't have to ask your parents to pay for your ticket or pay for your food or whatever.

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,480
Okay.

173
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,579
And our last word for today.

174
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:37,420
Okay.

175
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,759
So, your assets are kind of like your ties.

176
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:40,319
Right.

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,860
They're things of value that you own.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,439
Things that are expensive that you own in your home country.

179
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
So it would be a house.

180
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:47,000
Yep.

181
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,600
A car.

182
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:47,980
Yep.

183
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,959
Maybe stocks.

184
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,300
Or investments.

185
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,100
Okay.

186
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,180
So, all of those things are your assets.

187
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

188
00:07:54,019 --> 00:07:58,319
So, we've seen a lot of great words and I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

189
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,279
We're going to slow it down for you.

190
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:00,600
Yeah.

191
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,959
This will help you understand it a little bit better.

192
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,360
So, you're applying for a B2 visa.

193
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,459
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

194
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,259
I'm going to visit my brother.

195
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,199
He's just had a baby.

196
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,759
He lives in Minneapolis.

197
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,800
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

198
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,100
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

199
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,139
See, here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

200
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,120
And who is sponsoring your trip?

201
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:44,740
My brother.

202
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,159
Here.

203
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,539
This is an invitation letter from him.

204
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:52,500
I'll stay with him and his family in their home.

205
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,059
Alright.

206
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:57,139
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

207
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,379
Well, I own a house.

208
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,559
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

209
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:07,639
I have a car at home and, oh, my job.

210
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,759
I'm employed by Thornhill as an engineer.

211
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:17,539
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

212
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,320
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

213
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,700
Well, I do have assets in my country.

214
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,279
Like I said, I own a house.

215
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,879
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

216
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm sorry, sir.

217
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,159
We cannot grant you a B-2 visa this time.

218
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,620
Instead, you are granted a resident visa!

219
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,639
Congratulations!

220
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,940
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa!

221
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,220
You win!

222
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,500
Congratulations!

223
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,960
Yay!

224
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,879
Okay, today we're not going to do our regular toolkit like Fluency Builder or putting it together.

225
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:12,000
No, we're going to do something a little bit different today.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,419
We're going to talk about the questions you will probably be asked at an interview for a U.S.

227
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:17,659
visa.

228
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,320
And the useful language that you can use to answer these questions in a good way.

229
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,379
Okay, so let's take a look at our first question.

230
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,139
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

231
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,080
Where is your final destination and what is the purpose of your trip to the United States?

232
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,659
So this is probably going to be the first question the interviewer is going to ask you.

233
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,259
Yeah, so Marco, I know you have a lot of experience with U.S.

234
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,539
visas.

235
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,100
How should we answer this question?

236
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,019
Well, it depends on what you're doing, right?

237
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,700
So if you're a tourist, you would say, I'm going on vacation to New York or anywhere.

238
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:02,720
Also, if you're visiting a family member, like in our dialogue, you would say, oh, I'm going to visit my sister or my brother or my cousin.

239
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,600
If you're applying for a business visa, then you would say, oh, I'm going to visit a company or etc.

240
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,820
So you just have to say why you are going to the States.

241
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,080
Now is it important to be really specific?

242
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,620
Yeah, the more specific you are, it's probably better.

243
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,580
So if you can name the state and the city where you're going, it's much better.

244
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:20,580
All right.

245
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,179
Well, let's listen to our next question.

246
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:26,279
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

247
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:31,179
How long do you plan to remain in the United States?

248
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:40,519
Okay, so this is a really important question also, because in your application, you have to put how long you plan to stay in the US, right?

249
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,639
It's a pretty straightforward answer, you know, two months, one month, three weeks, right?

250
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,460
But you just have to make sure that your answer matches what's written in your application.

251
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,480
Yeah, exactly.

252
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,379
Okay, now let's take a look at our last question.

253
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:58,580
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

254
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,179
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

255
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,440
Well, I think this is maybe the most important question that they'll ask you, right?

256
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,639
Yeah, this is the most important question.

257
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,259
This is what the interviewer is most interested in.

258
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,960
Okay, so why is he interested in this?

259
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Because he has to be sure that you will not become an illegal immigrant to the United States.

260
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,860
So that you will return to your home country.

261
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:29,720
He or she has to be convinced that you're going to return to your home country.

262
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,539
So how can you convince him?

263
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,580
Basically by demonstrating your ties.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,879
So showing the things that will pull you back to your home country.

265
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,700
So if you take documents to support this, bank statements, maybe a copy of your mortgage.

266
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,899
Yep, like maybe your wedding certificate.

267
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,259
Wedding certificate, I don't know, even a letter from your office from your job.

268
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,399
So that shows that you have to return to your work.

269
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,220
The more things you bring the better, even though the interviewer might not ask for the documents.

270
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,779
Okay, it's better to be safe, right?

271
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,279
Exactly.

272
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,320
So come with a huge file full of things.

273
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,039
Exactly.

274
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,519
I've had friends who've arrived to the embassy with a huge file of documents and weren't asked to show any of the documents.

275
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,019
But other interviewers will maybe ask for it.

276
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:15,440
Okay, so now let's listen to the dialogue again.

277
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,220
And you'll hear how our traveler answers these questions.

278
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,980
So you're applying for a B2 visa, where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

279
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,019
I'm going to visit my brother.

280
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,100
He's just had a baby.

281
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,779
He lives in Minneapolis.

282
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,240
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

283
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,320
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

284
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,320
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

285
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,440
And who's sponsoring your trip?

286
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:54,860
My brother.

287
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,879
Here.

288
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,039
This is an invitation letter from him.

289
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,820
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

290
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,840
All right.

291
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,779
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

292
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,340
Well, I own a house.

293
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,860
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

294
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,679
I have a car at home.

295
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,200
I know my job.

296
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,740
I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer.

297
00:14:16,259 --> 00:14:21,019
Actually, I only have three weeks vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

298
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,480
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

299
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,279
Well, I do have assets in my country.

300
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,700
Like I said, I own a house and see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

301
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:36,879
I'm sorry, sir.

302
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,879
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

303
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,899
Instead, you are granted a resident visa.

304
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,639
Congratulations.

305
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:44,299
You are the millionth person to apply for a visa.

306
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,299
You win.

307
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:45,980
Congratulations.

308
00:14:50,319 --> 00:15:01,220
Well, I hope this was a useful lesson for all of our listeners, because I'm sure that in one point or another, in the future, you're going to apply for a visa.

309
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:07,799
So now you know all the language that you need to more or less answer all these questions that you're going to be asked.

310
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:12,740
And Marco, I'm sure that people have already applied for visas for the US, right?

311
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:13,840
Probably, yeah.

312
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,720
And I want to hear from our users any stories that they have about applying for a visa.

313
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,799
Yeah, that would be great.

314
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:27,279
I know that I have some stories to share on the comments board, and we want to hear your questions and comments and any suggestions.

315
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,059
So visit our website at EnglishPod.com, and Marco and I will be there to respond to you and answer your questions.

316
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,000
Well, everyone, thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.
