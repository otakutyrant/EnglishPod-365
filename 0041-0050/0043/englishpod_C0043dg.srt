EnglishPod.com So you're applying for a B2 visa.

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,320
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

3
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:16,359
I'm going to visit my brother.

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,440
He's just had a baby.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,120
He lives in Minneapolis.

6
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,600
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,679
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,980
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,740
And who's sponsoring your trip?

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,200
My brother.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,240
Here.

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
This is an invitation letter from him.

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,200
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,140
Alright.

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,140
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,700
Well, I own a house.

17
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,219
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

18
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,060
I have a car at home.

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,560
I know my job.

20
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,380
Actually, I only have a three-week vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,859
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,640
Well, I do have assets in my country.

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,799
Like I said, I own a house.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,040
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

26
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,219
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,239
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

28
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:21,239
Instead, you are granted a resident visa!
