EnglishPod.com So you're applying for a B2 visa.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Where's your final destination and what's the purpose of your trip to the United States?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to visit my brother.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He's just had a baby.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He lives in Minneapolis.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And how long do you plan to remain in the United States?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll be here for approximately three weeks.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So here's my return ticket for the 26th of March.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And who's sponsoring your trip?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My brother.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is an invitation letter from him.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I will stay with him and his family in their home.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Alright.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Tell me about the ties you have to your home country.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I own a house.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Actually, I'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I have a car at home.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I know my job.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm employed by Tornel as an engineer.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, I only have a three-week vacation, so I have to go back to work at the end of March.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, I do have assets in my country.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Like I said, I own a house.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And see, here's a bank statement showing my investments and my bank balance.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Instead, you are granted a resident visa!
