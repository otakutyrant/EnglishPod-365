EnglishPod.com Halb!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Are you a doctor?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh my gosh, help me!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I tried to perform CPR, but I just...

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, Frankie!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Somebody page Dr.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hauser?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Get the patient to hold still.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I can't get a pulse.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, he's on the monitor.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
His BP's falling.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He's flatlining.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No!

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Frankie!

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Doctor, do something!

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Someone get her out of here!

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Get me the defibrillator!

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, clear!

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Again, clear!

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Clear!

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I got a pulse.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, what's happening?

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think we're going to have to innovate.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
All right, tube's in.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Bag him.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's go!

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
People, move!

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Move!

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Doctor!

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, thank God!

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
How is he?

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He's still in critical condition.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.
