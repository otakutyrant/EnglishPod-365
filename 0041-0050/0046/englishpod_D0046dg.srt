EnglishPod.com Halb!

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,400
Are you a doctor?

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,240
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,859
Oh my gosh, help me!

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,399
I tried to perform CPR, but I just...

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,059
I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

7
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,120
Oh, Frankie!

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,960
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

9
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,300
Somebody page Dr.

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:24,719
Hauser?

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,280
Get the patient to hold still.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,339
I can't get a pulse.

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,699
Okay, he's on the monitor.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,119
His BP's falling.

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:34,320
He's flatlining.

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,259
No!

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,679
Frankie!

18
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,859
Doctor, do something!

19
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:41,060
Someone get her out of here!

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,740
Get me the defibrillator!

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,679
Okay, clear!

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,060
Again, clear!

23
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,079
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:50,920
Clear!

25
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,299
I got a pulse.

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,899
Okay, what's happening?

27
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,320
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

28
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,659
I think we're going to have to innovate.

29
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,840
All right, tube's in.

30
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,359
Bag him.

31
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,560
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,459
Let's go!

33
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,340
People, move!

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:05,920
Move!

35
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,260
Doctor!

36
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,599
Oh, thank God!

37
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,060
How is he?

38
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,439
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

39
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,540
He's still in critical condition.

40
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,439
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,319
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

42
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,500
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

43
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,200
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.
