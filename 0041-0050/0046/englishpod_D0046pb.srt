1
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,279
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,299
Welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,099
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,080
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,359
And today we're going to be talking about an ER, an emergency room.

6
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:11,939
Exactly.

7
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,279
We're bringing you our very own ER drama here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,559
Yeah, doctor shows are very popular with people, medical terms and all that stuff.

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, so we're going to teach you some words that you might hear commonly in medical shows on TV or in movies.

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,579
This is really common language in television.

11
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:30,879
Or even at a hospital, right?

12
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:34,119
Well yeah, but let's hope our listeners don't have to face this.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,799
Okay, so let's preview some words in vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:38,960
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,299
Alright, so what's our first word?

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,060
Okay, the first word is CPR.

17
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,240
CPR.

18
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:46,100
CPR.

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,259
So that's pretty easy.

20
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:47,899
What does that mean?

21
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,719
Well, it's short for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

22
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:53,659
Okay.

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,640
If that means anything to you.

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,340
Well, cardio is related to the heart.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,880
Pulmonary refers to the lungs.

26
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,280
Yep.

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,439
Resuscitation means to come back to life.

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:04,879
Yes.

29
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:13,019
So basically CPR is, you know when someone stops breathing, you put your mouth on their mouth and you breathe inside their lungs.

30
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,120
Okay, to give them air.

31
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:14,659
Yeah.

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,739
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:16,920
So CPR.

34
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,939
That's CPR.

35
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:18,599
Okay.

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,579
So let's take a look at our next word.

37
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,099
BP.

38
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:21,920
BP.

39
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,879
So BP is short for blood pressure.

40
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,400
Blood pressure.

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,799
That's just the way that doctors use it in the emergency room.

42
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:29,200
Exactly.

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,799
Pretty simple.

44
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,340
Okay, so blood pressure.

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,120
And our last word.

46
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,340
Acute respiratory failure.

47
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:36,980
Acute respiratory failure.

48
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,019
So what is that exactly?

49
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:39,920
That sounds complicated.

50
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,140
Basically, it's really serious that you stop breathing.

51
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,219
You stop breathing?

52
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,519
Yeah.

53
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay.

54
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,239
So if you go into acute respiratory failure, then the doctor or somebody has to perform CPR.

55
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:53,939
Right.

56
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,099
Alright, cool.

57
00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:58,840
Okay, so we've previewed these three great words.

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,180
Now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,040
It's going to be really fast and you're going to have a lot of drama in it, so don't worry if you don't understand everything.

60
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,139
Yeah, we're going to come back and teach you some of the important language.

61
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:18,259
Help!

62
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,199
Are you a doctor?

63
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,039
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

64
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,680
Oh my gosh, help me.

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,919
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

66
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,939
Oh, Frankie.

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,800
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

68
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:37,099
Somebody page Dr.

69
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,539
Hauser.

70
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,139
Get the patient to hold still.

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,219
I can't get a pulse.

72
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,520
Okay, he's on the monitor.

73
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,939
His BP's falling.

74
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:47,139
He's flatlining.

75
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,580
No, Frankie!

76
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,699
Doctor, do something!

77
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,879
Someone get her out of here.

78
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,599
Get me the defibrillator.

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay, clear.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,900
Again, clear.

81
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,900
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

82
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:03,759
Clear!

83
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,099
I got a pulse.

84
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,719
Okay, what's happening?

85
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,139
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

86
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,460
I think we're going to have to innovate.

87
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:13,639
Alright, tube's in.

88
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,139
Bag him.

89
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,379
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

90
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,759
Let's go, people, move, move!

91
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,099
Doctor!

92
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,419
Oh, thank God!

93
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,879
How is he?

94
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,259
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

95
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,379
He's still in critical condition.

96
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,240
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

97
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,139
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

98
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,319
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

99
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,000
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

100
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,960
Wow, so much drama over a little hamster.

101
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,080
Yeah, a little pet, eh?

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,639
A little pet, the little hamster.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,439
Well, you know what, I can relate to this owner and I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that later.

104
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,520
Yeah, I know you have a really good story about this.

105
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:11,139
Yeah, but in the meantime, let's look at some great language in Language Takeaway.

106
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:13,900
Language Takeaway.

107
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:17,839
Alright, so let's take a look at our first word.

108
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,100
Intubate.

109
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,120
Intubate.

110
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:21,240
Intubate.

111
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,339
So this is a medical procedure.

112
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,079
Exactly.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,639
When a patient can't breathe properly, sometimes the doctor takes a long tube and puts it into their mouth and down their pipes, I guess, down their breathing tube, so that they can breathe better.

114
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,120
Okay, so that's to intubate.

115
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:40,480
Yes.

116
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,040
Okay, so once they've intubated the patient, they start to bag him.

117
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:50,699
Yeah, they put a bag over the person's head or something?

118
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:50,939
No.

119
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,060
So there's a bag attached to this intubation tube and you squeeze it to put air into the lungs.

120
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,420
Okay, so you squeeze this bag and it puts air through the tube.

121
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
I think this is just medical slang.

122
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:04,779
Yeah, I guess bag him.

123
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,319
Yeah, but you hear it all the time on TV, so it's important our listeners know it.

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,439
Okay, let's look at our next word.

125
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,620
Critical condition.

126
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:12,759
Critical condition.

127
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,600
Critical condition means it's serious.

128
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:27,060
Right, if a patient is in critical condition, they're either really, really hurt or really, really sick and they could die pretty soon.

129
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,180
Okay, so you don't want to be in critical condition.

130
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:30,560
No.

131
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,500
Let's take a look at our next word.

132
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,620
Stabilize.

133
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,660
Stabilize.

134
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:35,899
Stabilize.

135
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:36,699
Stabilize.

136
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,040
So when the doctor stabilize a patient, they take that patient out of danger.

137
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,759
Exactly.

138
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:46,600
When a patient is stabilized, they probably won't die in 5 minutes.

139
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:47,180
Okay.

140
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,899
But they could still be really sick, they could be in critical condition, right?

141
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,779
But it's under control.

142
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,500
Exactly.

143
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,040
Okay.

144
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,439
Yeah.

145
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:54,459
Stabilize.

146
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,180
Let's look at our last word.

147
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:57,259
ICU.

148
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,680
ICU.

149
00:05:59,379 --> 00:05:59,819
ICU.

150
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,240
Intensive care unit.

151
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,720
Okay, that's what it means.

152
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,339
Intensive care unit.

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:04,699
Yep.

154
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,360
So that's the place where patients who are in critical condition are taken.

155
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,060
Right.

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,319
So what's the difference between an ICU and a regular room?

157
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,199
Well, I don't know, I've never been in one.

158
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:23,939
But I think like patients are monitored regularly and I think there's, you know, maybe more, maybe there are more nurses and fewer patients.

159
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,800
There's just a higher level of care.

160
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,000
A higher level of care.

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,279
Yeah.

162
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,120
Okay.

163
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,220
Okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

164
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:37,079
Now try to catch all of these medical terms that we've just talked about and then we'll come back and explain a few phrases.

165
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,160
Help!

166
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,480
Are you a doctor?

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,300
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

168
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,939
Oh my gosh, help me.

169
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,139
I tried to perform CPR but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

170
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,220
Oh, Frankie.

171
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,060
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

172
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,399
Somebody page Dr.

173
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:56,800
Hauser.

174
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,399
Get the patient to hold still.

175
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,459
I can't get a pulse.

176
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,839
Okay, he's on the monitor.

177
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,240
His BP is falling.

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,459
He's flatlining.

179
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
No, Frankie!

180
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,060
Doctor, do something!

181
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,139
Someone get her out of here.

182
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,839
Get me the defibrillator.

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,779
Okay, clear.

184
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,120
Again, clear.

185
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,180
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

186
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:22,980
Clear.

187
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
I've got a pulse.

188
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,959
Okay, what's happening?

189
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,379
The patient is in acute respiratory failure.

190
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,720
I think we're going to have to innovate.

191
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,860
All right, tube's in.

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,399
Bag him.

193
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:35,639
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

194
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:36,500
Let's go!

195
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,420
People, move!

196
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,000
Move!

197
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,139
Doctor, oh thank God!

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,620
How is he?

199
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,980
We've managed to stabilize Frankie but he's not out of the woods yet.

200
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,079
He's still in critical condition.

201
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,019
We're moving him to intensive care but...

202
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:54,839
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

203
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,040
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

204
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,680
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

205
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,339
Okay, so there are some really good phrasal verbs in this dialogue.

206
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,959
Yeah, a couple of good phrasal verbs.

207
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,259
Okay, so let's take a look at these phrasal verbs in Putting It Together.

208
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,100
Putting it together.

209
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,639
All right, so what's our first phrasal verb today?

210
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,759
Hook up.

211
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,639
Hook up.

212
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:23,459
Hook up.

213
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,420
So to hook up.

214
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,080
So when we talk about hooking something up, we are usually talking about electronics, right Marco?

215
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,779
Yeah, you usually hook up your TV or your computer.

216
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,840
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we would use hook up.

217
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,220
I finally got a Nintendo Wii!

218
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,740
Come on, help me hook it up to the TV.

219
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,580
Example 3.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,600
I just hooked up my new HDTV.

221
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:11,600
Want to come over and watch a movie?

222
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,919
Great, so you can see that there are a few different variations of this pattern here with the word hook up because it's a phrasal verb.

223
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:22,639
Exactly.

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,620
And I think the same patterns can apply to our next phrasal verb.

225
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,080
Hold still.

226
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,080
Hold still.

227
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,580
Hold still.

228
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,379
Hold still.

229
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,580
So the doctor needed the patient to hold still.

230
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:35,940
Right, to stop moving.

231
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,580
Stop moving, exactly.

232
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,399
Okay, let's listen to some more examples of hold still because, again, it's a really great phrasal verb that you can change up a little bit.

233
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,259
Example 1.

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,419
If you don't hold still, I can't see if you have something in your eye.

235
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,100
Example 2.

236
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,080
Hold still while she cuts your hair or else she might make a mistake.

237
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,759
Example 3.

238
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,240
Hold still, you have a bee on your back.

239
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,539
Okay, hold still.

240
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:27,220
Great word.

241
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Yep.

242
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,200
Alright, one final phrase for you.

243
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,379
Out of the woods.

244
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:33,259
Out of the woods.

245
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,259
Out of the woods.

246
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,340
Out of the woods.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,879
So when someone's out of the woods, they're free from danger.

248
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:39,720
Safe.

249
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,539
I guess it's kind of a saying, like, I'm out of the woods, I'm free, I'm safe.

250
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,539
I guess there are two variants of this phrase.

251
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,539
We can say, I'm out of the woods, or we're out of the woods, or I guess we're not out of the woods yet.

252
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,980
So, okay, out of the woods.

253
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,600
Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again and when we come back, Eric is going to tell us about her ER story.

254
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,240
Help!

255
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,600
Are you a doctor?

256
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,419
My poor little Frankie, he's just stopped breathing.

257
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,059
Oh my gosh, help me.

258
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,259
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

259
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,299
Oh, Frankie!

260
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,159
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

261
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,500
Somebody page Dr.

262
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:30,919
Hauser?

263
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,500
Get the patient to hold still.

264
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,600
I can't get a pulse.

265
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,899
Okay, he's on the monitor.

266
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,320
His BP's falling.

267
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:40,519
He's flatlining.

268
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:41,500
No!

269
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,879
Frankie!

270
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,039
Doctor, do something!

271
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,259
Someone get her out of here.

272
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,960
Get me the defibrillator.

273
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,879
Okay, clear.

274
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,259
Again, clear.

275
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,279
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

276
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,139
Clear!

277
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,500
I got a pulse.

278
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,100
Okay, what's happening?

279
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,519
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

280
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,860
I think we're going to have to innovate.

281
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,059
Alright, tube's in.

282
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:07,559
Bag him.

283
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,759
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

284
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,259
Let's go, people, move, move!

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,799
Doctor, oh thank God!

286
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,299
How is he?

287
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,639
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

288
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,759
He's still in critical condition.

289
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,019
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

290
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,519
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

291
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,700
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

292
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,460
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

293
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, Erica, so what happened?

294
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,440
What emergency did you have?

295
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,860
Well, it was with my cat.

296
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:50,639
Your cat?

297
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,019
Yes.

298
00:12:51,240 --> 00:13:04,740
I had some people over for dinner, and it was maybe 1.30 in the morning, and I went downstairs to let them out and show them where the taxis were, and then I came up and I saw that the cat was gone, and it turned out that the cat fell out of the window.

299
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
Fell out of the window?

300
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,840
Alright, but our listeners have to know what story or what floor do you live on?

301
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,740
The 20th floor.

302
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,659
The 20th.

303
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,840
Yeah, so this is really dangerous, right?

304
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
That's really high up.

305
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,059
So I went outside, and I was calling for my cat, and I was like, Mr.

306
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,200
Finn, where are you?

307
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,279
How did you know he fell out?

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,940
I just knew.

309
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah?

310
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,559
Mother's instinct.

311
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:39,399
I guess so, and so he was calling back to me, and so I picked him up and brought him to the house, and we had to bring him to the vet, and it was 2.30, 3.00 in the morning at this time, and the vet was not very happy that we woke him up out of bed.

312
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,879
But that was a really good emergency, though.

313
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,659
Yeah, so anyway, we brought him to the vet.

314
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:52,879
He was in critical condition for a couple of days, and then we had to keep him in the vet's ICU for about a week.

315
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:06,460
He broke his back, he broke two of his legs, and so he was in the hospital for three weeks, and then at home on bed rest for another three weeks, but now he's good as new.

316
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,159
Good as new.

317
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,539
Yeah.

318
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:10,059
He used up one of his seven lives.

319
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:10,740
Nine lives.

320
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,039
Nine?

321
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:11,440
Nine.

322
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:13,980
Yeah, I think maybe eight of his nine lives.

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
Eight, he's only got one left.

324
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:15,700
Yeah.

325
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,200
Wow, that's an interesting story.

326
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,159
I guess that's the inspiration under this dialogue.

327
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:20,879
Exactly.

328
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,240
Sometimes we Anglos really treat our cats and our hamsters and our dogs like they're our children.

329
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,799
Yeah, yeah, no, that's good.

330
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,100
Well, I'm glad Mr.

331
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,340
Finn is okay and he's walking and good as new.

332
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,179
Yep, good as new.

333
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,039
So maybe our users have some stories about their pets being taken to the hospital.

334
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:39,740
I want to hear.

335
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,100
Yeah, that should be interesting.

336
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:52,179
I've never had a pet actually break a leg or anything, so I don't have any pet stories this time, but we want to hear what you think, so come to EnglishPod.com, leave all your questions and comments and your stories.

337
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,240
And we'll be there to answer them.

338
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,500
Well, guys, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
