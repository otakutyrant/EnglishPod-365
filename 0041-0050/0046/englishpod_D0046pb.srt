1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to another great lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be talking about an ER, an emergency room.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Exactly.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're bringing you our very own ER drama here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, doctor shows are very popular with people, medical terms and all that stuff.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, so we're going to teach you some words that you might hear commonly in medical shows on TV or in movies.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is really common language in television.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Or even at a hospital, right?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well yeah, but let's hope our listeners don't have to face this.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, so let's preview some words in vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Alright, so what's our first word?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, the first word is CPR.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
CPR.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
CPR.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So that's pretty easy.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What does that mean?

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, it's short for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If that means anything to you.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, cardio is related to the heart.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Pulmonary refers to the lungs.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yep.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Resuscitation means to come back to life.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So basically CPR is, you know when someone stops breathing, you put your mouth on their mouth and you breathe inside their lungs.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, to give them air.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, okay.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So CPR.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's CPR.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So let's take a look at our next word.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
BP.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
BP.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So BP is short for blood pressure.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Blood pressure.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's just the way that doctors use it in the emergency room.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Exactly.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Pretty simple.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, so blood pressure.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And our last word.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Acute respiratory failure.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Acute respiratory failure.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So what is that exactly?

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That sounds complicated.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Basically, it's really serious that you stop breathing.

51
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You stop breathing?

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So if you go into acute respiratory failure, then the doctor or somebody has to perform CPR.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Right.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright, cool.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay, so we've previewed these three great words.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's going to be really fast and you're going to have a lot of drama in it, so don't worry if you don't understand everything.

60
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, we're going to come back and teach you some of the important language.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Help!

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you a doctor?

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh my gosh, help me.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, Frankie.

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Somebody page Dr.

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hauser.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Get the patient to hold still.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't get a pulse.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, he's on the monitor.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His BP's falling.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's flatlining.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, Frankie!

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Doctor, do something!

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Someone get her out of here.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Get me the defibrillator.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, clear.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Again, clear.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Clear!

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I got a pulse.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, what's happening?

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think we're going to have to innovate.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Alright, tube's in.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Bag him.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go, people, move, move!

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Doctor!

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Oh, thank God!

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How is he?

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's still in critical condition.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wow, so much drama over a little hamster.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, a little pet, eh?

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
A little pet, the little hamster.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, you know what, I can relate to this owner and I'm going to tell you a little bit more about that later.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, I know you have a really good story about this.

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, but in the meantime, let's look at some great language in Language Takeaway.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Language Takeaway.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Alright, so let's take a look at our first word.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Intubate.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Intubate.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Intubate.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So this is a medical procedure.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Exactly.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
When a patient can't breathe properly, sometimes the doctor takes a long tube and puts it into their mouth and down their pipes, I guess, down their breathing tube, so that they can breathe better.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, so that's to intubate.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

116
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, so once they've intubated the patient, they start to bag him.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, they put a bag over the person's head or something?

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So there's a bag attached to this intubation tube and you squeeze it to put air into the lungs.

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay, so you squeeze this bag and it puts air through the tube.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think this is just medical slang.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah, I guess bag him.

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, but you hear it all the time on TV, so it's important our listeners know it.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Critical condition.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Critical condition.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Critical condition means it's serious.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Right, if a patient is in critical condition, they're either really, really hurt or really, really sick and they could die pretty soon.

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, so you don't want to be in critical condition.

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No.

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's take a look at our next word.

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Stabilize.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Stabilize.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Stabilize.

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Stabilize.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So when the doctor stabilize a patient, they take that patient out of danger.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Exactly.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
When a patient is stabilized, they probably won't die in 5 minutes.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But they could still be really sick, they could be in critical condition, right?

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But it's under control.

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Exactly.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Stabilize.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's look at our last word.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
ICU.

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
ICU.

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
ICU.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Intensive care unit.

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, that's what it means.

152
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Intensive care unit.

153
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yep.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So that's the place where patients who are in critical condition are taken.

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Right.

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So what's the difference between an ICU and a regular room?

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, I don't know, I've never been in one.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But I think like patients are monitored regularly and I think there's, you know, maybe more, maybe there are more nurses and fewer patients.

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's just a higher level of care.

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A higher level of care.

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yeah.

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, so it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now try to catch all of these medical terms that we've just talked about and then we'll come back and explain a few phrases.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Help!

166
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you a doctor?

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
My poor little Frankie has just stopped breathing.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh my gosh, help me.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I tried to perform CPR but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

170
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, Frankie.

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

172
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Somebody page Dr.

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hauser.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Get the patient to hold still.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't get a pulse.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, he's on the monitor.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
His BP is falling.

178
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's flatlining.

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, Frankie!

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Doctor, do something!

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Someone get her out of here.

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Get me the defibrillator.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, clear.

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Again, clear.

185
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Clear.

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I've got a pulse.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, what's happening?

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The patient is in acute respiratory failure.

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think we're going to have to innovate.

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, tube's in.

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Bag him.

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

194
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go!

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
People, move!

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Move!

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Doctor, oh thank God!

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How is he?

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We've managed to stabilize Frankie but he's not out of the woods yet.

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's still in critical condition.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We're moving him to intensive care but...

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

205
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, so there are some really good phrasal verbs in this dialogue.

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, a couple of good phrasal verbs.

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so let's take a look at these phrasal verbs in Putting It Together.

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Putting it together.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right, so what's our first phrasal verb today?

210
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hook up.

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hook up.

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hook up.

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So to hook up.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So when we talk about hooking something up, we are usually talking about electronics, right Marco?

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, you usually hook up your TV or your computer.

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we would use hook up.

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I finally got a Nintendo Wii!

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come on, help me hook it up to the TV.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Example 3.

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I just hooked up my new HDTV.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Want to come over and watch a movie?

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Great, so you can see that there are a few different variations of this pattern here with the word hook up because it's a phrasal verb.

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Exactly.

224
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And I think the same patterns can apply to our next phrasal verb.

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hold still.

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hold still.

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hold still.

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hold still.

229
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So the doctor needed the patient to hold still.

230
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right, to stop moving.

231
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Stop moving, exactly.

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, let's listen to some more examples of hold still because, again, it's a really great phrasal verb that you can change up a little bit.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Example 1.

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
If you don't hold still, I can't see if you have something in your eye.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Example 2.

236
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hold still while she cuts your hair or else she might make a mistake.

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Example 3.

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hold still, you have a bee on your back.

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, hold still.

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Great word.

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yep.

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Alright, one final phrase for you.

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Out of the woods.

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Out of the woods.

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Out of the woods.

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Out of the woods.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So when someone's out of the woods, they're free from danger.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Safe.

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I guess it's kind of a saying, like, I'm out of the woods, I'm free, I'm safe.

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I guess there are two variants of this phrase.

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We can say, I'm out of the woods, or we're out of the woods, or I guess we're not out of the woods yet.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So, okay, out of the woods.

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, so now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again and when we come back, Eric is going to tell us about her ER story.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Help!

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Are you a doctor?

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My poor little Frankie, he's just stopped breathing.

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh my gosh, help me.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I tried to perform CPR, but I just, I don't know if I could get any air into his lungs.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, Frankie!

260
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Ellen, get him hooked up to a monitor.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Somebody page Dr.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hauser?

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Get the patient to hold still.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can't get a pulse.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay, he's on the monitor.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
His BP's falling.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He's flatlining.

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No!

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Frankie!

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Doctor, do something!

271
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Someone get her out of here.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Get me the defibrillator.

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, clear.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Again, clear.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come on, dammit, I'm not letting go of you.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Clear!

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I got a pulse.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay, what's happening?

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Patient is in acute respiratory failure.

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I think we're going to have to innovate.

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Alright, tube's in.

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Bag him.

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Somebody give him 10 cc's shot of adrenaline.

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go, people, move, move!

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Doctor, oh thank God!

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How is he?

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We've managed to stabilize Frankie, but he's not out of the woods yet.

288
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He's still in critical condition.

289
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We're moving him to intensive care, but...

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Doctor, just do whatever it takes.

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I just want my little Frankie to be okay.

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I couldn't imagine life without my little hamster.

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, Erica, so what happened?

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What emergency did you have?

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, it was with my cat.

296
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Your cat?

297
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes.

298
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I had some people over for dinner, and it was maybe 1.30 in the morning, and I went downstairs to let them out and show them where the taxis were, and then I came up and I saw that the cat was gone, and it turned out that the cat fell out of the window.

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Fell out of the window?

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Alright, but our listeners have to know what story or what floor do you live on?

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The 20th floor.

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The 20th.

303
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, so this is really dangerous, right?

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's really high up.

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So I went outside, and I was calling for my cat, and I was like, Mr.

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Finn, where are you?

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
How did you know he fell out?

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I just knew.

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yeah?

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Mother's instinct.

311
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I guess so, and so he was calling back to me, and so I picked him up and brought him to the house, and we had to bring him to the vet, and it was 2.30, 3.00 in the morning at this time, and the vet was not very happy that we woke him up out of bed.

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But that was a really good emergency, though.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah, so anyway, we brought him to the vet.

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He was in critical condition for a couple of days, and then we had to keep him in the vet's ICU for about a week.

315
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He broke his back, he broke two of his legs, and so he was in the hospital for three weeks, and then at home on bed rest for another three weeks, but now he's good as new.

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Good as new.

317
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He used up one of his seven lives.

319
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Nine lives.

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Nine?

321
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Nine.

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, I think maybe eight of his nine lives.

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Eight, he's only got one left.

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Wow, that's an interesting story.

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I guess that's the inspiration under this dialogue.

327
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Exactly.

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sometimes we Anglos really treat our cats and our hamsters and our dogs like they're our children.

329
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, yeah, no, that's good.

330
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Well, I'm glad Mr.

331
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Finn is okay and he's walking and good as new.

332
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yep, good as new.

333
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So maybe our users have some stories about their pets being taken to the hospital.

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I want to hear.

335
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, that should be interesting.

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've never had a pet actually break a leg or anything, so I don't have any pet stories this time, but we want to hear what you think, so come to EnglishPod.com, leave all your questions and comments and your stories.

337
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And we'll be there to answer them.

338
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, guys, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
