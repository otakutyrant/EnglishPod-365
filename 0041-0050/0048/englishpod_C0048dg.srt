00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com I can't believe we're here!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Carnival in Rio!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Seriously, this is like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Can you believe it?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're here at the biggest party in the world!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I know!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're so lucky we found tickets for the samba drum.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Look!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's starting!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Wow, this is amazing!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Look at how many dancers there are!

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful!

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is so cool!

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious samba schools in Rio.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No kidding!

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Look at them!

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They're amazing!

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Look at that girl on top of that float!

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
She must be the Carnival Queen!

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay!

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hurry up!

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Take the picture!

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, really?

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, I can't.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Really, I don't know how to dance.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Honey, I'll see you later!

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Patrick, don't just leave me here!
