00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:08,699
EnglishPod.com I can't believe we're here!

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,419
Carnival in Rio!

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,660
Seriously, this is like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,140
Can you believe it?

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,839
We're here at the biggest party in the world!

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:19,620
I know!

7
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,280
We're so lucky we found tickets for the samba drum.

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,199
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:24,940
Look!

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,000
It's starting!

11
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,780
Wow, this is amazing!

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,339
Look at how many dancers there are!

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,520
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful!

14
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:34,899
This is so cool!

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious samba schools in Rio.

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:41,240
No kidding!

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,299
Look at them!

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,219
They're amazing!

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,679
Look at that girl on top of that float!

20
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,119
She must be the Carnival Queen!

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,200
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,979
Okay!

23
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:53,359
Hurry up!

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,079
Take the picture!

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,939
Oh, really?

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:58,899
No, I can't.

27
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:01,020
Really, I don't know how to dance.

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:03,780
Honey, I'll see you later!

29
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,439
Patrick, don't just leave me here!
