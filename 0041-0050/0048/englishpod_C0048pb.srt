00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm Erika.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And today we're at a party.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, this is a great, exciting, fun, energetic lesson.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're at the biggest party in the world, Carnival in Rio.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay so Rio, this is the name of a city, right?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, this is a city in Brazil called Rio de Janeiro.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So Rio de Janeiro.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, different pronunciations, right?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It sounds a lot more, I don't know, authentic than mine.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we sometimes refer to it as Rio just to make it shorter.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, I think that's actually the most common way it's referred to in English.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, Rio.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's just like if you would say Los Angeles, you would say LA.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, or if you're talking about Kuala Lumpur, you might say KL.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Same idea.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, so we have some words that we're going to preview before we listen to our dialogue.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, in vocabulary preview we have one word, sambadrome.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sambadrome.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sambadrome.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sambadrome.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is actually a building.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So it's a proper noun, not a common noun, right?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, it's not really a common noun.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's a proper noun, but it is a building.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And what happens in this building?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Basically, it's very similar to a stadium, but each end isn't closed off.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So you have stands on one side and stands on the other, and you have like a little street in the middle.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So you can sit down and you can watch people parade or walk by, and you can see the dancers and everything.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And so what is it used for?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The sambadrome is used so that the samba schools can present their dances and their dancers and their costumes to judges and all the people that want to watch them dance samba.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So you've been using this word a lot.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Samba.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is this?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Samba is a type of dance that Brazil is famous for.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a very fast dance, a lot of hip movements, a lot of...

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's very fast, but it's very, very nice.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And the music is based with many different type of tropical instruments.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So it's really, really fun.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can you samba?

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can samba a little bit.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's kind of hard.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's trickier than what it seems.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, we're actually going to hear some samba music in the dialogue, right?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Exactly.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We're going to hear some samba that is actually used during carnival.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So...

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So let's go to Rio now and listen to some samba.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't believe we're here.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Carnival in Rio.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Seriously.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Can you believe it?

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We're so lucky we found tickets for the samba drum.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Look.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's starting.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wow.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is amazing.

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Look at how many dancers there are.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh my gosh.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The costumes are so colorful.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is so cool.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious samba schools in Rio.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No kidding.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Look at them.

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They're amazing.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Look at that girl on top of that float.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She must be the carnival queen.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay.

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hurry up.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Take the picture.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh really?

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't.

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Really.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't know how to dance.

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Honey, I'll see you later.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What a lucky guy.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He got asked out to dance by a beautiful Brazilian samba dancer.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I know.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't think his wife was very happy though.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, we've got some language about carnival in Rio, right?

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Exactly.

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So let's look at that now with language takeaway.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Language takeaway.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
All right.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Our first word on language takeaway today.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ticket scalper.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ticket scalper.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ticket scalper.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Ticket scalper.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is actually a job title, I think.

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Maybe not a totally legal job title.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Exactly.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So what does a ticket scalper do?

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Basically, this person will sell tickets at a higher price to people who don't have tickets.

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So he buys like 100 tickets.

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Right.

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And goes and stands outside of the samba drum or the- And he sells them for like twice the price, right?

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, that's a ticket scalper.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Actually, they come in handy sometimes because you want to go to a concert or something and you don't have tickets, you got to turn to them, right?

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Right.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Our next word, prestigious.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Prestigious.

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Prestigious.

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Prestigious.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Prestigious.

125
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now, this is a very nice word, prestigious.

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Before we explain anything, let's listen to some examples.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Example one.

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Harvard University is one of the most prestigious schools in North America.

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Example two.

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The Academy Award is the most prestigious prize an actor can get in the film industry.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Example three.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He worked really hard and now he is a very prestigious heart surgeon.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I can see that when something is prestigious, it's really well respected, right?

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's well known, well respected.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And you can- And if you are part of this thing, you can feel a sense of pride.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Right.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Prestige.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay, now let's take a look at our last word.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Float.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Float.

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Float.

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now, this doesn't mean like to float in water, right?

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, this is a noun, not a verb.

144
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's kind of hard to describe actually.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, it is hard to describe.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A float is something that you commonly see in parades.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So it would be like a car, but you can't really see the car.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, because it's covered with decoration.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
With big decorations and it's made to look like an artificial island.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, or a tree maybe.

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So you have people standing on there and dancing or waving.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We'll definitely post a picture of a float on our comment section so you can see what a float looks like.

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

156
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue again.

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can understand all of these words we've just talked about.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I know!

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're so lucky that we found tickets for the Sambadrome.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look!

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's starting!

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Wow!

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is amazing!

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Look at how many dancers there are!

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh my gosh!

167
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The costumes are so colorful!

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is so cool!

169
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious Samba schools in Rio.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No kidding!

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Look at them!

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're amazing!

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look at that girl on top of that float!

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She must be the Carnival Queen.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up!

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Take the picture!

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, really?

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, I can't.

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, really, I don't know how to dance.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Honey, I'll see you later!

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't just leave me here!

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Alright, we're back.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So now I think we should take a look at some of the phrases.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, let's go to Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Alright.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Fluency Builder.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So we have this phrase, once in a lifetime.

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Once in a lifetime.

191
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Once in a lifetime.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Once in a lifetime.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So this is an expression you would use to say that it doesn't happen very often.

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, it's a really special event.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Or a once in a lifetime chance.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Once in a lifetime.

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's look at our next phrase.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Good thing.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Good thing.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Good thing.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Good thing.

204
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So we have some examples for good thing.

205
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why don't we listen to them and then we'll come back.

206
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a good thing that I bought my house before the prices went up.

207
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Good thing I had money in my wallet.

208
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're happy you had money in your wallet.

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You could also maybe use it as a negative, right?

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Like, good thing I didn't go.

211
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right, I'm happy I didn't go because it was terrible.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, good thing.

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Alright, now let's take a look at our last word.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No kidding.

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No kidding.

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No kidding.

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No kidding.

218
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay, so many of you probably already know this word, kidding, right?

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, it means joking.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, I'm joking.

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just kidding.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah.

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, but if I would say no kidding.

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're saying like, yeah, I totally agree with you.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right, I agree with you.

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I know you are.

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I know you're being serious.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I know you're being serious.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I know it's true.

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah.

231
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So I could say, wow, this restaurant is really expensive.

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No kidding.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, so you would agree like, yeah, for real.

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah.

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Alright.

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So this term, no kidding, is slang, right?

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a little bit informal, yeah.

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah.

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Okay.

240
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again for the third time and then we'll come back and talk about Brazil.

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't believe we're here.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Carnival in Rio.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Seriously.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Can you believe it?

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I know.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We're so lucky we found tickets for the samba drum.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Look, it's starting.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Wow, this is amazing.

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Look at how many dancers there are.

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is so cool.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious samba schools in Rio.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No kidding.

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Look at them.

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They're amazing.

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Look at that girl on top of that float.

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
She must be the carnival queen.

261
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay.

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hurry up.

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Take the picture.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, really?

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No, I can't.

267
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Really.

268
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know how to dance.

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Honey, I'll see you later.

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, Marco, so carnival.

272
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a Brazilian celebration, right?

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's very popular in all Latin America.

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, really?

275
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, but Brazilian carnival is very, very special.

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay, so what are they celebrating?

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So basically it's the beginning of Lent, which is this period of time in the Catholic religion right before Easter.

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But carnival in Brazil is very special because of all the dancing and all of this and costumes and everything.

279
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, well, from the dialogue it sounds really wild and crazy.

280
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So what happens?

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, it definitely is really amazing and it's just basically a lot of samba music and partying and it's really nice.

282
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And especially to be able to see something so spectacular is like hundreds and thousands of dancers in the samba drum and they're parading down in their costumes and in floats.

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So it's a very, very special event.

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
All right, so it sounds like a lot of fun.

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to hear from our listeners.

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, for sure.

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We have a lot of listeners from Brazil and carnival is not only celebrated in Rio.

288
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's also in Sao Paulo, in Pernambuco, in Bahia, and it's a little bit different in each place.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So it's not just a thing of Rio.

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's just more popular there.

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is there a samba drum in each city?

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah, there is a samba drum in Sao Paulo.

293
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Oh, cool.

294
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yeah.

295
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Let us know if you've ever been to carnival or how you celebrated in your hometown or in your city.

296
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, come to our website, EnglishPod.com and leave us your comments all about carnival.

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Exactly.

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And everyone be sure to come because we're going to post some videos of what samba is like and some photos so you can get an idea of this really interesting Brazilian celebration.

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay, everyone.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Thanks for listening.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And until next time, goodbye.
