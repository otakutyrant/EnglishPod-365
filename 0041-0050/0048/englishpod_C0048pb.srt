00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,859
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,580
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,320
I'm Erika.

4
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,059
And today we're at a party.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, this is a great, exciting, fun, energetic lesson.

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,160
We're at the biggest party in the world, Carnival in Rio.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,859
Okay so Rio, this is the name of a city, right?

8
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:22,420
Yeah, this is a city in Brazil called Rio de Janeiro.

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,399
So Rio de Janeiro.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,079
Yeah, different pronunciations, right?

11
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,219
It sounds a lot more, I don't know, authentic than mine.

12
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,679
So we sometimes refer to it as Rio just to make it shorter.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,539
Yeah, I think that's actually the most common way it's referred to in English.

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:38,960
Yeah, Rio.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,740
It's just like if you would say Los Angeles, you would say LA.

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,920
Yeah, or if you're talking about Kuala Lumpur, you might say KL.

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,100
Same idea.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,899
Okay, so we have some words that we're going to preview before we listen to our dialogue.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,439
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,359
Vocabulary preview.

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,420
Okay, in vocabulary preview we have one word, sambadrome.

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,619
Sambadrome.

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,640
Sambadrome.

24
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,380
Sambadrome.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,399
This is actually a building.

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,260
So it's a proper noun, not a common noun, right?

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,599
No, it's not really a common noun.

28
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,379
It's a proper noun, but it is a building.

29
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,620
And what happens in this building?

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:18,900
Basically, it's very similar to a stadium, but each end isn't closed off.

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,340
So you have stands on one side and stands on the other, and you have like a little street in the middle.

32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:24,840
Okay.

33
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:31,500
So you can sit down and you can watch people parade or walk by, and you can see the dancers and everything.

34
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,420
And so what is it used for?

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:45,620
The sambadrome is used so that the samba schools can present their dances and their dancers and their costumes to judges and all the people that want to watch them dance samba.

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,420
Okay.

37
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,260
So you've been using this word a lot.

38
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:49,799
Samba.

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,879
What is this?

40
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,500
Samba is a type of dance that Brazil is famous for.

41
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:59,200
It's a very fast dance, a lot of hip movements, a lot of...

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,700
It's very fast, but it's very, very nice.

43
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,659
And the music is based with many different type of tropical instruments.

44
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,219
So it's really, really fun.

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:07,980
Can you samba?

46
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:11,020
I can samba a little bit.

47
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,680
It's kind of hard.

48
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,199
It's trickier than what it seems.

49
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay.

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
Well, we're actually going to hear some samba music in the dialogue, right?

51
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:18,860
Exactly.

52
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:22,120
We're going to hear some samba that is actually used during carnival.

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:22,919
So...

54
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,039
Okay.

55
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,300
So let's go to Rio now and listen to some samba.

56
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,039
I can't believe we're here.

57
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,759
Carnival in Rio.

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,919
Seriously.

59
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,939
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

60
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,360
Can you believe it?

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,159
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

62
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:46,000
I know.

63
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,560
We're so lucky we found tickets for the samba drum.

64
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,520
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,240
Look.

66
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,300
It's starting.

67
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,000
Wow.

68
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,039
This is amazing.

69
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,620
Look at how many dancers there are.

70
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:57,860
Oh my gosh.

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,800
The costumes are so colorful.

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,159
This is so cool.

73
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,680
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious samba schools in Rio.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,539
No kidding.

75
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,599
Look at them.

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,500
They're amazing.

77
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,979
Look at that girl on top of that float.

78
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,520
She must be the carnival queen.

79
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,500
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

80
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:18,340
Okay.

81
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:19,639
Hurry up.

82
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,400
Take the picture.

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,199
Oh really?

84
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:24,439
No.

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,199
I can't.

86
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:25,479
No.

87
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,120
Really.

88
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,319
I don't know how to dance.

89
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,080
Honey, I'll see you later.

90
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,740
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,919
All right.

92
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,860
What a lucky guy.

93
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:50,439
He got asked out to dance by a beautiful Brazilian samba dancer.

94
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,060
I know.

95
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,800
I don't think his wife was very happy though.

96
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:57,379
Well, we've got some language about carnival in Rio, right?

97
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,080
Exactly.

98
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,560
So let's look at that now with language takeaway.

99
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,500
Language takeaway.

100
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:05,479
All right.

101
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,500
Our first word on language takeaway today.

102
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:08,819
Ticket scalper.

103
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:09,840
Ticket scalper.

104
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,020
Ticket scalper.

105
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,419
Ticket scalper.

106
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,099
This is actually a job title, I think.

107
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,300
Maybe not a totally legal job title.

108
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:18,819
Exactly.

109
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,019
So what does a ticket scalper do?

110
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:27,560
Basically, this person will sell tickets at a higher price to people who don't have tickets.

111
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:27,980
Okay.

112
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,600
So he buys like 100 tickets.

113
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:30,939
Right.

114
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:39,220
And goes and stands outside of the samba drum or the- And he sells them for like twice the price, right?

115
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,740
Yeah, exactly.

116
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,019
Yeah, that's a ticket scalper.

117
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,720
Actually, they come in handy sometimes because you want to go to a concert or something and you don't have tickets, you got to turn to them, right?

118
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,279
Right.

119
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay.

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,459
Our next word, prestigious.

121
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:52,500
Prestigious.

122
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:53,759
Prestigious.

123
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:54,480
Prestigious.

124
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:55,319
Prestigious.

125
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,259
Now, this is a very nice word, prestigious.

126
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,579
Before we explain anything, let's listen to some examples.

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,519
Example one.

128
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:09,519
Harvard University is one of the most prestigious schools in North America.

129
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:12,819
Example two.

130
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:20,259
The Academy Award is the most prestigious prize an actor can get in the film industry.

131
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,319
Example three.

132
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:32,300
He worked really hard and now he is a very prestigious heart surgeon.

133
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,899
I can see that when something is prestigious, it's really well respected, right?

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,899
It's well known, well respected.

135
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,100
And you can- And if you are part of this thing, you can feel a sense of pride.

136
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,759
Right.

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,720
Prestige.

138
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,160
Okay, now let's take a look at our last word.

139
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:51,759
Float.

140
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:52,899
Float.

141
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:53,600
Float.

142
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,500
Now, this doesn't mean like to float in water, right?

143
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,199
No, this is a noun, not a verb.

144
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,839
It's kind of hard to describe actually.

145
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,339
Yeah, it is hard to describe.

146
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,420
A float is something that you commonly see in parades.

147
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,399
So it would be like a car, but you can't really see the car.

148
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,459
No, because it's covered with decoration.

149
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,839
With big decorations and it's made to look like an artificial island.

150
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:18,819
Yeah, or a tree maybe.

151
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,639
So you have people standing on there and dancing or waving.

152
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:23,240
Yeah.

153
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:23,959
Okay.

154
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,459
We'll definitely post a picture of a float on our comment section so you can see what a float looks like.

155
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:30,759
Right.

156
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,060
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue again.

157
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,459
We're going to slow it down a little bit so you can understand all of these words we've just talked about.

158
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,360
I know!

159
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,360
We're so lucky that we found tickets for the Sambadrome.

160
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

161
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,160
Look!

162
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,680
It's starting!

163
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:11,899
Wow!

164
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,879
This is amazing!

165
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:16,720
Look at how many dancers there are!

166
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,100
Oh my gosh!

167
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,459
The costumes are so colorful!

168
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,959
This is so cool!

169
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:32,000
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious Samba schools in Rio.

170
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:33,560
No kidding!

171
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,060
Look at them!

172
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,839
They're amazing!

173
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,100
Look at that girl on top of that float!

174
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,860
She must be the Carnival Queen.

175
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,759
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

176
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

177
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,259
Hurry up!

178
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,160
Take the picture!

179
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:51,839
Oh, really?

180
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,980
No, I can't.

181
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,240
No, really, I don't know how to dance.

182
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,060
Honey, I'll see you later!

183
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,259
Don't just leave me here!

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,660
Alright, we're back.

185
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,120
So now I think we should take a look at some of the phrases.

186
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,139
Yeah, let's go to Fluency Builder.

187
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,100
Alright.

188
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,519
Fluency Builder.

189
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,339
So we have this phrase, once in a lifetime.

190
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:24,600
Once in a lifetime.

191
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,000
Once in a lifetime.

192
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,019
Once in a lifetime.

193
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,379
So this is an expression you would use to say that it doesn't happen very often.

194
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, it's a really special event.

195
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,519
So like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

196
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,779
Or a once in a lifetime chance.

197
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,539
Okay.

198
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,320
Once in a lifetime.

199
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,259
Let's look at our next phrase.

200
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,320
Good thing.

201
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:44,740
Good thing.

202
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:45,940
Good thing.

203
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:46,799
Good thing.

204
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,779
So we have some examples for good thing.

205
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,179
Why don't we listen to them and then we'll come back.

206
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,460
It's a good thing that I bought my house before the prices went up.

207
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,600
Good thing I had money in my wallet.

208
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,580
You're happy you had money in your wallet.

209
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,960
You could also maybe use it as a negative, right?

210
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:37,059
Like, good thing I didn't go.

211
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,899
Right, I'm happy I didn't go because it was terrible.

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,299
Okay, good thing.

213
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,039
Alright, now let's take a look at our last word.

214
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:45,960
No kidding.

215
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,820
No kidding.

216
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:47,980
No kidding.

217
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:48,700
No kidding.

218
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,860
Okay, so many of you probably already know this word, kidding, right?

219
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,940
Yeah, it means joking.

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,679
Yeah, I'm joking.

221
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,179
Just kidding.

222
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:55,740
Yeah.

223
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,220
Okay, but if I would say no kidding.

224
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,360
You're saying like, yeah, I totally agree with you.

225
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,779
Right, I agree with you.

226
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:04,679
I know you are.

227
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,139
I know you're being serious.

228
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:07,080
I know you're being serious.

229
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,740
I know it's true.

230
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:08,139
Yeah.

231
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,940
So I could say, wow, this restaurant is really expensive.

232
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:11,620
No kidding.

233
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,659
Yeah, so you would agree like, yeah, for real.

234
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:13,960
Yeah.

235
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,039
Alright.

236
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,259
So this term, no kidding, is slang, right?

237
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:19,779
It's a little bit informal, yeah.

238
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,220
Yeah.

239
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,700
Okay.

240
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,980
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again for the third time and then we'll come back and talk about Brazil.

241
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,179
I can't believe we're here.

242
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,860
Carnival in Rio.

243
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,039
Seriously.

244
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,120
This is like a once in a lifetime opportunity.

245
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:43,600
Can you believe it?

246
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,399
We're here at the biggest party in the world.

247
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,200
I know.

248
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,740
We're so lucky we found tickets for the samba drum.

249
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,720
Good thing we found that ticket scalper.

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,480
Look, it's starting.

251
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,220
Wow, this is amazing.

252
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,799
Look at how many dancers there are.

253
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,980
Oh my gosh, the costumes are so colorful.

254
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,360
This is so cool.

255
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,860
It says here that the school that is dancing now is one of the oldest and most prestigious samba schools in Rio.

256
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:08,740
No kidding.

257
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:09,779
Look at them.

258
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:10,700
They're amazing.

259
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,220
Look at that girl on top of that float.

260
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,659
She must be the carnival queen.

261
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Move over there so I can get a picture of you.

262
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:19,500
Okay.

263
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:20,820
Hurry up.

264
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,539
Take the picture.

265
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,360
Oh, really?

266
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,360
No, I can't.

267
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,220
Really.

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,460
I don't know how to dance.

269
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,259
Honey, I'll see you later.

270
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,919
Patrick, don't just leave me here.

271
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,080
All right, Marco, so carnival.

272
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,899
It's a Brazilian celebration, right?

273
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:52,860
It's very popular in all Latin America.

274
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,299
Oh, really?

275
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,059
Yeah, but Brazilian carnival is very, very special.

276
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,720
Okay, so what are they celebrating?

277
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,919
So basically it's the beginning of Lent, which is this period of time in the Catholic religion right before Easter.

278
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:12,019
But carnival in Brazil is very special because of all the dancing and all of this and costumes and everything.

279
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:15,779
Yeah, well, from the dialogue it sounds really wild and crazy.

280
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:16,940
So what happens?

281
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:24,159
Well, it definitely is really amazing and it's just basically a lot of samba music and partying and it's really nice.

282
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:34,320
And especially to be able to see something so spectacular is like hundreds and thousands of dancers in the samba drum and they're parading down in their costumes and in floats.

283
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,179
So it's a very, very special event.

284
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,419
All right, so it sounds like a lot of fun.

285
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,700
I want to hear from our listeners.

286
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:42,620
Yeah, for sure.

287
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,600
We have a lot of listeners from Brazil and carnival is not only celebrated in Rio.

288
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,059
It's also in Sao Paulo, in Pernambuco, in Bahia, and it's a little bit different in each place.

289
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:54,360
So it's not just a thing of Rio.

290
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,580
It's just more popular there.

291
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,220
Is there a samba drum in each city?

292
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,059
Yeah, there is a samba drum in Sao Paulo.

293
00:12:59,519 --> 00:12:59,860
Oh, cool.

294
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:00,580
Yeah.

295
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,820
Let us know if you've ever been to carnival or how you celebrated in your hometown or in your city.

296
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,700
Yeah, come to our website, EnglishPod.com and leave us your comments all about carnival.

297
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:11,320
Exactly.

298
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:19,919
And everyone be sure to come because we're going to post some videos of what samba is like and some photos so you can get an idea of this really interesting Brazilian celebration.

299
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:20,919
Okay, everyone.

300
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,799
Thanks for listening.

301
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,559
And until next time, goodbye.
