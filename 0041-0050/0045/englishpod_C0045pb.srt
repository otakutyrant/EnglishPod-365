00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:04,620
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,379
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,339
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,859
And today we're bringing you part four of our romantic series called I'm Sorry I Love You.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,580
Yeah, and today we've got some drama, don't we?

7
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,899
We got a lot of drama and we got a lot of useful language.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,960
Yeah, we're going to learn some phrases we can use to describe a mistake.

9
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:27,160
And we're also going to learn how we can comfort someone.

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,600
We can make them feel better.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,260
Okay, exactly.

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,460
So in our dialogue today, Veronica and her boyfriend are on a break.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,799
So what does it mean to be on a break?

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,880
Well, it means you stop having a romantic relationship for a short time.

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,700
So you can say, we are on a break.

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,039
So we're not dating.

17
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:45,759
We're not dating.

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,880
But we don't date.

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,539
Or we could say, let's take a break.

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,020
Right, so we've got the state, on a break, and the action, take a break.

21
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:57,659
Take a break.

22
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:58,880
Okay, let's take a break.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,460
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue and it's going to be a little bit fast.

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,239
And the girl, I think she's crying, so it'll be a little bit difficult to understand.

25
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:10,420
But Marco and I will come back in a minute and we'll talk about some of the difficult language here.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,840
So I said, let's take a break.

27
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,140
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him.

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,819
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

29
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,480
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,019
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,519
You think so?

32
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:43,920
Oh, no.

33
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:45,760
How could he do this to me?

34
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,500
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

35
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,079
Why else wouldn't he call?

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,519
But you two are on a break.

37
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,159
Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,500
He's the love of my life.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,079
I really messed this up.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Come on, hun.

41
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,719
Pull yourself together.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,500
It's going to be all right.

43
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,699
But I still love him and it's all my fault.

44
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,560
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

45
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,520
I mean, he is a firefighter.

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,319
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

47
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:30,460
I've totally messed this up.

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,919
You know what, Veronica?

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,259
I think you should make the first step.

50
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,139
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

51
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:36,800
No.

52
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,800
This is not going to happen.

53
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,120
I've ruined everything.

54
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,860
Hey, do you hear something?

55
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,219
Guess what?

56
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,719
It's your lovely firefighter.

57
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,039
Wow, that's a romantic boyfriend singing in the street.

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,840
Yeah, that's amazing.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,620
Have you ever done that for a girl?

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,500
No.

61
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,439
Have you ever sung to a girl on KTV?

62
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,199
I've sung to a girl on KTV.

63
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,139
And karaoke.

64
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,319
Karaoke, yeah.

65
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,879
But not so much as on the street with all the neighbors coming out to see me.

66
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,520
Wow, okay.

67
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,520
Well, I don't blame you.

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,319
All right, let's take a look at the language that we saw in our dialogue on Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,060
All right, so let's take a look at our first word.

70
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:57,539
Seeing someone.

71
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,580
Seeing someone.

72
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:00,219
Seeing someone.

73
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,039
Seeing someone.

74
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,939
So if I'm seeing someone.

75
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:04,060
You're dating them.

76
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm dating them.

77
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:05,419
Yeah.

78
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,419
I'm frequently going out with that person.

79
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:08,020
Right.

80
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,520
So, but it's not very serious.

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,520
No, it is serious.

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,439
But not really.

83
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,860
It's more of a casual thing.

84
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,160
It's not very exclusive.

85
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,839
So, so if you are seeing someone, then you can also see another person.

86
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:21,740
Maybe.

87
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,800
Hmm.

88
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,079
Well, I think sometimes seeing someone can mean actually they're your boyfriend or girlfriend.

89
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Like, I'm seeing John.

90
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,959
He's my boyfriend.

91
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:31,720
Okay.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,240
Yeah, see, this is the difficult thing about seeing someone is that for some people it means it's really serious, while for other people it means it's more casual.

93
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,959
I guess it's important that you and your boyfriend or girlfriend share the same view on the meaning of this word.

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,720
I have to agree on what seeing someone means.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,180
Okay, well, what's our next word, Marco?

96
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,639
Cheating on.

97
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,360
Cheating on someone.

98
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,839
Cheating on me.

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,259
Cheating on someone.

100
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:58,920
Okay, so if you're cheating on someone.

101
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:06,279
Then you are, like, kissing or even having sex with someone who's not your boyfriend or your husband or your girlfriend or your wife.

102
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:06,620
Absolutely.

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,839
So if I say she cheated on me, that means that my girlfriend kissed or had sex with another guy.

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,920
But if I say she cheated me.

105
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,139
Yeah, that's different.

106
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,019
That's different, right?

107
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,100
Maybe she sold you something for a really high price.

108
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,339
She cheated me.

109
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah.

110
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,519
Or maybe she sold me something that was fake.

111
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,180
Yeah, or broken or something.

112
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:29,920
Okay.

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,480
So cheated on is really different from cheated.

114
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:33,319
Okay.

115
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,819
Let's take a look at our next word.

116
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,480
Messed this up.

117
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:37,939
Messed this up.

118
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,839
Messed this up.

119
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:40,959
Messed this up.

120
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,160
So, Marco, this is a phrasal verb.

121
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,500
And that means we can sort of switch it around a little bit, right?

122
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,079
Exactly.

123
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,379
Why don't we listen to some examples and then we can come back and talk some more.

124
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,040
Example one.

125
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,259
I messed up on the exam and now I won't pass my class.

126
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,079
Example two.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
When I'm cooking, I always mess up and burn the rice.

128
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,399
Okay, so messed up.

129
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,339
It's pretty clear, I think.

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:11,620
Yeah.

131
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,300
All right.

132
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,620
Let's take a look at our next word.

133
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,699
Immature.

134
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:15,600
Immature.

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,779
Immature.

136
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,339
Immature.

137
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,399
So when someone is immature.

138
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,800
They're acting really young.

139
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,839
Really young, right?

140
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,060
But it's not a very good thing to be immature.

141
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,399
No, it has a negative meaning.

142
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:27,040
Right.

143
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,399
It's normal for children to be immature.

144
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,379
Because they're children.

145
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:30,759
Right.

146
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,879
But not an adult.

147
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:32,939
Okay.

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,220
So we've got some examples that will help you to understand this word a little bit better.

149
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,639
Example one.

150
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:42,540
Your toilet jokes are not funny.

151
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,259
Stop being so immature.

152
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
Example two.

153
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,180
Genie acts like she's 16.

154
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,620
She's so immature.

155
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,500
Example three.

156
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,959
God, you and your friends always act so immature.

157
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,339
All right, so immature.

158
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,639
Now let's take a look at our next word.

159
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,459
Selfish.

160
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,240
Selfish.

161
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,560
Selfish.

162
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:10,420
Selfish.

163
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:12,279
So a selfish person.

164
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,879
Is a person who only thinks about themselves.

165
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,720
Okay, so I only think about me.

166
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,899
No one else.

167
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,920
Yeah, you don't care about other people's feelings.

168
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:21,560
Okay.

169
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,939
So it's not a good thing to be immature or selfish.

170
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:25,439
Exactly.

171
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,420
Okay, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

172
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,180
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,579
And this will help you to understand these phrases a little bit more clearly.

174
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,199
So I said, let's take a break.

175
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,879
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call.

176
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,540
But I still haven't heard from him.

177
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,339
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

178
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,779
Come on.

179
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,019
Don't be so dramatic.

180
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,259
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,899
You think so?

182
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,660
Oh, no.

183
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,959
How can he do this to me?

184
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,199
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

185
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,699
Why else wouldn't he call?

186
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,160
But you two are on a break, theoretically.

187
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:21,300
He can do whatever he likes.

188
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,220
He's the love of my life.

189
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,800
I've really messed this up.

190
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,139
Come on, hun.

191
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,299
Pull yourself together.

192
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,600
It's going to be all right.

193
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:38,279
But I, I still love him.

194
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,419
And it's all my fault.

195
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,220
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

196
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:49,899
I mean, he is a firefighter.

197
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:57,559
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

198
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,820
I've totally messed this up.

199
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,799
You know what, Veronica?

200
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,460
I think you should make the first step.

201
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

202
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,059
No.

203
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,460
This is not going to happen.

204
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,159
I, I've ruined everything.

205
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,170
Hey, do you hear something?

206
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,970
Guess what?

207
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,529
It's your lovely firefighter.

208
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,629
Okay, so we saw Veronica's friend trying to calm her down.

209
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,149
Yeah, trying to comfort her.

210
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:40,590
Okay, to make her feel better.

211
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,490
Let's take a look at some of the phrases she used in Fluency Builder.

212
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,750
Fluency Builder.

213
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:50,350
Okay, so what was the first phrase that she said?

214
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,909
Everything is going to work out just fine.

215
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,690
Everything is going to work out just fine.

216
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,870
Everything is going to work out just fine.

217
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:58,850
What does that mean?

218
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,090
It's going to be okay.

219
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,129
It's going to be okay, right?

220
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,870
Yeah, the problem will be solved.

221
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,769
Okay, so if somebody's worried or somebody is crying, you can say, don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine.

222
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,909
Okay, okay, let's look at the next one.

223
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,529
Pull yourself together.

224
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:17,009
Pull yourself together.

225
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,710
Pull yourself together.

226
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,730
Pull yourself together.

227
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:21,370
So what does that mean exactly?

228
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,269
That sounds kind of weird.

229
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,629
I know, I guess it just means stop crying, relax, and take a deep breath.

230
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,029
Okay, just like calm down.

231
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,730
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:33,269
Get organized with your ideas and your thoughts.

233
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:39,570
Yeah, so you can think of maybe somebody who's got tears down their face and everything is sort of in a mess.

234
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,629
If you pull it together, they clean up and they sort of relax, right?

235
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:45,629
Okay, pull yourself together.

236
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,850
All right, and the last phrase that we saw, it's going to be all right.

237
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,370
It's going to be all right.

238
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,289
It's going to be all right.

239
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,370
It's going to be all right.

240
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,070
So it's going to be all right means everything is going to be okay.

241
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,149
Yeah, it's going to be fine.

242
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,090
It's going to be fine.

243
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,269
The problem will go away.

244
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,629
You'll feel better.

245
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,929
Maybe you could even say, it'll be all right.

246
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:08,789
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:09,730
It'll be all right.

248
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:18,250
Yeah, these are three really helpful phrases that you can use when you want to say something nice to a friend or a colleague who has a problem.

249
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,669
Okay, exactly.

250
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,570
Very useful language.

251
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,529
So let's listen to some more examples.

252
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,389
Example one.

253
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,070
Don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine.

254
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,909
I'm sure he still loves you.

255
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,210
Example two.

256
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,929
Everything is going to be all right.

257
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:43,190
We'll find your puppy.

258
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,029
Don't worry.

259
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,269
Okay, great examples, and I think it's clear now.

260
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,470
So let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

261
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:02,230
So I said, let's take a break.

262
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,570
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him.

263
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,309
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

264
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,970
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

265
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,490
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

266
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:18,970
You think so?

267
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,409
Oh, no.

268
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,230
How could he do this to me?

269
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,970
Okay, I'm sure he's cheating on me.

270
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,590
Why else wouldn't he call?

271
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,990
But you two are on a break.

272
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,649
Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

273
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,909
He's the love of my life.

274
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,490
I really messed this up.

275
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,210
Come on, hun, pull yourself together.

276
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,970
It's going to be all right.

277
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,169
But I still love him, and it's all my fault.

278
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,009
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

279
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,990
I mean, he is a firefighter.

280
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:03,769
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

281
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,909
I totally messed this up.

282
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:08,450
You know what, Veronica?

283
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,769
I think you should make the first step.

284
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:12,610
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

285
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,269
No, this is not going to happen.

286
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,590
I've ruined everything.

287
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,789
Hey, do you hear something?

288
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,669
Guess what?

289
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,190
It's your lovely firefighter.

290
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,190
Okay, I really like this dialogue.

291
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,049
It's so romantic.

292
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,509
It's drama, but at the same time romantic.

293
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,789
So we want to know what you think will happen next.

294
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,789
Yeah, will they get back together?

295
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,909
Will they get married?

296
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:07,929
Will they have a baby?

297
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,490
Maybe they'll break up forever.

298
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,470
Maybe she'll move halfway across the world.

299
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:16,490
Anything could happen, so let us know what you think will happen.

300
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,490
Come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave your comments on the lesson page.

301
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,370
Exactly, and maybe you'll be right.

302
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:24,409
Yeah, you never know.

303
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,789
Okay, so we're out of time for today.

304
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,169
I hope you guys had fun, and we'll see you next time.

305
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,490
Until then, it's goodbye.
