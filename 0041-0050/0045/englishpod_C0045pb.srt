00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're bringing you part four of our romantic series called I'm Sorry I Love You.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeah, and today we've got some drama, don't we?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We got a lot of drama and we got a lot of useful language.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, we're going to learn some phrases we can use to describe a mistake.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And we're also going to learn how we can comfort someone.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We can make them feel better.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, exactly.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So in our dialogue today, Veronica and her boyfriend are on a break.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So what does it mean to be on a break?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, it means you stop having a romantic relationship for a short time.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So you can say, we are on a break.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we're not dating.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're not dating.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But we don't date.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Or we could say, let's take a break.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Right, so we've got the state, on a break, and the action, take a break.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Take a break.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, let's take a break.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue and it's going to be a little bit fast.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And the girl, I think she's crying, so it'll be a little bit difficult to understand.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But Marco and I will come back in a minute and we'll talk about some of the difficult language here.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So I said, let's take a break.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You think so?

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, no.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How could he do this to me?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why else wouldn't he call?

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But you two are on a break.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He's the love of my life.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I really messed this up.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on, hun.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Pull yourself together.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's going to be all right.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I still love him and it's all my fault.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I mean, he is a firefighter.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've totally messed this up.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know what, Veronica?

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think you should make the first step.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is not going to happen.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I've ruined everything.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, do you hear something?

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Guess what?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's your lovely firefighter.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wow, that's a romantic boyfriend singing in the street.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, that's amazing.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Have you ever done that for a girl?

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Have you ever sung to a girl on KTV?

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've sung to a girl on KTV.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And karaoke.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Karaoke, yeah.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But not so much as on the street with all the neighbors coming out to see me.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wow, okay.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, I don't blame you.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
All right, let's take a look at the language that we saw in our dialogue on Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right, so let's take a look at our first word.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Seeing someone.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Seeing someone.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Seeing someone.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Seeing someone.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So if I'm seeing someone.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're dating them.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm dating them.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm frequently going out with that person.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So, but it's not very serious.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, it is serious.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But not really.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's more of a casual thing.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not very exclusive.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So, so if you are seeing someone, then you can also see another person.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Maybe.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hmm.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, I think sometimes seeing someone can mean actually they're your boyfriend or girlfriend.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Like, I'm seeing John.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He's my boyfriend.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yeah, see, this is the difficult thing about seeing someone is that for some people it means it's really serious, while for other people it means it's more casual.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I guess it's important that you and your boyfriend or girlfriend share the same view on the meaning of this word.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have to agree on what seeing someone means.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay, well, what's our next word, Marco?

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cheating on.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Cheating on someone.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Cheating on me.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Cheating on someone.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, so if you're cheating on someone.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Then you are, like, kissing or even having sex with someone who's not your boyfriend or your husband or your girlfriend or your wife.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Absolutely.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So if I say she cheated on me, that means that my girlfriend kissed or had sex with another guy.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But if I say she cheated me.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, that's different.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's different, right?

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Maybe she sold you something for a really high price.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
She cheated me.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or maybe she sold me something that was fake.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, or broken or something.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So cheated on is really different from cheated.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's take a look at our next word.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Messed this up.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Messed this up.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Messed this up.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Messed this up.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So, Marco, this is a phrasal verb.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And that means we can sort of switch it around a little bit, right?

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Exactly.

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why don't we listen to some examples and then we can come back and talk some more.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Example one.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I messed up on the exam and now I won't pass my class.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Example two.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
When I'm cooking, I always mess up and burn the rice.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, so messed up.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's pretty clear, I think.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah.

131
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All right.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's take a look at our next word.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Immature.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Immature.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Immature.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Immature.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So when someone is immature.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They're acting really young.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Really young, right?

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But it's not a very good thing to be immature.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, it has a negative meaning.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Right.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's normal for children to be immature.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because they're children.

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Right.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But not an adult.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So we've got some examples that will help you to understand this word a little bit better.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Example one.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Your toilet jokes are not funny.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stop being so immature.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Example two.

153
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Genie acts like she's 16.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She's so immature.

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Example three.

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
God, you and your friends always act so immature.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
All right, so immature.

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now let's take a look at our next word.

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Selfish.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Selfish.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Selfish.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Selfish.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So a selfish person.

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is a person who only thinks about themselves.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, so I only think about me.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No one else.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, you don't care about other people's feelings.

168
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So it's not a good thing to be immature or selfish.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Exactly.

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, so I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue again.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And this will help you to understand these phrases a little bit more clearly.

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So I said, let's take a break.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call.

176
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But I still haven't heard from him.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Come on.

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't be so dramatic.

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You think so?

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, no.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How can he do this to me?

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sure he's cheating on me.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why else wouldn't he call?

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But you two are on a break, theoretically.

187
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He can do whatever he likes.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's the love of my life.

189
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I've really messed this up.

190
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come on, hun.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Pull yourself together.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's going to be all right.

193
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But I, I still love him.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And it's all my fault.

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I mean, he is a firefighter.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've totally messed this up.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You know what, Veronica?

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I think you should make the first step.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is not going to happen.

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I, I've ruined everything.

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, do you hear something?

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Guess what?

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's your lovely firefighter.

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay, so we saw Veronica's friend trying to calm her down.

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, trying to comfort her.

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay, to make her feel better.

211
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Let's take a look at some of the phrases she used in Fluency Builder.

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Fluency Builder.

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, so what was the first phrase that she said?

214
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Everything is going to work out just fine.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Everything is going to work out just fine.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Everything is going to work out just fine.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What does that mean?

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's going to be okay.

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's going to be okay, right?

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, the problem will be solved.

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, so if somebody's worried or somebody is crying, you can say, don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine.

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, okay, let's look at the next one.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Pull yourself together.

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Pull yourself together.

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Pull yourself together.

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Pull yourself together.

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So what does that mean exactly?

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That sounds kind of weird.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I know, I guess it just means stop crying, relax, and take a deep breath.

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay, just like calm down.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Get organized with your ideas and your thoughts.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, so you can think of maybe somebody who's got tears down their face and everything is sort of in a mess.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If you pull it together, they clean up and they sort of relax, right?

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay, pull yourself together.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right, and the last phrase that we saw, it's going to be all right.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's going to be all right.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's going to be all right.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's going to be all right.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So it's going to be all right means everything is going to be okay.

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, it's going to be fine.

242
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's going to be fine.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The problem will go away.

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You'll feel better.

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Maybe you could even say, it'll be all right.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It'll be all right.

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, these are three really helpful phrases that you can use when you want to say something nice to a friend or a colleague who has a problem.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay, exactly.

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Very useful language.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So let's listen to some more examples.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Example one.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't worry, everything is going to work out just fine.

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sure he still loves you.

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Example two.

256
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Everything is going to be all right.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We'll find your puppy.

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't worry.

259
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, great examples, and I think it's clear now.

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and talk some more.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So I said, let's take a break.

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And since that night, I've been waiting for him to call, but I still haven't heard from him.

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Come on, don't be so dramatic.

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.

266
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You think so?

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, no.

268
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How could he do this to me?

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay, I'm sure he's cheating on me.

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why else wouldn't he call?

271
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But you two are on a break.

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's the love of my life.

274
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I really messed this up.

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Come on, hun, pull yourself together.

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's going to be all right.

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But I still love him, and it's all my fault.

278
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being.

279
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I mean, he is a firefighter.

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I totally messed this up.

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know what, Veronica?

283
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I think you should make the first step.

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm sure he'll forgive you.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No, this is not going to happen.

286
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I've ruined everything.

287
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hey, do you hear something?

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Guess what?

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's your lovely firefighter.

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay, I really like this dialogue.

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's so romantic.

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's drama, but at the same time romantic.

293
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So we want to know what you think will happen next.

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah, will they get back together?

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Will they get married?

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Will they have a baby?

297
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Maybe they'll break up forever.

298
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Maybe she'll move halfway across the world.

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Anything could happen, so let us know what you think will happen.

300
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Come to our website at EnglishPod.com and leave your comments on the lesson page.

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Exactly, and maybe you'll be right.

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, you never know.

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, so we're out of time for today.

304
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I hope you guys had fun, and we'll see you next time.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Until then, it's goodbye.
