00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're going to be talking about a really common situation with parents.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, when you're a teenager you always need to ask your parents for money, ask your parents for the car, or ask your parents if you can do something.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Exactly, and that's what we're going to be looking at is how you can ask for permission for the car, for money.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right, and these phrases are not only for your parents, right?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, you could use them in your office, with your boss, or for any situation where you need to ask politely.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, so let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We have one word for you today.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Concerts.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Concerts.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Concerts.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A concert.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A concert is an event, right?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Where people play music.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Right.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So you have different types of concerts, like a rock concert.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They play rock music.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Or a pop concert.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, a pop music.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Or even a classical music concert.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Exactly where you have people playing violins and pianos.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, concert.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So concerts are always for music.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They're always for music.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, with that, let's go into our dialogue.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Marco, what happens here?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, basically we have a teenage girl who needs to go to a concert and is asking her dad for something.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alright, let's listen.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But last week, Smelly Toes is playing and Eric asked if I would go with him.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Who is this Eric guy?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Duh.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on, dad.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No can do.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sorry.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Fine then.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No way.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ugh, that's so unfair.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Teenagers, huh?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
They're always asking for something.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah, this brings back memories, but I'll tell you about that later.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why don't we take a look at the vocabulary in Language Takeaway?

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, we've got a few interesting words here.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The first one, hottest.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hottest.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hottest.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So this is the superlative of hot.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right, so the hottest guy in school is...

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The most handsome...

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, the most sexy guy in school.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Exactly.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So if somebody is hot, they are really attractive.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Really good looking.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Really good looking.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So Marco, is this a word that is only used for men?

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, you can also use it for women.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And what about things?

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You know, recently with Paris Hilton, it's more popular with things like, wow, I got a new car.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wow, that's hot.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But I guess we maybe should tell our listeners to be careful with this word.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, you don't really want to tell somebody, you're hot.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not very polite.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But with your friends, you can use this word.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I'm talking with my friends and I see a girl like, wow, she's hot, okay.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But just don't tell her.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, don't go up to her and say, wow, you're hot.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Our next word, most popular.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Most popular.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Most popular.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Most popular.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Another superlative.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Exactly.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And popular means...

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Means having a lot of friends.

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Exactly.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Having a lot of friends or being well-known.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Or well-liked.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well-liked.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yep.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So in every school, there's always like the most popular guy in school, the most popular girl.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yep.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Were you the most popular guy?

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Not really.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, I wasn't the most popular guy, but I wasn't unpopular.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So that's the opposite.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So I was okay.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All right.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Our last phrase.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Fine then.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Fine then.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Fine then.

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Fine then.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well, this is a phrase made up of two simple words, but why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand the meaning of these two words together.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Example one.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Fine then.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you won't go with me, I'll go by myself.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Example two.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Fine then.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you want to break up, I don't care.

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Example three.

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You want to go out with your friends?

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fine then.

116
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Go!

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So you would use this when you agree with somebody, but you're not really happy about it.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's like saying, I agree, but I'm really angry.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Right.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Maybe sometimes because you don't have a choice.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yeah.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Right?

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Like the girl.

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Fine then.

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So even though we have the word fine in there, it's not really a nice thing to say to someone.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, this is definitely not one to use with your boss.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Right.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Exactly.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay.

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll talk about some more phrases.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey, Daddy.

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You look great today.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I like your tie.

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
By the way, I was wondering, can I...

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you want?

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you think I could borrow the car?

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm going to a concert tonight.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hmm.

149
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't think so.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ugh.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I told you about it last week.

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Smelly Toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Who is this Eric guy?

155
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Duh.

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come on, Dad, please.

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No can do.

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Sorry.

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Fine, then.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No way.

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's so unfair.

164
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There's a lot of phrases in this dialogue that we can use to ask for something, right?

165
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Exactly, and in a very polite way.

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay.

167
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We're going to look at three ways of asking for something.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The first way is, I was wondering.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I was wondering.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I was wondering.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I could say, I was wondering, can I borrow your car?

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Or, I was wondering, can I stay at your house?

174
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay.

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a very nice way to ask something.

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah.

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like to begin a question.

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To begin, yeah.

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
All right.

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's take a look at the next one, and it's basically the same thing.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Do you think I could...

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you think I could...

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you think I could...

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Do you think I could...

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Borrow the car?

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Right?

189
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Or, do you think I could use your computer?

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can say, I was wondering, can I use your computer?

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you think I could use your computer?

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They mean the same.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Right.

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Now, let's look at the last one.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Would you mind...

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Would you mind...

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Would you mind...

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Would you mind...

200
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So I could say, would you mind holding this for me?

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yep.

202
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Or, would you mind finishing this report for me?

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now, there's an interesting thing here, that you have the verb in a gerund form, right?

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right.

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The I-N-G form.

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Exactly.

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Giving, holding, finishing.

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So, we've got, I was wondering, can I do something?

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right.

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And, would you mind doing something?

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So you have the I-N-G.

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Mm-hmm.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Be very, very careful.

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Be sure to not say, would you mind to give me?

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right.

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's wrong.

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Right.

219
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's wrong.

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

221
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

222
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So you would say, would you mind giving me?

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's listen to some more examples of these three phrases.

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Example one.

226
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Would you mind cooking dinner tonight?

227
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll be home late.

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Example two.

229
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We were wondering if you could buy the tickets for us?

230
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Example three.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do you think you can have those reports finished by today?

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Alright, so I think it's really clear now, and it's a very useful way of asking for things.

233
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue for the third time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey, Daddy.

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You look great today.

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I like your tie.

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
By the way, I was wondering, can I...

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No.

239
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, okay.

241
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What do you want?

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Do you think I could borrow the car?

243
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going to a concert tonight.

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Um, I don't think so.

245
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ugh.

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I told you about it last week.

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Smelly Toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him.

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Who is this Eric guy?

250
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Duh.

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Come on, Dad.

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please?

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No can do.

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sorry.

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Fine then.

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

258
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No way.

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ugh.

260
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's so unfair.

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So Marco, you said that this dialogue really brought back some memories for you.

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah, my dad was exactly the same way.

263
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I would just say, Dad, and he would be like, no.

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So he would always cut me off before I ask anything.

265
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sounds like a pretty strict guy.

266
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No, but it was a lot of fun.

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sometimes he would just say it just to make me angry or something like that.

268
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Like just as a joke.

269
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But it was difficult to get him to lend me the car, for example.

271
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Really?

272
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh yeah, I mean he wouldn't just lend me the car.

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And sometimes if he did lend me the car, then the next day he would be like, hey, you need to wash the car or something like that.

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, so you had to pay him back.

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I had to pay him back with something.

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
In my family, I was always allowed to borrow the car because we lived really, really far away from the city, so there were no buses or subway.

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I always got to borrow the worst car, you know, the most terrible car.

278
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh really?

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Which led to so many problems, like my car stopping working in the middle of the street, which was never good.

280
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We did used to live a little bit further away from downtown, but we had a good bus system.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So it would just be like, take the bus, it's cheaper, stuff like that.

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So I didn't really get the car that often until I bought my own or until I had a motorcycle of my own, and then problem solved.

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
All right, well, I want to know from our listeners, what did they ask for from their parents?

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Exactly, did you ask for the car, did you ask for money?

285
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Or did you ask for a pony?

286
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Did you ask for a pony?

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I had a friend who had a summer home.

288
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Really?

289
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So he would ask for the keys to the summer home.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay, well, come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Exactly, leave your questions and comments, we want to hear from you, we want to know what you think, and Erika and I are definitely there to answer any doubts.

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
