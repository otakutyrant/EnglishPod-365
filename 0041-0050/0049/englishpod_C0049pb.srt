00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,859
And today we're going to be talking about a really common situation with parents.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:17,420
Yeah, when you're a teenager you always need to ask your parents for money, ask your parents for the car, or ask your parents if you can do something.

6
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,820
Exactly, and that's what we're going to be looking at is how you can ask for permission for the car, for money.

7
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:26,780
Right, and these phrases are not only for your parents, right?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,259
No, you could use them in your office, with your boss, or for any situation where you need to ask politely.

9
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,299
Okay, so let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,579
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,500
We have one word for you today.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,280
Concerts.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,479
Concerts.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,560
Concerts.

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,619
A concert.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,439
A concert is an event, right?

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:51,960
Yeah.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,500
Where people play music.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,299
Right.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,560
So you have different types of concerts, like a rock concert.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,579
They play rock music.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,939
Or a pop concert.

23
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:02,100
Yeah, a pop music.

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,540
Or even a classical music concert.

25
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,680
Exactly where you have people playing violins and pianos.

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,379
Okay, concert.

27
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,359
So concerts are always for music.

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,040
Yeah, exactly.

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:12,980
They're always for music.

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,319
Well, with that, let's go into our dialogue.

31
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,040
Marco, what happens here?

32
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:24,760
Well, basically we have a teenage girl who needs to go to a concert and is asking her dad for something.

33
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,799
Alright, let's listen.

34
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,120
But last week, Smelly Toes is playing and Eric asked if I would go with him.

35
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,599
Who is this Eric guy?

36
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,340
Duh.

37
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,200
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

38
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,040
Come on, dad.

39
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:04,620
Please?

40
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:05,980
No can do.

41
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,340
Sorry.

42
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:07,560
Fine then.

43
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,699
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,039
No way.

45
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,219
Ugh, that's so unfair.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,219
Teenagers, huh?

47
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:18,840
Yeah.

48
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,680
They're always asking for something.

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,039
Yeah, this brings back memories, but I'll tell you about that later.

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,520
Why don't we take a look at the vocabulary in Language Takeaway?

51
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,259
Alright, we've got a few interesting words here.

52
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,539
The first one, hottest.

53
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:38,979
Hottest.

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:39,860
Hottest.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,879
So this is the superlative of hot.

56
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,000
Right, so the hottest guy in school is...

57
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,000
The most handsome...

58
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,180
Yeah, the most sexy guy in school.

59
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,580
Exactly.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,120
So if somebody is hot, they are really attractive.

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,039
Really good looking.

62
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:55,979
Really good looking.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,860
So Marco, is this a word that is only used for men?

64
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,139
No, you can also use it for women.

65
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:04,879
And what about things?

66
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:11,659
You know, recently with Paris Hilton, it's more popular with things like, wow, I got a new car.

67
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,560
Wow, that's hot.

68
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,080
But I guess we maybe should tell our listeners to be careful with this word.

69
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,020
Yeah, you don't really want to tell somebody, you're hot.

70
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:21,819
No.

71
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,300
It's not very polite.

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,740
But with your friends, you can use this word.

73
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,120
Exactly.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,599
If I'm talking with my friends and I see a girl like, wow, she's hot, okay.

75
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,840
But just don't tell her.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,879
Yeah, don't go up to her and say, wow, you're hot.

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,379
Okay.

78
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,319
Our next word, most popular.

79
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,860
Most popular.

80
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,860
Most popular.

81
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,620
Most popular.

82
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:40,819
Another superlative.

83
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:42,219
Exactly.

84
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,780
And popular means...

85
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,960
Means having a lot of friends.

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,719
Exactly.

87
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,680
Having a lot of friends or being well-known.

88
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,680
Or well-liked.

89
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,400
Well-liked.

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:51,680
Yep.

91
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:57,080
So in every school, there's always like the most popular guy in school, the most popular girl.

92
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:57,460
Yep.

93
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,860
Were you the most popular guy?

94
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,699
Not really.

95
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,120
No, I wasn't the most popular guy, but I wasn't unpopular.

96
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:05,780
Okay.

97
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,840
So that's the opposite.

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,259
Yeah.

99
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,659
So I was okay.

100
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:09,319
All right.

101
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,560
Our last phrase.

102
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:11,599
Fine then.

103
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,439
Fine then.

104
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,500
Fine then.

105
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,519
Fine then.

106
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:25,019
Well, this is a phrase made up of two simple words, but why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand the meaning of these two words together.

107
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:27,819
Example one.

108
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,699
Fine then.

109
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,680
If you won't go with me, I'll go by myself.

110
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:41,959
Example two.

111
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,240
Fine then.

112
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,160
If you want to break up, I don't care.

113
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,319
Example three.

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,680
You want to go out with your friends?

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,879
Fine then.

116
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,259
Go!

117
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,000
So you would use this when you agree with somebody, but you're not really happy about it.

118
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,379
It's like saying, I agree, but I'm really angry.

119
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:14,920
Right.

120
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,819
Maybe sometimes because you don't have a choice.

121
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,199
Yeah.

122
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:17,519
Right?

123
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,040
Like the girl.

124
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,740
Fine then.

125
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,519
Yeah.

126
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:19,939
Yeah.

127
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,060
So even though we have the word fine in there, it's not really a nice thing to say to someone.

128
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,620
No.

129
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,779
No, this is definitely not one to use with your boss.

130
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:29,459
Right.

131
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:29,980
Yeah.

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,399
Exactly.

133
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,019
Okay.

134
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:31,779
Okay.

135
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:31,860
Okay.

136
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:35,779
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll talk about some more phrases.

137
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,839
Hey, Daddy.

138
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,759
You look great today.

139
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,500
I like your tie.

140
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,639
By the way, I was wondering, can I...

141
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:49,680
No.

142
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,639
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,579
Okay.

144
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay.

145
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,819
What do you want?

146
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,860
Do you think I could borrow the car?

147
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm going to a concert tonight.

148
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,620
Hmm.

149
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,740
I don't think so.

150
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:07,160
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

151
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,180
Ugh.

152
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,399
I told you about it last week.

153
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:17,279
Smelly Toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him.

154
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,600
Who is this Eric guy?

155
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,839
Duh.

156
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:24,939
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,699
Come on, Dad, please.

158
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,019
No can do.

159
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:30,779
Sorry.

160
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:32,339
Fine, then.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,420
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

162
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,160
No way.

163
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,379
That's so unfair.

164
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,459
There's a lot of phrases in this dialogue that we can use to ask for something, right?

165
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,860
Exactly, and in a very polite way.

166
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,420
Okay.

167
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,720
We're going to look at three ways of asking for something.

168
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,720
The first way is, I was wondering.

169
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,399
I was wondering.

170
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,680
I was wondering.

171
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,540
I could say, I was wondering, can I borrow your car?

172
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah.

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,680
Or, I was wondering, can I stay at your house?

174
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:11,879
Okay.

175
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,120
It's a very nice way to ask something.

176
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:14,420
Yeah.

177
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,040
It's like to begin a question.

178
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,920
To begin, yeah.

179
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:17,420
Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,759
All right.

181
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,560
Let's take a look at the next one, and it's basically the same thing.

182
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,339
Do you think I could?

183
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,660
Do you think I could?

184
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
Do you think I could?

185
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,939
Do you think I could?

186
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,040
Borrow the car?

187
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:28,959
Right?

188
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,819
Or, do you think I could use your computer?

189
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,480
I can say, I was wondering, can I use your computer?

190
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,459
Do you think I could use your computer?

191
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:36,879
Yeah.

192
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,660
They mean the same.

193
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:38,220
Right.

194
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,339
Now, let's look at the last one.

195
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,920
Would you mind?

196
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,139
Would you mind?

197
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Would you mind?

198
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,779
Would you mind?

199
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:50,439
So I could say, would you mind holding this for me?

200
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,399
Or, would you mind finishing this report for me?

201
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,639
Now, there's an interesting thing here, that you have the verb in a gerund form, right?

202
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,040
Right.

203
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,540
The I-N-G form.

204
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:03,259
Exactly.

205
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,800
Giving, holding, finishing.

206
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,279
So, we've got, I was wondering, can I do something?

207
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:09,800
Right.

208
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,800
And, would you mind doing something?

209
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,240
Yeah.

210
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,180
So, you have the I-N-G.

211
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:16,639
Be very, very careful.

212
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,180
Be sure to not say, would you mind to give me?

213
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,120
Right, that's wrong.

214
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:21,899
Right, that's wrong.

215
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,439
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

216
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:23,040
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

217
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,420
So, you would say, would you mind giving me?

218
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:25,740
Yep.

219
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,500
Okay.

220
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,819
Let's listen to some more examples of these three phrases.

221
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,879
Example one.

222
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,419
Would you mind cooking dinner tonight?

223
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,519
I'll be home late.

224
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:41,340
Example two.

225
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,360
We were wondering if you could buy the tickets for us?

226
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:50,340
Example three.

227
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,559
Do you think you can have those reports finished by today?

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,539
Alright, so I think it's really clear now, and it's a very useful way of asking for things.

229
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,320
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue for the third time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

230
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,840
Hey, Daddy.

231
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,519
You look great today.

232
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,759
I like your tie.

233
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:17,340
By the way, I was wondering, can I?

234
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:17,740
No.

235
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,399
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

236
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,720
Okay, okay.

237
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,440
What do you want?

238
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,879
Do you think I could borrow the car?

239
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:27,019
I'm going to a concert tonight.

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,460
Um, I don't think so.

241
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,440
I need the car tonight to pick up your mother.

242
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,120
Ugh, I told you about it last week.

243
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,639
Smelly Toes is playing, and Eric asked if I would go with him.

244
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,159
Who is this Eric guy?

245
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:39,840
Duh.

246
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,779
He's like the hottest and most popular guy at school.

247
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,600
Come on, Dad.

248
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,179
Please?

249
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:45,559
No can do.

250
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:45,919
Sorry.

251
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:47,100
Fine then.

252
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,240
Would you mind giving me 100 bucks?

253
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,600
No way.

254
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,740
Ugh, that's so unfair.

255
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,360
So Marco, you said that this dialogue really brought back some memories for you.

256
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,759
Yeah, my dad was exactly the same way.

257
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,100
I would just say, Dad, and he would be like, no.

258
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,379
Wow.

259
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,879
So he would always cut me off before I ask anything.

260
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,120
Sounds like a pretty strict guy.

261
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,379
No, but it was a lot of fun.

262
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,519
Sometimes he would just say it just to make me angry or something like that.

263
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,559
Like, just as a joke.

264
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,700
Yeah, exactly.

265
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,559
But it was difficult to get him to lend me the car, for example.

266
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:23,980
Really?

267
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,200
Oh yeah, I mean, he wouldn't just lend me the car.

268
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,779
And sometimes if he did lend me the car, then the next day he would be like, hey, you need to wash the car, or something like that.

269
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,440
So you had to pay him back.

270
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,080
I had to pay him back with something.

271
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:44,279
In my family, I was always allowed to borrow the car because we lived really, really far away from the city, so there were no buses or subway.

272
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:49,740
But I always got to borrow the worst car, you know, the most terrible car.

273
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,179
Oh, really?

274
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:57,059
Yeah, which led to so many problems, like my car stopping working in the middle of the street, which was never good.

275
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,340
We did used to live a little bit further away from downtown, but we had a good bus system.

276
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,200
So we'd just be like, take the bus, it's cheaper, and stuff like that.

277
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,879
So I didn't really get the car that often until I bought my own or until I had a motorcycle of my own, and then problem solved.

278
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:18,279
All right, well, I want to know from our listeners, what did they ask for from their parents?

279
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,200
Exactly, did you ask for the car, did you ask for money?

280
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,460
Or did you ask for a pony?

281
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,799
Did you ask for a pony?

282
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,720
I had a friend who had a summer home.

283
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,220
Really?

284
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,539
So he would ask for the keys to the summer home.

285
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,539
Okay, well, come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

286
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,759
Exactly, leave your questions and comments.

287

We want to hear from you.

288
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,139
We want to know what you think.
