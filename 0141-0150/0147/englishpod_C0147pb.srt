00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,879
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:07,580
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,339
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,619
And today, Marco, you and I are talking about movies, right?

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:17,100
We're talking a little bit about movies, but mostly we're having a big argument.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,980
OK, I kind of like arguments.

7
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:22,019
Lots of great words and phrases for you to learn here in English.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,620
But we've got an upper intermediate level lesson with some people who are not getting along very well.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,020
It's a couple, a guy and a girl, and they're having a fight, as couples do.

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,979
So we're going to be learning a lot of the different language that they are using in this very heated debate.

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,460
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time, and then we'll be right back.

12
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:51,259
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,060
Next time, I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

14
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, you should have picked.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,060
But in the end, you always complain about everything.

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,520
Not everything, just this film.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,560
Even the title is ridiculous.

18
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,340
And it's so long.

19
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,920
Those were the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

20
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:12,879
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,439
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

22
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,700
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

23
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:24,879
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

24
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:25,719
You see?

25
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,180
That's what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,819
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

27
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,379
Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,459
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

29
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,480
At least he appreciates love stories.

30
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:38,840
Love stories?

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,799
More like one-night stands.

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,459
Don't criticize Mario, or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours.

33
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,439
They're no saints.

34
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,439
My friends?

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,079
Fat?

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,620
What about those whales you call friends?

37
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:51,939
You're unbearable.

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,019
You can walk home.

39
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:53,480
I'm leaving.

40
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
Fine.

41
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:32,120
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we have four words, and the first one that you probably saw in the very first sentence is a chick flick.

42
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,460
Chick flick.

43
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:38,300
So, first of all, the word chick means a woman, it's slang, and it's not very nice.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,159
It's not very nice.

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:39,419
No.

46
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,819
Well, I mean, between guys, you would use it as like, oh, this chick or that chick, but you wouldn't really walk up to a girl and call her a chick, right?

47
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,340
No, you wouldn't say, hey, chick, what's up?

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,199
Not something you want to say.

49
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,780
Okay, so chick is a slang word for a girl or a woman, and a chick flick is a girl's movie.

50
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,500
So a flick is a movie.

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:58,879
Yeah.

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,780
Another slang word.

53
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:00,759
Exactly.

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,860
So this is the slang phrase for flick, so, hey, Marco, what flicks are showing at the movie theater?

55
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,879
All right.

56
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:07,199
Yeah.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,180
So, movies.

58
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,819
So, and a chick flick is usually a romantic movie, a drama, something that's very...

59
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,740
Like Beaches.

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,039
Beaches is a chick flick.

61
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,199
I don't know if you've ever seen that.

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,139
I've never seen it.

63
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:22,939
So He's Just Not That Into You is one of those new chick flicks.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,900
Or like How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

65
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,719
Yeah, How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days or The Devil Wears Prada.

66
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,479
Bride Wars.

67
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,259
Bride Wars.

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,280
Wow, lots of chick flicks.

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,300
I've actually never seen any one of these, except How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

70
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,500
I've actually only seen that one.

71
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,400
All right.

72
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,460
So, chick flick is a girl's or woman's movie.

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,340
And next up, we have a word, sarcastic.

74
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,680
We're talking about sarcastic jokes.

75
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,080
So, sarcastic jokes or somebody being sarcastic.

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,860
God, Marco, you're always so sarcastic.

77
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,800
So what would sarcasm sound like?

78
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,560
Yeah, he's really funny.

79
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,319
All right.

80
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,219
So it's not really what you're saying.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
It's kind of how you're saying it.

82
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:02,759
Right.

83
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,139
So it's kind of like by saying, he's really funny.

84
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,639
You're saying, yeah, he's a funny guy.

85
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,460
But if I say, oh, he's really funny, I'm saying, he's not funny.

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,580
He's being mean or he's a jerk.

87
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,099
He's a jerk.

88
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:23,540
Sarcasm is kind of one of those things that it's a little bit difficult to learn how to do or to actually get it right, especially in English, right?

89
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah, Marco.

90
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,660
Great explanation.

91
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,459
Exactly.

92
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:28,339
That's the way it goes.

93
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:28,660
Oh, yeah.

94
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:29,360
You're so funny.

95
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:29,980
Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,199
Wow.

97
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,959
You're amazing.

98
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,600
You should go to, you went to sarcasm school.

99
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,480
Oh, so my parents like to say.

100
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,560
You can be really mean, Catherine.

101
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,180
Sorry.

102
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:38,759
Just kidding.

103
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:39,360
All right.

104
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,040
So apart from being sarcastic, you can criticize someone.

105
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:44,439
Like you're ever critical.

106
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,399
All right.

107
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:46,860
Sorry.

108
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,399
I'll stop.

109
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,480
You're really into character right now.

110
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,560
So critical to criticize someone is to complain about them or to say that the things that they do are not very good.

111
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,680
So you can criticize a person or a movie.

112
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:00,579
Yeah.

113
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,319
So this movie wasn't very good.

114
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,199
It wasn't funny.

115
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,399
The actors were bad.

116
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,779
It was really long.

117
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,060
These are criticisms.

118
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,839
Criticisms.

119
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:08,600
All right.

120
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,899
Well, and then moving on, the girl was finally tired of the guy and his complaints.

121
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,300
And she said he's unbearable.

122
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,259
Gosh, you're unbearable.

123
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,500
So the root of this word is to be able to like to stand something, to bear it.

124
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,500
And so if you're unbearable, something is unbearable, you just can't stand it.

125
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,040
All right.

126
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,220
So you're tired of it.

127
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,319
You can't stand it.

128
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
She thinks he's so unbearable.

129
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,959
She makes him get out of the car.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,779
And she leaves.

131
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,180
She says, you can walk home.

133
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,500
All right.

134
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,920
So that's an unbearable person, right?

135
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:40,540
Mm hmm.

136
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,060
OK.

137
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,560
So we took a look at those four main words here in our dialogue.

138
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,019
Let's move on now to some of the phrases that we found in Fluency Builder.

139
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,420
Fluency Builder.

140
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:06,279
This first one's a common one, especially when we talk about women and men and the relationship between women and men, we say about men, that maybe they should be more in touch with their feelings or their feminine side.

141
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:07,720
OK.

142
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,360
So if you're saying to be more in touch with your feminine side, what exactly are you saying?

143
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,519
It's a good question.

144
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:25,180
Well, what you're saying is that you want to be able to express your feelings more or you want to be able to understand more about your feminine side or something like this.

145
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,279
So to be in touch with is more about yourself.

146
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,199
It's about self-reflection and self-understanding.

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,160
So you could say, I'm a very serious person, but I want to make some changes in my life.

148
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,040
So I'm trying to be more in touch with my inner child.

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,319
Your inner child.

150
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,199
Mm hmm.

151
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,860
All right.

152
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:43,399
So to be in touch with.

153
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,319
And it's usually related to feelings, to something intangible.

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,300
Or to behavior.

155
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,259
To behavior.

156
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,319
All right.

157
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,939
Moving on now, a heated phrase, a one night stand.

158
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
Oh, I'll let you explain this one, Marco.

159
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:57,959
All right.

160
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:05,939
So a one night stand is a casual and very quick temporal encounter that's usually a sexual encounter.

161
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,220
It's romantic, right?

162
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,180
So it can be between two different people.

163
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:11,939
They meet each other one night.

164
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
They have a relationship for one night only, and then they never see each other again.

165
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,779
So it's casual.

166
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,800
It's casual.

167
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,360
Very good.

168
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,819
So yeah, you would see this.

169
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,899
You see this a lot in shows like, you know, Sex in the City and yeah, they have a lot of one night stands in that show.

170
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:28,540
All right.

171
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,300
So a one night stand.

172
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,860
And well, related to this, the girl was criticizing his friends and she said, they're no saints.

173
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:37,839
Okay.

174
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,399
So you could say this in many different ways.

175
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,459
He's no saint.

176
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,600
She's no saint.

177
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,939
Or I'm no saint.

178
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,639
You're no saint.

179
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:45,120
So a saint is a good person.

180
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:53,879
It's a word that we use in religion to say someone who's like Mother Teresa or someone who's just really good and kind and doesn't commit any sins.

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,540
Exactly.

182
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,740
And so to say, I'm no saint is to say, well, I do bad things or I say bad things.

183
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,579
I'm not perfect.

184
00:07:59,899 --> 00:07:59,980
Okay.

185
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,480
So he or they, they're no saints.

186
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,939
They do bad stuff too.

187
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,240
Yeah.

188
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,660
Very good.

189
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,120
So that's the way that you would use.

190
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:07,019
He's no saints.

191
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:07,899
They're no saints.

192
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,120
All right.

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,720
So I think now we should listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

194
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,120
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

195
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,899
Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

196
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,319
Well, you should have picked in the end.

197
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,899
You always complain about everything.

198
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,419
Not everything, just this film.

199
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,440
Even the title was ridiculous.

200
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,220
And it's so long.

201
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,820
Those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

202
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,779
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

203
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,299
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

204
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,559
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

205
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,720
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

206
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,059
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

207
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,679
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

208
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,259
Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

209
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,340
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

210
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,360
At least he appreciates love stories.

211
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,639
Love stories?

212
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,720
More like one night stands.

213
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
Don't criticize Mario, or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours.

214
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,320
They're no scenes.

215
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,299
My friends?

216
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:20,940
Fat?

217
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,460
What about those whales you call friends?

218
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,779
You're unbearable.

219
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:25,879
You can walk home.

220
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,340
I'm leaving.

221
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:27,200
Fine.

222
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:45,559
All right, so, Catherine, is this an argument that you would say is typical among couples?

223
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,100
Or maybe people that are probably about to break up, right?

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,139
Not couples that are happy, I would say.

225
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,799
But yeah, you definitely have people who are, well, I guess it's kind of the battle of the sexes, right?

226
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,039
You have people who are different genders, and so they don't always understand each other.

227
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:08,500
You know, you want to have your girlfriends as a girl, and your girlfriends behave and talk in a certain way together, and guys do the same thing, but with their friends.

228
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,500
And so sometimes you have these clashes, these interactions that are negative, and you know when people are upset with each other, they say mean things.

229
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,440
And especially, I think in this case, they don't really like each other's friends.

230
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:29,100
And that's a kind of a common thing, like a guy doesn't like his girlfriend's friends because maybe they gossip too much, or something like that.

231
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,559
And the same thing with the girls, right?

232
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,539
Because a guy's friends maybe drink too much, play too many card games, they're single.

233
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:44,720
So I think a lot of times these problems also have to do with the fact that like when a girl is with her girlfriend, she maybe acts differently, or when a guy's with his guy friends.

234
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,620
And so that's weird sometimes for the relationship, because you see your partner acting differently with other people.

235
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,539
Do you like your boyfriend or girlfriend's friends?

236
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,340
Do you get in fights about this kind of stuff?

237
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,019
Or you know what?

238
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,759
The in-laws.

239
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,039
Ooh, that's a whole nother situation.

240
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:01,320
That's a whole nother situation.

241
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,620
