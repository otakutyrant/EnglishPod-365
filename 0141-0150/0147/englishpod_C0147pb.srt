00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today, Marco, you and I are talking about movies, right?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're talking a little bit about movies, but mostly we're having a big argument.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
OK, I kind of like arguments.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Lots of great words and phrases for you to learn here in English.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But we've got an upper intermediate level lesson with some people who are not getting along very well.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's a couple, a guy and a girl, and they're having a fight, as couples do.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So we're going to be learning a lot of the different language that they are using in this very heated debate.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time, and then we'll be right back.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Next time, I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, you should have picked.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But in the end, you always complain about everything.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Not everything, just this film.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Even the title is ridiculous.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And it's so long.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Those were the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You see?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's what I'm talking about.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
At least he appreciates love stories.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Love stories?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
More like one-night stands.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't criticize Mario, or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They're no saints.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
My friends?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Fat?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What about those whales you call friends?

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're unbearable.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You can walk home.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm leaving.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Fine.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we have four words, and the first one that you probably saw in the very first sentence is a chick flick.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Chick flick.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, first of all, the word chick means a woman, it's slang, and it's not very nice.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not very nice.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, I mean, between guys, you would use it as like, oh, this chick or that chick, but you wouldn't really walk up to a girl and call her a chick, right?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, you wouldn't say, hey, chick, what's up?

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Not something you want to say.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, so chick is a slang word for a girl or a woman, and a chick flick is a girl's movie.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So a flick is a movie.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Another slang word.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Exactly.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So this is the slang phrase for flick, so, hey, Marco, what flicks are showing at the movie theater?

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
All right.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, movies.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, and a chick flick is usually a romantic movie, a drama, something that's very...

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Like Beaches.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Beaches is a chick flick.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't know if you've ever seen that.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've never seen it.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So He's Just Not That Into You is one of those new chick flicks.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or like How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days or The Devil Wears Prada.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Bride Wars.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bride Wars.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wow, lots of chick flicks.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've actually never seen any one of these, except How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I've actually only seen that one.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All right.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So, chick flick is a girl's or woman's movie.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And next up, we have a word, sarcastic.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We're talking about sarcastic jokes.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So, sarcastic jokes or somebody being sarcastic.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
God, Marco, you're always so sarcastic.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So what would sarcasm sound like?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, he's really funny.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
All right.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So it's not really what you're saying.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's kind of how you're saying it.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Right.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So it's kind of like by saying, he's really funny.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're saying, yeah, he's a funny guy.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But if I say, oh, he's really funny, I'm saying, he's not funny.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's being mean or he's a jerk.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's a jerk.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sarcasm is kind of one of those things that it's a little bit difficult to learn how to do or to actually get it right, especially in English, right?

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, Marco.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Great explanation.

91
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Exactly.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's the way it goes.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh, yeah.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're so funny.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, yeah.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wow.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're amazing.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You should go to, you went to sarcasm school.

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, so my parents like to say.

100
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can be really mean, Catherine.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sorry.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Just kidding.

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So apart from being sarcastic, you can criticize someone.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Like you're ever critical.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sorry.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll stop.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're really into character right now.

110
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So critical to criticize someone is to complain about them or to say that the things that they do are not very good.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So you can criticize a person or a movie.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So this movie wasn't very good.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It wasn't funny.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The actors were bad.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It was really long.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
These are criticisms.

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Criticisms.

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right.

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, and then moving on, the girl was finally tired of the guy and his complaints.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And she said he's unbearable.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Gosh, you're unbearable.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So the root of this word is to be able to like to stand something, to bear it.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And so if you're unbearable, something is unbearable, you just can't stand it.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
All right.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So you're tired of it.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can't stand it.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
She thinks he's so unbearable.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
She makes him get out of the car.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And she leaves.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She says, you can walk home.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right.

134
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's an unbearable person, right?

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mm hmm.

136
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
OK.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So we took a look at those four main words here in our dialogue.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's move on now to some of the phrases that we found in Fluency Builder.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Fluency Builder.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This first one's a common one, especially when we talk about women and men and the relationship between women and men, we say about men, that maybe they should be more in touch with their feelings or their feminine side.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
OK.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So if you're saying to be more in touch with your feminine side, what exactly are you saying?

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a good question.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, what you're saying is that you want to be able to express your feelings more or you want to be able to understand more about your feminine side or something like this.

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So to be in touch with is more about yourself.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's about self-reflection and self-understanding.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So you could say, I'm a very serious person, but I want to make some changes in my life.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So I'm trying to be more in touch with my inner child.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Your inner child.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Mm hmm.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So to be in touch with.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
And it's usually related to feelings, to something intangible.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Or to behavior.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
To behavior.

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
All right.

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Moving on now, a heated phrase, a one night stand.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, I'll let you explain this one, Marco.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
All right.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So a one night stand is a casual and very quick temporal encounter that's usually a sexual encounter.

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's romantic, right?

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So it can be between two different people.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They meet each other one night.

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They have a relationship for one night only, and then they never see each other again.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's casual.

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's casual.

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Very good.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So yeah, you would see this.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You see this a lot in shows like, you know, Sex in the City and yeah, they have a lot of one night stands in that show.

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So a one night stand.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And well, related to this, the girl was criticizing his friends and she said, they're no saints.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So you could say this in many different ways.

175
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's no saint.

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
She's no saint.

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Or I'm no saint.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're no saint.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So a saint is a good person.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's a word that we use in religion to say someone who's like Mother Teresa or someone who's just really good and kind and doesn't commit any sins.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Exactly.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And so to say, I'm no saint is to say, well, I do bad things or I say bad things.

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm not perfect.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So he or they, they're no saints.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
They do bad stuff too.

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah.

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Very good.

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So that's the way that you would use.

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's no saints.

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
They're no saints.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
All right.

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So I think now we should listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Well, you should have picked in the end.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You always complain about everything.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Not everything, just this film.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Even the title was ridiculous.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And it's so long.

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

204
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I thought we could have a nice evening, but you're always so negative.

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Next time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

210
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At least he appreciates love stories.

211
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Love stories?

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
More like one night stands.

213
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't criticize Mario, or else I'll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They're no scenes.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
My friends?

216
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Fat?

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What about those whales you call friends?

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're unbearable.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can walk home.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm leaving.

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Fine.

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All right, so, Catherine, is this an argument that you would say is typical among couples?

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or maybe people that are probably about to break up, right?

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Not couples that are happy, I would say.

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But yeah, you definitely have people who are, well, I guess it's kind of the battle of the sexes, right?

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have people who are different genders, and so they don't always understand each other.

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You know, you want to have your girlfriends as a girl, and your girlfriends behave and talk in a certain way together, and guys do the same thing, but with their friends.

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so sometimes you have these clashes, these interactions that are negative, and you know when people are upset with each other, they say mean things.

229
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And especially, I think in this case, they don't really like each other's friends.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And that's a kind of a common thing, like a guy doesn't like his girlfriend's friends because maybe they gossip too much, or something like that.

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And the same thing with the girls, right?

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Because a guy's friends maybe drink too much, play too many card games, they're single.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I think a lot of times these problems also have to do with the fact that like when a girl is with her girlfriend, she maybe acts differently, or when a guy's with his guy friends.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And so that's weird sometimes for the relationship, because you see your partner acting differently with other people.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you like your boyfriend or girlfriend's friends?

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you get in fights about this kind of stuff?

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Or you know what?

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The in-laws.

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ooh, that's a whole nother situation.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's a whole nother situation.

241
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
