1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, you should have picked.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the end you always complain about everything.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Not everything.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just this film.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Even the title was ridiculous.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And it's so long.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Those were the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought we could have a nice evening but you're always so negative.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
At least he appreciates love stories.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Love stories?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
More like one night stands.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat drunk friends of yours.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They're no scenes.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My friends?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Fat?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What about those whales you call friends?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're unbearable.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can walk home.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm leaving.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Fine.
