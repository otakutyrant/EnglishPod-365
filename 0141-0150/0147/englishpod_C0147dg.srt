1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,400
Wow, that terrible movie is finally over.

2
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,199
Next time I'm picking the film because I don't want to end up seeing a chick flick.

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,060
Well, you should have picked.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,160
In the end you always complain about everything.

5
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,460
Not everything.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,660
Just this film.

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,699
Even the title was ridiculous.

8
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,460
And it's so long.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,100
Those were the two and a half most wasted hours of my life.

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,059
So much so that I'm thinking about asking them to give me my money back.

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,579
I'm thinking of taking you back home.

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:36,840
I thought we could have a nice evening but you're always so negative.

13
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.

14
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,340
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,960
I can't stand your sarcastic jokes anymore.

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,560
Next time go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,619
Well, he's more of a man than you are.

18
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,640
At least he appreciates love stories.

19
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:56,939
Love stories?

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
More like one night stands.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,619
Don't criticize Mario or else I'll start on those fat drunk friends of yours.

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,620
They're no scenes.

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,599
My friends?

24
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:06,219
Fat?

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,739
What about those whales you call friends?

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
You're unbearable.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,159
You can walk home.

28
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:11,620
I'm leaving.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,480
Fine.
