00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Catherine and today we're talking about one of my least favorite things, Marco.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Mosquitoes.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mosquitoes.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They're all over the place, especially in summer or near water.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And for me the worst part is when you are trying to sleep and there's a mosquito that just keeps on biting you and won't let you sleep.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can kind of hear it around your head, you know, by your ears.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, I hate that.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Or when you just get bitten and you're in bed and it just itches so much.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And it burns sometimes.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, so that's what we're talking about today.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Fun stuff.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's jump right into this dialogue and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The mosquitoes are biting me!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Me too.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't stop scratching.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
They're everywhere, sneaky little jerks.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you have any bug spray?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No, I forgot to buy some.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then we'll have to put up with it.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We can cover ourselves with beer.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's without doubt the best idea you've ever had.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's do it.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Run!

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They're thirsty for more!

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Alright, we're back, so let's take a look at some of these words in Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, so as we mentioned, we're going to be talking about mosquitoes.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And, well, these are just little small insects that suck your blood.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They do, and they're very thin, and not much to say about them.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They were very important in the movie Jurassic Park, if you remember that.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Right.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, what's the difference between a mosquito and a fly?

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, a fly usually is just annoying.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It doesn't suck your blood.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But a mosquito does.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It sucks your blood.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And flies are fatter and, like, shorter.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And they're big and black or green, kind of, sometimes.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
They're black and green, and they just buzz around.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And mosquitoes actually bite you.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay, so a mosquito and a fly.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, if a mosquito bites you, you really, really want to scratch.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, you feel like you need to scratch your body because you have this bite.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You know, it's really an allergy.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And you have a red bump on your arm, a red mark.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And you scratch, and it gets worse and worse.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And moving on to our next word.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mosquitoes have a reputation of being sneaky.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, so you can say sneaky about a lot of things.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Obviously, we're saying mosquitoes are very sneaky.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That means that they can kind of hide and get you when you're not expecting it.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, because sometimes during the day, you don't really see them in your room, right?

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They're hiding, or they're in a place where you can't really see them.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And then at night, all of a sudden, they come out.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They come out.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And they're very hard to see.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They fly around in a way that's very difficult to catch them or kill them, right?

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right, we could say thieves are very sneaky.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Like, a thief is someone who steals something, and they like to sneak around and hide in the dark.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then when you're not expecting it, they come out and they steal your stuff.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Exactly.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And now, what do we do or what do we use in order to prevent mosquitoes from biting us?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is essential, especially if you're going to the beach.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We bring bug spray.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Bug spray.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, a spray is something that you can usually have in a can that you push a button and it comes out, right?

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's like water, but it keeps the bugs away.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So, bug spray keeps bugs away.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not only mosquitoes, but like flies or any other type of bug.

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, specifically for mosquitoes, you would use maybe a mosquito repellent.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Right, so repellent means something that pushes or keeps away things you don't want.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So, something that keeps mosquitoes away is called a mosquito repellent, and usually it's a cream you put on your arms or legs.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Alright, very good.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, interesting words that we've just taken a look at.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be right back.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The mosquitoes are biting me!

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Me too!

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't stop scratching!

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks!

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you have any bug spray?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, I forgot to buy some.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Then we'll have to put up with it.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We can cover ourselves with beer.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That way, if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's, without doubt, the best idea you've ever had.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's do it!

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Run!

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
They're thirsty for more!

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Alright, so the first phrase is very, very common.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The person in the dialogue says that they're going to have to put up with it.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Put up with these mosquitoes because they didn't have any bug spray.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So this phrase, to put up with, is really important.

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Alright, so if you put up with something, it means that you tolerate it.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Alright, that means even if you don't want to, you'll still handle it.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You'll still have to deal with it.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You accept it.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So maybe you have a little brother that's very annoying and you just have to put up with him.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's no other option.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Or someone says to you, you're just going to have to put up with it.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Or you say, I won't put up with it anymore.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I won't handle this anymore.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm done.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Alright, so I think this is a great phrase for us to take a look at a couple of different examples.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can't put up with the noise any longer.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Turn that music down.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you can put up with the smell, then stinky tofu is actually very tasty.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've had to put up with him for too long.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I want a new roommate.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And after this, we've got another phrase.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're talking about beer, okay?

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And so the person says, oh I have an idea.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Instead of bug spray, we can cover ourselves with beer.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So to cover yourself or cover ourselves.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So it means that we put it all over us.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Right, so you could even cover yourself with bug spray.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, so every part of your body you put bug spray on.

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Head to toe.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Head to toe.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now you can cover yourself under a tree maybe.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Or you can cover yourself with a blanket.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, so to cover yourself, to completely hide under something.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And finally we have the response to this idea, the answer.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The person says, oh, without a doubt.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That means absolutely or definitely.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay, so there is no doubt.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is true or it is certain.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right, so a doubt is something that maybe you're not so sure about.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're not convinced.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But you can say this is without a doubt the best mosquito spray.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or this is without a doubt the best cake I've ever eaten.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That means it's definitely the best cake I've ever eaten.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Alright, so I think we've covered all the phrases now.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Bug spray?

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, I forgot to buy some.

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Then we'll have to put up with it.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We can cover ourselves with beer.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's without a doubt the best idea you've ever had.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Let's do it.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Run, they're thirsty for more.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mosquitoes are very annoying but at times they can be very dangerous, right?

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
They can.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There are a couple of diseases that can be passed by mosquito bites.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
One of them is malaria and that's I think pretty common in Southeast Asia and South Asia.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now there was another situation where people believed that if a mosquito bit a person infected with HIV or AIDS, they could pass it on to another person.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Aha, well I don't know that that's even possible because there's no AIDS carrying mosquitoes.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But there is another disease called dengue fever.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Dengue fever, yes.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And this is another very dangerous one.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's also known as break bone fever.

158
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I think it's so painful it feels like your bones are breaking and that's where the name comes from.

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's very common in South America as well because we have such a tropical climate that in the rainforests of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, it's common to see this but not so much anymore.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Now they're eradicating it.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Alright, so an interesting topic.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Mosquitoes are not only irritating but can be dangerous.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
