00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:05,940
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:06,639
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,800
And my name is Catherine and today we're talking about one of my least favorite things, Marco.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,960
Mosquitoes.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,380
Mosquitoes.

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,719
They're all over the place, especially in summer or near water.

7
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,339
And for me the worst part is when you are trying to sleep and there's a mosquito that just keeps on biting you and won't let you sleep.

8
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:30,179
You can kind of hear it around your head, you know, by your ears.

9
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,600
Oh, I hate that.

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,460
Or when you just get bitten and you're in bed and it just itches so much.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,799
And it burns sometimes.

12
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,159
Yeah, so that's what we're talking about today.

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:39,920
Fun stuff.

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,500
Let's jump right into this dialogue and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,000
The mosquitoes are biting me!

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,100
Me too.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,640
I can't stop scratching.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,460
They're everywhere, sneaky little jerks.

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,439
Do you have any bug spray?

20
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,560
No, I forgot to buy some.

21
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,659
Then we'll have to put up with it.

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,859
We can cover ourselves with beer.

23
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,219
That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

24
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,079
That's without doubt the best idea you've ever had.

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,280
Let's do it.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,359
Run!

27
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:23,840
They're thirsty for more!

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,299
Alright, we're back, so let's take a look at some of these words in Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,280
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:42,379
Alright, so as we mentioned, we're going to be talking about mosquitoes.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,040
And, well, these are just little small insects that suck your blood.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,060
They do, and they're very thin, and not much to say about them.

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,340
They were very important in the movie Jurassic Park, if you remember that.

34
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:56,280
Right.

35
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,540
Now, what's the difference between a mosquito and a fly?

36
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,840
Okay, a fly usually is just annoying.

37
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,180
It doesn't suck your blood.

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,719
But a mosquito does.

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,680
It sucks your blood.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,900
And flies are fatter and, like, shorter.

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,539
And they're big and black or green, kind of, sometimes.

42
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,860
They're black and green, and they just buzz around.

43
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:21,199
And mosquitoes actually bite you.

44
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,520
Okay, so a mosquito and a fly.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,699
Now, if a mosquito bites you, you really, really want to scratch.

46
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,840
That's right.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,039
So, you feel like you need to scratch your body because you have this bite.

48
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,099
You know, it's really an allergy.

49
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,639
And you have a red bump on your arm, a red mark.

50
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,379
And you scratch, and it gets worse and worse.

51
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,020
Alright.

52
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,599
And moving on to our next word.

53
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,439
Mosquitoes have a reputation of being sneaky.

54
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,159
Okay, so you can say sneaky about a lot of things.

55
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:52,139
Obviously, we're saying mosquitoes are very sneaky.

56
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,159
That means that they can kind of hide and get you when you're not expecting it.

57
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,319
Yeah, because sometimes during the day, you don't really see them in your room, right?

58
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,199
They're hiding, or they're in a place where you can't really see them.

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,400
And then at night, all of a sudden, they come out.

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,099
They come out.

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,939
And they're very hard to see.

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,159
They fly around in a way that's very difficult to catch them or kill them, right?

63
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,080
Right, we could say thieves are very sneaky.

64
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:21,479
Like, a thief is someone who steals something, and they like to sneak around and hide in the dark.

65
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,560
And then when you're not expecting it, they come out and they steal your stuff.

66
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,400
Exactly.

67
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,759
And now, what do we do or what do we use in order to prevent mosquitoes from biting us?

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,639
This is essential, especially if you're going to the beach.

69
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,539
We bring bug spray.

70
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:36,240
Bug spray.

71
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,060
So, a spray is something that you can usually have in a can that you push a button and it comes out, right?

72
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,539
It's like water, but it keeps the bugs away.

73
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,240
So, bug spray keeps bugs away.

74
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,259
Not only mosquitoes, but like flies or any other type of bug.

75
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, specifically for mosquitoes, you would use maybe a mosquito repellent.

76
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,580
Right, so repellent means something that pushes or keeps away things you don't want.

77
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,759
So, something that keeps mosquitoes away is called a mosquito repellent, and usually it's a cream you put on your arms or legs.

78
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,159
Alright, very good.

79
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,680
So, interesting words that we've just taken a look at.

80
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,819
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be right back.

81
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,420
The mosquitoes are biting me!

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,579
Me too!

83
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,079
I can't stop scratching!

84
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,939
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks!

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,980
Do you have any bug spray?

86
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,040
No, I forgot to buy some.

87
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,120
Then we'll have to put up with it.

88
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,339
We can cover ourselves with beer.

89
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,720
That way, if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

90
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,579
That's, without doubt, the best idea you've ever had.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,579
Let's do it!

92
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,660
Run!

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,060
They're thirsty for more!

94
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,980
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

95
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,579
Alright, so the first phrase is very, very common.

96
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,639
The person in the dialogue says that they're going to have to put up with it.

97
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,339
Put up with these mosquitoes because they didn't have any bug spray.

98
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,579
So this phrase, to put up with, is really important.

99
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:19,819
Alright, so if you put up with something, it means that you tolerate it.

100
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,800
Alright, that means even if you don't want to, you'll still handle it.

101
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,899
You'll still have to deal with it.

102
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:25,600
You accept it.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,800
So maybe you have a little brother that's very annoying and you just have to put up with him.

104
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,800
There's no other option.

105
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Or someone says to you, you're just going to have to put up with it.

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,500
Or you say, I won't put up with it anymore.

107
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,259
I won't handle this anymore.

108
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm done.

109
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:47,000
Alright, so I think this is a great phrase for us to take a look at a couple of different examples.

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,660
I can't put up with the noise any longer.

111
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,560
Turn that music down.

112
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,199
If you can put up with the smell, then stinky tofu is actually very tasty.

113
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,620
I've had to put up with him for too long.

114
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:10,100
I want a new roommate.

115
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,180
And after this, we've got another phrase.

116
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:17,519
We're talking about beer, okay?

117
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,579
And so the person says, oh I have an idea.

118
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:24,199
Instead of bug spray, we can cover ourselves with beer.

119
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:27,699
So to cover yourself or cover ourselves.

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,139
So it means that we put it all over us.

121
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,519
Right, so you could even cover yourself with bug spray.

122
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,920
Okay, so every part of your body you put bug spray on.

123
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,079
Head to toe.

124
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:39,759
Head to toe.

125
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,959
Now you can cover yourself under a tree maybe.

126
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,540
Or you can cover yourself with a blanket.

127
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,300
Okay, so to cover yourself, to completely hide under something.

128
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,180
And finally we have the response to this idea, the answer.

129
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,920
The person says, oh, without a doubt.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,459
That means absolutely or definitely.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,600
Okay, so there is no doubt.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,639
It is true or it is certain.

133
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,060
Right, so a doubt is something that maybe you're not so sure about.

134
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
You're not convinced.

135
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,699
But you can say this is without a doubt the best mosquito spray.

136
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,060
Or this is without a doubt the best cake I've ever eaten.

137
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,660
That means it's definitely the best cake I've ever eaten.

138
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,800
Alright, so I think we've covered all the phrases now.

139
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,439
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be right back.

140
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:43,319
Bug spray?

141
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,439
No, I forgot to buy some.

142
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,519
Then we'll have to put up with it.

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,720
We can cover ourselves with beer.

144
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,079
That way if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep.

145
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,959
That's without a doubt the best idea you've ever had.

146
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:01,120
Let's do it.

147
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,720
Run, they're thirsty for more.

148
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,579
Mosquitoes are very annoying but at times they can be very dangerous, right?

149
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:18,579
They can.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,139
There are a couple of diseases that can be passed by mosquito bites.

151
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,819
One of them is malaria and that's I think pretty common in Southeast Asia and South Asia.

152
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:36,779
Now there was another situation where people believed that if a mosquito bit a person infected with HIV or AIDS, they could pass it on to another person.

153
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,399
Aha, well I don't know that that's even possible because there's no AIDS carrying mosquitoes.

154
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,580
But there is another disease called dengue fever.

155
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,399
Dengue fever, yes.

156
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,019
And this is another very dangerous one.

157
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,940
It's also known as break bone fever.

158
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:53,559
And I think it's so painful it feels like your bones are breaking and that's where the name comes from.

159
00:08:53,559 --> 00:09:04,779
It's very common in South America as well because we have such a tropical climate that in the rainforests of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, it's common to see this but not so much anymore.

160
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Now they're eradicating it.

161
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,580
Alright, so an interesting topic.

162
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,559
Mosquitoes are not only irritating but can be dangerous.

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,159
