00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,259
EnglishPod.com The mosquitoes are biting me!

2
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:09,400
Me too!

3
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,900
I can't stop scratching!

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,740
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks!

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,740
Do you have any bug spray?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,839
No, I forgot to buy some.

7
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,940
Then we'll have to put up with it.

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,120
We can...cover ourselves with beer!

9
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:26,519
That way, if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep!

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,640
That's, without doubt, the...

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,359
Best idea you've ever had!

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:33,479
Let's do it!

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,640
Run!

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,060
They're thirsty for more!
