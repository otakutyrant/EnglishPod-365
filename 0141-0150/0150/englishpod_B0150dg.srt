00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com The mosquitoes are biting me!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Me too!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can't stop scratching!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They are everywhere, sneaky little jerks!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Do you have any bug spray?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, I forgot to buy some.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then we'll have to put up with it.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We can...cover ourselves with beer!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That way, if they bite us, they'll get drunk and fall asleep!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's, without doubt, the...

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Best idea you've ever had!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's do it!

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Run!

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They're thirsty for more!
