00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, Marco, today we're talking about rent and housing.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're actually going to be moving.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to be going to a new apartment or a new house.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And so we're going to look at all the words related to this, because sometimes it can be a real hassle, right?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It can be really difficult.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Absolutely.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, you love moving, right?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You were telling me how much you love moving your stuff and negotiating a new lease.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, I like the negotiation of the lease, but not the moving aspect.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, I don't think anyone likes moving.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Actually, I do like it at times, because then you can just throw away so many things that you have no need for and you wouldn't throw away unless you moved.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So let's go check out today's dialogue to find out what happens to the characters.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, that's fine, bye.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What happened?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's it.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
My lease is up.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have to move.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why?

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Can't you renew it?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, I can help you pack.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sure.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All right, we're back, so well, it's not much of a big deal.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I guess if you have your parents nearby, you can just move back in with your parents.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Easier said than done.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
True, true.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We'll get to that in a little bit, but let's take a look at the words that are used today in Language Takeaway.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right, so this first one is an important one because generally when you're looking for a house or an apartment, there are two things you can do.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You can buy a house or you can lease a house or apartment.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, lease here, Marco.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's basically to rent, right?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a contract where you agree to pay a monthly or a quarterly fee for using that house or apartment.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So, do you own your apartment or do you lease it?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I lease.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am not a homeowner yet.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Right, so owning a home is a lot more expensive at one kind of period where you have to just pay in and you have maybe a mortgage, but leasing is just a monthly fee, like you said.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So in this case, they had to leave because their lease was expired.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Exactly, so you can at the end of a lease do one of two things.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can stop and you can find a new apartment or you can renew your lease.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right, and that's our next word.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To renew your lease basically means to?

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
To continue.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
To continue.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And this is actually a good word because it can be used with any contract because really a lease is a kind of contract.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so I can say, I renewed my job contract.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Or maybe a magazine subscription.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You renewed your magazine subscription.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's a way of saying that you've committed to paying for the next six months or one year.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, well and after that, as we said, the person decided to move in with the parents.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So move in.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Move in, well we can say he moved his car, he put it in a different place, but to move in is actually to change houses or to change apartments.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And you're literally moving your things and you're moving your clothes and you're moving into a new home, so you're living in a new place.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So in this case, this person is going to live with the parents.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Move in.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
All right.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And our next word is when you have to move, you have to pack.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, so you can pack a lot of things.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In this case, you're packing a box with all of your belongings, your books and your pillows and all that.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But you can also pack a suitcase or you can pack luggage.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So packing is putting things into something so that you can move them.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So you can carry them or take them somewhere.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Exactly.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So in this case, you have to pack your things, put them in boxes to take them to your new home.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And our last word is an acronym when you said ASAP.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Snap, snap.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
ASAP, Marco.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Describe this for us quickly.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All right.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So ASAP is an acronym for as soon as possible.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, so you often see this in the office on envelopes or emails.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So please respond ASAP.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This means please respond right away.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As soon as you can.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
As soon as possible.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
All right.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So five great words that we've just taken a look at.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be right back.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's fine.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Bye.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What happened?

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's it.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My lease is up.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have to move.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Why?

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Can't you renew it?

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, I can help you pack.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of days.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
a couple of months until I can find something.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sure.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right, we're back and we have a couple of different phrases for you.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So let's look at those now in fluency builder.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Fluency builder.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Our first one's a little bit unusual.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We heard the phrase.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My lease is up.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So Marco, let's talk about this phrase to be up.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All right.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So if something is up, as in this case, the lease, it means it's expired.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's finished.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Right.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So it's over.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You can also say our time is up right if we have a meeting.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So that's all the time I have time to go away.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Time is up.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Very good.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So it's always related to time or maybe a contract, as in this case, or your lease is up.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So it means over or finished.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All right.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So moving on to our second phrase.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To make way for.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So this is a great one.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This often makes me think of kings and queens in the old days to say, make way for the king.

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So you have to get out of the way or to clear some space for them to move because there's too much stuff in the way.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And so in this case, the owner of the apartment with the guy was living in is trying to make some space or make way for a parking lot.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So he's basically going to sell the building or house and build a parking lot instead.

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So they are making way for the new parking lot.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
They're clearing space.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And this is actually really sad because my childhood home, they destroyed to make way for a larger, ugly, big building house.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, really?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
See, it happens all the time.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now they're making way for malls and big buildings and all of our little houses are destroyed.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And well, moving on to our last phrase, the person asked the friend if he would mind looking after the pet snake and tarantula.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I would mind.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You don't like snakes or tarantulas.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't mind them as long as I don't live with them.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So would you mind how, this is a nice way to start a sentence if you want to ask for a favor, right?

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Exactly.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So here's an alternative.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hey, Marco, can you do this for me?

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I could maybe.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I could say, Marco, would you mind doing this for me?

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It sounds, it's more polite.

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It is more polite and it's a little bit gentler.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So it's nice.

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's a nice way of asking someone for a favor.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Exactly.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And that's why this is funny because the favor is not like, would you mind watching my kitty?

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The favor is, would you mind watching my poisonous pets?

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All right.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So would you mind it?

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But in the end, the person agreed.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it works, right?

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It does work.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So would you mind, so listeners, would you mind listening to today's dialogue one more time at its normal speed before we come back to you and talk more about renting an apartment?

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, that's fine.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Bye.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What happened?

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's it.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
My lease is up.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have to move.

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why?

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Can't you renew it?

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Well, I can help you pack.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Sure.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All right, so moving in now, you have different stages in your life, right?

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
When you move out, for example, you move out of your parents' home and you live on your own, and then maybe, like in this case, you would move back in with your parents.

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How do you see that happening?

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I see it very often.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My brother just moved back in with my parents.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Really?

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, I think that it depends on the person, honestly, especially because the economy has really been suffering for the last year.

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A lot of people are doing this because in a lot of cities in America, you can spend $1,000 to $2,000 a month for an apartment to rent, and that's a small apartment or a shared apartment.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And so, I understand this is a really, well, it's a better option now than it was before because everyone wants independence, but sometimes you just can't afford it.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Exactly, and it's a cultural thing because some people move out of their parents' home maybe for college.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's very common in the U.S.

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to study in another city or another state, right?

200
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But then maybe coming back home and moving in with your parents, or in other cultures, maybe they don't move out at all.

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Maybe they only move out once they're married.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Exactly.

203
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So, a lot of people in China, I think in Shanghai specifically, don't move out of their parents' home until they're going to get married.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And it does make sense in many big metropolis because, as you say, rent is expensive, living on your own is expensive, and, well, you don't have anyone to share those costs with like gas, water, electricity, even food, right?

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's cheaper among more people.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And not to mention a little bit scary living on your own for the first time.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It is a little bit scary.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What about having somebody move in with you?

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Maybe a roommate or a girlfriend or boyfriend?

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's always the big step.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The big commitment?

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The big commitment.

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're in a relationship and you ask your partner to move in with you.

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The step before marriage, I guess.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wow.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There's nothing before that?

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Nothing before marriage?

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's pretty much it.

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You tell me.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't know.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All right.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's all the time we have for today.

225

232

Bye.
