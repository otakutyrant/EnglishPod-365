00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,200
EnglishPod.com Okay, that's fine.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,559
Bye.

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:09,099
What happened?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:09,960
That's it.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,019
My lease is up.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,919
I have to move.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:12,779
What?

8
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:13,660
Why?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Can't you renew it?

10
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,120
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

11
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,179
Well, I can help you pack.

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,300
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,640
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

15
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:37,020
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

16
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,359
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,500
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:50,619
Sure.
