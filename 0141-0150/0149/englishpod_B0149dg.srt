00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, that's fine.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Bye.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What happened?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's it.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My lease is up.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I have to move.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Can't you renew it?

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, I can help you pack.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You know how hard it is to find a decent place around here.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, let me know if there's anything I can do to help out.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Actually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sure.
