00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Catherine, and we've got a great lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What level is this, Marco?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is an elementary lesson, and we're going to be touching one of these medical topics.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, we're going to talk about chicken pox.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh, gosh, I hated the chicken pox.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They're horrible, and they itch, and you can't do anything about it, and your parents say don't scratch.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So chicken pox is an illness that you get usually as a child, and what happens is you start getting these little red dots all over your body, like little mosquito bites.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Exactly, and they come all over your body, arms, legs, face, and you can only get this disease once unless maybe you didn't really get it too seriously.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So most people get this when they're children.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Exactly, and what makes you very uncomfortable when you get chicken pox, as you said, it's these little red dots, they itch just like mosquito bites, but you can't scratch because if you do, then your skin gets marked, right?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have stains.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Forever, like scars.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So it's best not to scratch, and that's what we're going to talk about today.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Somebody has the chicken pox.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll be right back.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you scratching so much?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I feel itchy.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can't stand it anymore.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think I may be coming down with something.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I feel lightheaded and weak.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let me have a look.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Whoa, get away from me.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's wrong?

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I think you have chicken pox.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're contagious.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Get away.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't breathe on me.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We can't be sure until I see a doctor.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, in the meantime, you're a biohazard.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't get it when I was a kid, and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you serious?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You always blow things out of proportion.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ew.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right, we're back, so I think this kid does have the chicken pox.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Definitely, and well, he's got a funny solution for it.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But before we get there, we've got a lot of great medical words and just basic body words for you in today's language takeaway.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, so let's start with our first word.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He mentioned that he felt itchy.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I feel itchy.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Itchy.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, okay, this is often confused.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Even among children who are native speakers of English, there are two words, to itch and to scratch.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But this person is itchy.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So it means that your skin, you want to scratch it.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It may be uncomfortable.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Like, a mosquito bite is itchy.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, so itchy would be the adjective, right?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
To the noun, an itch.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So if you have an itch, you feel itchy, right?

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Exactly.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, and that's when you scratch.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
All right.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hopefully not.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He feels itchy, and he also felt a little bit lightheaded.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, so you know the word head.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You know the word light.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So here we have a person who feels lightheaded.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It means that you kind of feel a little bit strange, and your head is a little bit, well, what's a good word to describe it?

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Like dizzy.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, almost dizzy or faint.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So you usually feel a little bit weak.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't really feel very well.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Your head is lightheaded.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The complete opposite of having a headache, right?

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Exactly.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And, well, then the girl got scared, and she said, get away.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You are contagious.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, gosh.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, this is a dangerous one.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Someone who is contagious can pass their illness to someone else.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So, for example, the flu is very contagious, and if I have the flu, Marco doesn't want me to, you know, come over and touch all of his stuff and sneeze and cough into his food.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Right.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Exactly.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So that's contagious.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's an adjective, and that means that you easily pass your illness to another person.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So why don't we take a look at a couple of different examples using this word contagious.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Example one.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't get near me.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Chicken pox are very contagious.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Example two.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The sickness that is going around the office is very contagious.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Example three.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
H1N1 flu is very contagious.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So you want to avoid contagious people, but you might also want to avoid people who have this next word.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's called a rash.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A rash.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Exactly.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So why do you want to avoid people who have a rash?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, they might have a contagious rash.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who knows?

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But you can get a rash for a number of different reasons.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sometimes a rash is just basically a part of your skin that becomes irritated or uncomfortable, and sometimes it turns red or pink.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Exactly.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So as you said, it happens for different reasons.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sometimes you maybe have bad seafood in your skin, and you start to have rashes all over your body.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Other times you can touch some plants that are dangerous, like poison ivy or poison oak.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And then you get a big rash.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And our last word for today is a little bit dramatic.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She called him a biohazard.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Biohazard.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, let's take a look at these words individually.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The first word, bio, comes from the word biology.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So that's something that is alive.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
An animal, a plant, or a person.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And hazard is something that is dangerous.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So biohazard is a, well, something that's alive that's dangerous.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Right.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Or that's dangerous towards a living person, right, or organism.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
For example, you don't want to be near an area that has a lot of radiation.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a biohazard.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Exactly.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Or some of these diseases like Ebola virus.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
These are very dangerous towards living things.

124
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And so biohazard is the name for it.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And usually there's a symbol, a very clear symbol that kind of looks like a triangle, and it's red.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And even in movies it's appeared, right?

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think in that movie.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's red or yellow.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, sometimes both.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright, so biohazard.

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think we've taken a look at a lot of words, so why don't we listen to this dialogue again.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's slow it down a little bit, see if we can understand a little bit more.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What's wrong with you?

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Why are you scratching so much?

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I feel itchy.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't stand it anymore.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think I may be coming down with something.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I feel light-headed and weak.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me have a look.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Whoa.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Get away from me.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's wrong?

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think you have the chicken pox.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're contagious.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Get away.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't breathe on me.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We can't be sure until I see a doctor.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Well, in the meantime, you are a biohazard.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I didn't get it when I was a kid, and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you serious?

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You always blow things out of proportion.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ew.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Alright, we're back, so now why don't we take a look at fluency builder and start taking a look at all these phrases.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Fluency builder.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, the first one is something that we often say when we're starting to feel ill.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This phrase is coming down with, so I could say, I think I'm coming down with a cold, for example.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So basically you say, I'm coming down with something, so a cold, or I think I'm coming down with the flu.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So you're saying that I think I'm getting ill?

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Exactly, it means I'm just starting to feel sick.

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And so you could say, I've had a cold for a week, you wouldn't use the phrase I'm coming down with in this situation.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You'd only use it when you're starting to feel sick.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Very good.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So you could ask your boss, eh, I think I'm coming down with the flu, can I go home early?

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right, and I think this is a very useful phrase, it's very natural to say, so why don't we listen to a couple of other examples.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Example one.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Honey, will you take my temperature?

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I think I'm coming down with something.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Example two.

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You must be coming down with a cold.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Example three.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Tommy came down with the flu.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Alright, so coming down with, coming down with the flu, coming down with a cough, etc.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Alright, what's our next phrase?

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, this one's great, it's a filler phrase, so, in the meantime.

177
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In the meantime.

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I could say, alright, I'm gonna go cook dinner, in the meantime, Marco, can you please clear the table?

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, so while you are cooking dinner, I am doing something else, I'm cleaning the table.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Exactly, so two things happening at the same time.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
In the meantime, very good, so it's a filler you say.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because usually it follows another phrase, so I'm gonna be doing this report for a while, in the meantime, can you just wait here on the sofa, please?

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, very good.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So in the meantime.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you're connecting two different actions, two different ideas.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Very good, in the meantime.

187
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And what about our last phrase?

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Alright, there are some people who really like to do this, and I might be one of them.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's called to blow things out of proportion.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Alright, and you're gonna hear this phrase a lot with native English speakers.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And so to blow things out of proportion, well, it pretty much means that you're exaggerating or you're making a really big deal out of something that's not very serious.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So, for example, if you come over to my house and you break a glass and I start freaking out and yelling at you because you broke my glass.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I say, Marco, you're blowing things out of proportion, I'll just buy you a new one, it's not that serious.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Alright, so don't exaggerate, right?

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So oftentimes you feel like this with siblings, spouses, or bosses who react very seriously.

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So you can say, hey, stop yelling, you're blowing things out of proportion, this is not a really big deal.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Exactly, alright.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So blowing things out of proportion, let's not do that, but let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll be back.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What's wrong with you?

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why are you scratching so much?

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I feel itchy.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't stand it anymore.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think I may be coming down with something.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I feel light-headed and weak.

205
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let me have a look.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Whoa, get away from me!

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What's wrong?

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think you have chicken pox.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're contagious.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Get away, don't breathe on me.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Maybe it's just a rash or an allergy.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We can't be sure until I see a doctor.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, in the meantime, you're a biohazard.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I didn't get it when I was a kid and I've heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Are you serious?

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You always blow things out of proportion.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
In any case, I think I'll go take an oatmeal bath.

218
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Ewww.

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Alright, so Catherine, have you ever had the chicken pox?

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I did.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have very, very clear memories of when I was a child and I had the chicken pox because I believe it was Thanksgiving and I was about four or five years old.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I didn't have an appetite so I was not hungry and all I could do was itch and drink.

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So I still have little scars like you mentioned from where I couldn't stop myself from scratching my little marks.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Right.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, why does the little boy say that he's going to go take an oatmeal bath?

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay, well, this is one of the home remedies, one of the home cures for the itchiness.

227
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So it doesn't make your chicken pox go away but it does make your skin feel better because it's very calming and smooth.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So you can have some creams or some lotions but other people like to take an oatmeal bath.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Right, so then you're not itching anymore.

230
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Right, but it's gross because you're sitting in oatmeal.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It is kind of gross.

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Have you had the chicken pox?

233
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I did.

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't know but because I couldn't remember so actually my brother had it recently so I was afraid that I didn't get it but called my mom.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
She said I got it so I'm good.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're safe.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, so that's the thing, right?

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You can only get it once.

239
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So once you get it, you don't have a problem.

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, we're curious to know, have you had the chicken pox and if you did, was it really itchy or were you a lucky one and it wasn't so bad?

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So let us know on our website EnglishPod.com.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Right, and if you ever had any other common childhood illnesses like the mumps or the measles, right, you can also tell us about that.

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So we'll see you guys there and until next time.

244
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Bye everyone.
