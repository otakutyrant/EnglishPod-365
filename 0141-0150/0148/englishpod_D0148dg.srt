EnglishPod.com Dan, Dan.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Is everything okay?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Just get over here.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Come in!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Quickly!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, since when is your house a bank?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Security, Dan!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Security!

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You can never be too safe, you know.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A lot of sickos out there.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red-handed.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Had a high-power telescope and binoculars by his window.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What's the matter with you?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why are you acting all paranoid?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Paranoid?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not paranoid!

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm cautious!

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They have way too much information.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, what did you want to see me about?

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're being watched!

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Be careful, Dan.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Be careful.
