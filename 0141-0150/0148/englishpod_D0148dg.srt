EnglishPod.com Dan, Dan.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,619
Dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,339
Is everything okay?

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,140
Just get over here.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,660
Come in!

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,059
Quickly!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,920
So, since when is your house a bank?

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,399
What do you mean?

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,759
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,920
Security, Dan!

11
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:37,640
Security!

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,140
You can never be too safe, you know.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,140
A lot of sickos out there.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red-handed.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,439
Had a high-power telescope and binoculars by his window.

16
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,579
What's the matter with you?

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,520
Why are you acting all paranoid?

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,880
Paranoid?

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,479
I'm not paranoid!

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,439
I'm cautious!

21
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,380
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,099
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,680
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank.

24
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,739
They have way too much information.

25
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:16,780
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

26
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,200
Okay.

27
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,640
Well, what did you want to see me about?

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
You're being watched!

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Be careful, Dan.

30
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:24,599
Be careful.
