00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, we are taking a look at a guy who is a little bit too afraid of people in general.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's a good word for this in English, someone who's almost too afraid all the time, someone who is overly cautious.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We call this person paranoid.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, if you are paranoid, you think that everyone wants to hurt you or that everyone is out to get you.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Did you hear that?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Did you hear that?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, I didn't.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Someone at the door.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Marco, can you check that?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's paranoid.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You know, you're always hearing voices and noises and things.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, a paranoid.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Somebody that is paranoid.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All right.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what this person is all paranoid about.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There he is again.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is everything okay?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just get over here.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Come in.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Quickly.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So, since when is your house a bank?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What do you mean?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Security, Dan.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Security.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can never be too safe, you know.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A lot of sickos out there.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Just the other day, they caught that peeping tom red-handed.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Had a high-powered telescope and binoculars by his window.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's the matter with you?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are you acting all paranoid?

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Paranoid?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not paranoid.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm cautious.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank, they have way too much information.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, what did you want to see me about?

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're being watched.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Be careful, Dan.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Be careful.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
All right, we're back, so yeah, I think this guy is a little bit too cautious.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I would have to agree with you, and I would go so far as to call him paranoid, but there's a lot of great stuff in this dialogue that we can use in a lot of different situations, so let's take a look at some of these new words in today's Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right, the first word on Language Takeaway today is sicko.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sicko is also the name of a movie that was a documentary famous in America by Michael Moore, actually, but sicko in this context means someone who is a bit weird in a bad way.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So if you tell somebody, you're sick, but in that tone, you're saying you're sick.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're a sick person.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're gross.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right, you're saying you're gross.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
People who have inappropriate humor who make jokes about not-so-nice things, they're sick.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But in this case, sickos are people who maybe like to hurt other people or people who are a little bit crazy, people who are not normal.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So it's not a nice way of calling someone crazy, right?

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you say, oh, he's a sicko, it's not really nice.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Not at all.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a way of saying that you're almost scared of this person because they're kind of weird and almost, they have problems.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right, so sicko.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Moving on to our next word, we saw that the guy was afraid of telemarketers.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Exactly.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So what are these guys?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, we've got two words being put together here, tele and market.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So tele, like telephone, telephone over communication.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So they're not in person.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They're people who call you up and market things.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They try to sell you stuff over the phone.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So this is very common.

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You get a phone call on your cell phone and they ask you if you're happy with your long distance calling plan or if you need new TV cable or something like that.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And they always call during dinner or late at night, which drives me nuts.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So these are telemarketers.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
These are people who call you trying to sell things to you.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And very similar to these is solicitors.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But the big difference here with solicitors and telemarketers is that solicitors actually go to your house.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They knock on your door.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So they're also called door to door salesmen or saleswomen.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So door to door salesmen, they go from door to door trying to sell things.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But in this case, a solicitor is someone who comes to your house to try to get you to do something, to buy something.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All right.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Very good.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And moving on to our next word, we have a peeping Tom.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We heard this a little bit earlier in the dialogue and a peeping Tom is again a negative thing to say about someone.

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A peeping Tom, well, the word peep means to look, but kind of like, yeah, it's a quick look.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So peeping Tom is a person who spies on other people.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So a synonym of a peeping Tom would be a voyeur.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A voyeur.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So someone who, um, without getting caught, tries to look at other people while they're in their homes.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so it's really bad because, uh, it's usually inappropriate.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's usually people who are watching women get undressed or, yeah.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So a peeping Tom is just an informal way of saying a voyeur or somebody who is spying on people.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So those are the words for today in language takeaway.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll be right back.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is everything okay?

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Just get over here.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come in quickly.

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So since when is your house a bank?

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What do you mean?

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Security Dan, security.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can never be too safe, you know, a lot of sickos out there.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red handed, had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's the matter with you?

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why are you acting all paranoid?

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Paranoid?

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm not paranoid.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm cautious.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all time.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They have way too much information.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, well, what did you want to see me about?

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're being watched.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Be careful, Dan.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Be careful.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now we're back, and we had some interesting phrases in the dialogue.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The first one being, you can never be too safe.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Fluency builder.

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
All right, so this is a common mom phrase.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You often hear mothers say this when they're sending their kids off to school or whatever.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
They say, don't talk to strangers, and the kid says, well, why not?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can never be too safe.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's good to err on the side of caution.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So it's okay to be extra, extra safe or extra cautious, just in case.

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You never know what's going to happen, so it's better to be cautious than not.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And that's what this person is saying.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's saying, well, security, it's important.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You can never be too safe.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You never know what might happen.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is there another way that we can combine it?

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can never be too careful?

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Exactly.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's basically the same thing.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Same thing, yeah.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All right.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's our next phrase?

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Our next phrase is about this peeping Tom, this person that they caught.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They caught him red-handed.

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We caught you red-handed.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Or he's been caught red-handed.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So what does that mean?

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a very colorful phrase, and I don't just mean that because we're calling him red-handed, but to catch red-handed means to catch someone while they're doing something wrong.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So if I see you breaking into someone's house, and I say, Marco, stop!

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm catching you!

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Stop now!

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I just caught you red-handed.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You saw me doing the act.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Exactly.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And another way of saying this is you caught him with his hand in the cookie jar.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, and this is another great phrase.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can imagine a child who sees the cookies in a very special jar on the counter in the kitchen, and mom says, don't eat the cookies.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, the child goes into the kitchen and sees the cookies and opens the jar and puts his hand in the jar, and then mom comes and says, caught you.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's a boy with his hand or a child with their hand in the cookie jar.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So it's the same thing.

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can say I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar.

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Or you were caught red-handed.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All right, and our last phrase for today is you are on a need-to-know basis.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
All right, this is a great one.

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is often said in spy movies, I think.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So we say you're on a need-to-know basis.

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That means that if you really need to know something, then I will tell you.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But if not, I won't.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you only have the information that is necessary.

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No more or less, right?

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're on a need-to-know basis.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right, so I say, tell me, Marco, tell me what happened.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I want to know.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right, and I can say, no, no, you're on a need-to-know basis and you don't need to know this.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
All right, so a need-to-know basis, as you say, very popular among spy movies and government movies and stuff like that.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Conspiracy movies.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
All right, so let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time, and we'll be right back.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Van.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Van.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is everything okay?

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Just get over here.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Come in.

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Quickly.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So, since when is your house a bank?

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What do you mean?

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Security, Dan.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Security.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can never be too safe, you know.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A lot of sickos out there.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Just the other day, they caught that heaping Tom, red-handed, had a high-power telescope and binoculars by his window.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What's the matter with you?

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why are you acting all paranoid?

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Paranoid?

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm not paranoid!

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm cautious!

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank, they have way too much information.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Well, what did you want to see me about?

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're being watched!

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Be careful, Dan.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Be careful.

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
All right, so the guy's a little bit paranoid.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
There's another word for this as well.

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Similar, right?

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A schizo?

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Schizophrenia is a disease, and a lot of people have it and it's not too uncommon, but a popular slang word to say someone's crazy is schizo.

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So if you guys remember this movie, A Beautiful Mind, it's all about this famous mathematician named John Nash, and well, he was a genius.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He came up with game theory and a lot of subsequent usage of this for economy, for many things.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But it was proven that he was schizophrenic, right?

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
A paranoid schizophrenic.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So not only did he kind of have experienced reality in different ways, but he's also paranoid.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So he was afraid that the government was trying to kill him.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And so he was irrationally afraid of everything going on around him and it made him very unsafe because he could hurt himself or hurt other people.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And the interesting thing about this is that there is no actual cure for it.

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You just learn to cope and live with it, so you never really get cured, you just kind of live with it.

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Learn how to understand what's real and what's not.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So it's interesting.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a great movie also, by the way, if you've never seen it or you get a chance to watch it.

230
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And that's all the time we have for today.
