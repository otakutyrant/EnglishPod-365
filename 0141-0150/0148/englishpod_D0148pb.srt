00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:08,039
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,140
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,160
So, Marco, what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:18,100
Today, we are taking a look at a guy who is a little bit too afraid of people in general.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,300
There's a good word for this in English, someone who's almost too afraid all the time, someone who is overly cautious.

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,280
We call this person paranoid.

8
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:26,879
Okay.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:34,420
So, if you are paranoid, you think that everyone wants to hurt you or that everyone is out to get you.

10
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:35,460
Did you hear that?

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,280
No.

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,299
Did you hear that?

13
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:37,719
No, I didn't.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,380
Someone at the door.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,979
Marco, can you check that?

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:41,299
Okay.

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:41,840
That's paranoid.

18
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,119
You know, you're always hearing voices and noises and things.

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,600
So, a paranoid.

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,020
Somebody that is paranoid.

21
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:48,679
All right.

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,100
So, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what this person is all paranoid about.

23
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:54,920
There he is again.

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,920
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,340
Is everything okay?

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,159
Just get over here.

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,640
Come in.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,060
Quickly.

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,900
So, since when is your house a bank?

30
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,340
What do you mean?

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,760
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

32
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,900
Security, Dan.

33
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,640
Security.

34
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:36,140
You can never be too safe, you know.

35
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,099
A lot of sickos out there.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,040
Just the other day, they caught that peeping tom red-handed.

37
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,420
Had a high-powered telescope and binoculars by his window.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,519
What's the matter with you?

39
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,500
Why are you acting all paranoid?

40
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,840
Paranoid?

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,480
I'm not paranoid.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,439
I'm cautious.

43
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,359
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

44
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,099
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

45
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:08,719
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank, they have way too much information.

46
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,740
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

47
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,180
Okay.

48
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,620
Well, what did you want to see me about?

49
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:17,919
You're being watched.

50
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,219
Be careful, Dan.

51
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,560
Be careful.

52
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,080
All right, we're back, so yeah, I think this guy is a little bit too cautious.

53
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:46,400
I would have to agree with you, and I would go so far as to call him paranoid, but there's a lot of great stuff in this dialogue that we can use in a lot of different situations, so let's take a look at some of these new words in today's Language Takeaway.

54
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,240
Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,400
All right, the first word on Language Takeaway today is sicko.

56
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:05,300
Sicko is also the name of a movie that was a documentary famous in America by Michael Moore, actually, but sicko in this context means someone who is a bit weird in a bad way.

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,620
So if you tell somebody, you're sick, but in that tone, you're saying you're sick.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,719
You're a sick person.

59
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,639
You're gross.

60
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
Right, you're saying you're gross.

61
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:20,379
People who have inappropriate humor who make jokes about not-so-nice things, they're sick.

62
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:29,259
But in this case, sickos are people who maybe like to hurt other people or people who are a little bit crazy, people who are not normal.

63
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,340
So it's not a nice way of calling someone crazy, right?

64
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,840
If you say, oh, he's a sicko, it's not really nice.

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,460
Not at all.

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,240
It's a way of saying that you're almost scared of this person because they're kind of weird and almost, they have problems.

67
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,979
All right, so sicko.

68
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:48,460
Moving on to our next word, we saw that the guy was afraid of telemarketers.

69
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,139
Exactly.

70
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,180
So what are these guys?

71
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,539
Well, we've got two words being put together here, tele and market.

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,599
So tele, like telephone, telephone over communication.

73
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,759
So they're not in person.

74
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,979
They're people who call you up and market things.

75
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,280
They try to sell you stuff over the phone.

76
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:05,539
So this is very common.

77
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:14,659
You get a phone call on your cell phone and they ask you if you're happy with your long distance calling plan or if you need new TV cable or something like that.

78
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:18,800
And they always call during dinner or late at night, which drives me nuts.

79
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:20,939
So these are telemarketers.

80
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,680
These are people who call you trying to sell things to you.

81
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,379
And very similar to these is solicitors.

82
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,839
But the big difference here with solicitors and telemarketers is that solicitors actually go to your house.

83
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:34,939
They knock on your door.

84
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,680
So they're also called door to door salesmen or saleswomen.

85
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,339
That's right.

86
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,899
So door to door salesmen, they go from door to door trying to sell things.

87
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:48,379
But in this case, a solicitor is someone who comes to your house to try to get you to do something, to buy something.

88
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:49,240
All right.

89
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:49,699
Very good.

90
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,740
And moving on to our next word, we have a peeping Tom.

91
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:54,579
That's right.

92
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,939
We heard this a little bit earlier in the dialogue and a peeping Tom is again a negative thing to say about someone.

93
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,060
A peeping Tom, well, the word peep means to look, but kind of like, yeah, it's a quick look.

94
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,420
So peeping Tom is a person who spies on other people.

95
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,040
Okay.

96
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,600
So a synonym of a peeping Tom would be a voyeur.

97
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,540
A voyeur.

98
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,860
So someone who, um, without getting caught, tries to look at other people while they're in their homes.

99
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,939
And so it's really bad because, uh, it's usually inappropriate.

100
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,279
It's usually people who are watching women get undressed or, yeah.

101
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,660
So a peeping Tom is just an informal way of saying a voyeur or somebody who is spying on people.

102
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,379
So those are the words for today in language takeaway.

103
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,079
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll be right back.

104
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,899
Dan, Dan, dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,680
Is everything okay?

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,480
Just get over here.

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,740
Come in quickly.

108
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,879
So since when is your house a bank?

109
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,379
What do you mean?

110
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,720
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

111
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,579
Security Dan, security.

112
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,160
You can never be too safe, you know, a lot of sickos out there.

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:25,379
Just the other day, they caught that peeping Tom red handed, had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window.

114
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,500
What's the matter with you?

115
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,480
Why are you acting all paranoid?

116
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,839
Paranoid?

117
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,439
I'm not paranoid.

118
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,439
I'm cautious.

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,339
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all time.

120
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:44,639
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank.

121
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,680
They have way too much information.

122
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,740
I like to keep everything on a need to know basis.

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,620
Okay, well, what did you want to see me about?

124
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,879
You're being watched.

125
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,160
Be careful, Dan.

126
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,540
Be careful.

127
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,300
Now we're back, and we had some interesting phrases in the dialogue.

128
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,920
The first one being, you can never be too safe.

129
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:12,120
Fluency builder.

130
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
All right, so this is a common mom phrase.

131
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:19,019
You often hear mothers say this when they're sending their kids off to school or whatever.

132
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,360
They say, don't talk to strangers, and the kid says, well, why not?

133
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,079
You can never be too safe.

134
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,000
It's good to err on the side of caution.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,180
So it's okay to be extra, extra safe or extra cautious, just in case.

136
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,079
You never know what's going to happen, so it's better to be cautious than not.

137
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
And that's what this person is saying.

138
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:42,720
He's saying, well, security, it's important.

139
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,100
You can never be too safe.

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,939
You never know what might happen.

141
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,120
Is there another way that we can combine it?

142
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,939
You can never be too careful?

143
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:50,920
Exactly.

144
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,199
It's basically the same thing.

145
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,060
Same thing, yeah.

146
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:53,579
All right.

147
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,579
What's our next phrase?

148
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:59,420
Our next phrase is about this peeping Tom, this person that they caught.

149
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,779
They caught him red-handed.

150
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:03,540
We caught you red-handed.

151
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,180
Or he's been caught red-handed.

152
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,899
So what does that mean?

153
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:18,220
It's a very colorful phrase, and I don't just mean that because we're calling him red-handed, but to catch red-handed means to catch someone while they're doing something wrong.

154
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:24,420
So if I see you breaking into someone's house, and I say, Marco, stop!

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,439
I'm catching you!

156
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,160
Stop now!

157
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,899
I just caught you red-handed.

158
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,240
You saw me doing the act.

159
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,120
Exactly.

160
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,500
And another way of saying this is you caught him with his hand in the cookie jar.

161
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay, and this is another great phrase.

162
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:45,419
You can imagine a child who sees the cookies in a very special jar on the counter in the kitchen, and mom says, don't eat the cookies.

163
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:51,879
Well, the child goes into the kitchen and sees the cookies and opens the jar and puts his hand in the jar, and then mom comes and says, caught you.

164
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:54,960
That's a boy with his hand or a child with their hand in the cookie jar.

165
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,080
So it's the same thing.

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,059
I can say I caught you with your hand in the cookie jar.

167
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,580
Or you were caught red-handed.

168
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,360
All right, and our last phrase for today is you are on a need-to-know basis.

169
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,679
All right, this is a great one.

170
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,379
This is often said in spy movies, I think.

171
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,320
So we say you're on a need-to-know basis.

172
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,200
That means that if you really need to know something, then I will tell you.

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,039
But if not, I won't.

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
So you only have the information that is necessary.

175
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,940
No more or less, right?

176
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,480
You're on a need-to-know basis.

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,840
Right, so I say, tell me, Marco, tell me what happened.

178
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,700
I want to know.

179
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,320
Right, and I can say, no, no, you're on a need-to-know basis and you don't need to know this.

180
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:41,220
All right, so a need-to-know basis, as you say, very popular among spy movies and government movies and stuff like that.

181
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:41,860
Conspiracy movies.

182
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,120
Yeah.

183
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,279
All right, so let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time, and we'll be right back.

184
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:55,620
Van.

185
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,860
Van.

186
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,360
Dude, you have to come over to my house right now.

187
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,059
Is everything okay?

188
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,659
Just get over here.

189
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Come in.

190
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:14,779
Quickly.

191
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,639
So, since when is your house a bank?

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,080
What do you mean?

193
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:24,440
I mean, what's up with the four locks and iron bars on your windows?

194
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,639
Security, Dan.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,399
Security.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,879
You can never be too safe, you know.

197
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
A lot of sickos out there.

198
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:39,179
Just the other day, they caught that heaping Tom, red-handed, had a high-power telescope and binoculars by his window.

199
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,279
What's the matter with you?

200
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,259
Why are you acting all paranoid?

201
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:44,620
Paranoid?

202
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,240
I'm not paranoid!

203
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,179
I'm cautious!

204
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,120
You see, Dan, we have to be on guard at all times.

205
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,799
People just invade your privacy as if they knew you.

206
00:10:55,659 --> 00:11:01,480
Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank, they have way too much information.

207
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,539
I like to keep everything on a need-to-know basis.

208
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:06,899
Okay.

209
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,379
Well, what did you want to see me about?

210
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,700
You're being watched!

211
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,960
Be careful, Dan.

212
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,340
Be careful.

213
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,039
All right, so the guy's a little bit paranoid.

214
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,559
There's another word for this as well.

215
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,340
Similar, right?

216
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,039
A schizo?

217
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:37,500
Schizophrenia is a disease, and a lot of people have it and it's not too uncommon, but a popular slang word to say someone's crazy is schizo.

218
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:46,379
So if you guys remember this movie, A Beautiful Mind, it's all about this famous mathematician named John Nash, and well, he was a genius.

219
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,700
He came up with game theory and a lot of subsequent usage of this for economy, for many things.

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,240
But it was proven that he was schizophrenic, right?

221
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:56,460
A paranoid schizophrenic.

222
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:03,179
So not only did he kind of have experienced reality in different ways, but he's also paranoid.

223
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,240
So he was afraid that the government was trying to kill him.

224
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:16,600
And so he was irrationally afraid of everything going on around him and it made him very unsafe because he could hurt himself or hurt other people.

225
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:21,960
And the interesting thing about this is that there is no actual cure for it.

226
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:28,320
You just learn to cope and live with it, so you never really get cured, you just kind of live with it.

227
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,360
Learn how to understand what's real and what's not.

228
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,659
So it's interesting.

229
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,259
It's a great movie also, by the way, if you've never seen it or you get a chance to watch it.

230
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,360
And that's all the time we have for today.
