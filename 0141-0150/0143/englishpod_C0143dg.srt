EnglishPod.com Hi, what can I get for you?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'd like half a pound of ground beef, please.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good choice.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, no, no.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Chicken breasts at the moment.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But we have some nice chicken thighs.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No, that won't do.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, is there anything else?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Is this salami and bologna you have here?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's very fine meat.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Made it myself.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sounds good.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Okay, that's it.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait, we have t-bone, ribeye, and sirloin sticks.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They are very fresh.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Just came from the slaughterhouse.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, that's okay, really.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I think that's all for today.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, that'll be $34.50.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thanks for watching.
