EnglishPod.com Hi, what can I get for you?

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,240
I'd like half a pound of ground beef, please.

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:15,800
Good choice.

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,199
Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,660
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,120
No, no, no.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,179
Chicken breasts at the moment.

8
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,560
But we have some nice chicken thighs.

9
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,500
No, that won't do.

10
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,780
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

11
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:43,579
Okay, is there anything else?

12
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,020
Is this salami and bologna you have here?

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,380
Yes.

14
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:51,399
It's very fine meat.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,060
Made it myself.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,759
Sounds good.

17
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,960
Okay, that's it.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,780
Wait, we have t-bone, ribeye, and sirloin sticks.

19
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:03,780
They are very fresh.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,359
Just came from the slaughterhouse.

21
00:01:07,179 --> 00:01:10,120
No, that's okay, really.

22
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:11,459
I think that's all for today.

23
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,719
Okay, that'll be $34.50.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,120
Thanks for watching.
