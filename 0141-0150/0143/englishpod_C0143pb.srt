00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're going to be visiting one of my favorite places, I must say.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So you're a big meat eater.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I have to have meat every day, so that's why I usually go to the butcher.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
All right, so vegetarians, be warned, today's dialogue is all about eating meat and where to go to get meat.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So as Marco said, that place is called The Butcher's.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we're going to be visiting The Butcher, and we're going to learn all the different types of meat you can find there.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Great.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we don't have anything to preview, but before we get started, I'd just like to mention that you're going to hear a lot of different kinds of words, and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what they mean.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi, what can I get for you?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'd like half a pound of ground beef, please.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good choice.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, no, no chicken breasts at the moment.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But we have some nice chicken thighs.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, that won't do.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, is there anything else?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is this salami and bologna you have here?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, it's very fine meat.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Made it myself.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sounds good.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, that's it.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait, we have t-bone, ribeye, and sirloin sticks.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They are very fresh.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Just came from the slaughterhouse.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mmm, no, that's okay, really.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think that's all for today.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, that'll be $34.50.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Alright, we're back.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So this butcher was kind of creepy in the beginning.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Very creepy in the beginning.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think that's usually the conception that you have of butchers because they always have a knife and they're always covered in blood, but it's not human blood.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right, like the movie Sweeney Todd.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Did you see that?

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yeah, like Sweeney Todd.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The butcher of Fleet Street.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But we actually took a look at a lot of different types of meat that the woman was ordering.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So why don't we take a look at these now in Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, so the first is a classic cut.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is something that we had at my house about once a week growing up.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's called a pork chop.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Pork chop.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So a pork chop comes from the animal, the pork or pig.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, we actually don't say pork to mean the animal.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Pork just means the kind of meat that comes from a pig.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So big difference there when we're talking about food.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We say pork.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, wow.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And what about a pork chop?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So what exactly is that?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Chop is usually just on the bone and oftentimes it's fried or baked, I guess.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But it's just a piece of pork on the bone and a chop, you just imagine a knife chopping something.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Alright, so a pork chop, very good.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And after pork chops, we were ordering some ground beef.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Alright, so ground beef is another important one.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Ground beef is beef that's been chopped up and pushed through a machine that kind of pushes it out in very, very small bits and pieces.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's no bones.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So ground comes from the verb to grind.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So to grind up meat, to make it very, very small pieces.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Right, so if you want to make a spaghetti bolognese, the kind of beef you use is ground beef or even hamburgers.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, yeah, exactly.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So ground beef, you ground up beef.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What other things would you grind?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You could grind your teeth.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Some people do that when they're sleeping, they grind their teeth.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You can grind, you have pepper grinders, you know, peppers sometimes come in balls and you have to grind them to make them smaller and broken down.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Very good.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So that's ground beef and from the verb to grind.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now we are buying some boneless chicken breasts.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Alright, so boneless, as you have guessed, means without bones and chicken breasts are usually just really nice, juicy, kind of tender cut of meat from the chicken from the underside of the chicken where obviously, yeah, they have it.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not a wing.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not a leg.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's just a chicken breast.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Alright, so boneless chicken breast, now usually it is boneless, right, when you buy it at the supermarket.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Next up, we've got some classic deli counter favorites.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
These are our cold cuts.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Alright, so cold cuts, now this means that they are cold.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh, well, yeah, they're cold, but I think cold cuts, the most important thing to remember here is that they're mostly like kinds of salami or cured meats.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So these are salt cured or they're dried meats and you usually have them on sandwiches, so like a salami sandwich.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So like cured meat, you mean that meat, it hasn't been cooked.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, no, it's not been cooked, but it's treated in a way that allows it to last for a very long time.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Alright, so.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So they look like long, long tubes of meat.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They look very dry.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They look very dry like beef jerky, for example.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Alright, so cured meat.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, for example, we have salami and bologna.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Bologna.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, it's interesting because bologna is actually spelled B-O-L-O-G-N-A, so you say bologna, bologna or something like that.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, I think it comes from the Italian bologna.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But it's definitely a change that happened in the English language when it came over from Italy, but bologna is a kind of meat that's got, yeah, it's got a very funny looking name.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, see, you're more sophisticated than I am.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's why you know this difference.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I just speak Italian, so no.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Alright, so you have salami, bologna, and pastrami.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What about ham?

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is that considered a cold cut?

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can have ham in the cold cut section because ham sometimes comes in tubes that you slice, but ham is also just a normal kind of pork, but ham is cured, you know.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Like smoked ham.

108
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Exactly.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Or smoked turkey, one of my favorites.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Very good.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And well, now moving on from the cold cuts, we're going to concentrate on steaks.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ooh, steaks.

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So there are a thousand kinds of steaks in this world and every city seems to have its own kind, but here we're only looking at three, the first of which is the t-bone.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Alright, the t-bone steak I think is one of the most popular ones.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a steak that's pretty big, right?

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, well, yeah, it can be.

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And it has a bone inside that looks like a T.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Alright, so you're saying, Marco, that the t-bone is named after the shape and the look of this steak.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, t-bone steak.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Alright.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And as well as our next one is also a rib eye.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, so the rib eye I think actually has a piece of the rib in it.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So the rib is the bone and there's a circle, which is kind of a, it's, the piece of meat is sliced off the rib and the circle is actually part of that rib, so there's a little bit of bone in it, but it's not as bony as the t-bone.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Right, so it does have one small bone that kind of looks like an eye because you can see through it.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And our next steak has no bone and is the most tender and the best steak you can have, sirloin steak.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So I think the sirloin is definitely the most expensive if you're in a restaurant.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Definitely the most tender, I think, of all those kind of cuts.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And usually you can have like a big sirloin steak, like a half a kilo, like a 400 gram sirloin steak.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I had a friend who ate a full kilo sirloin steak.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wow, is it a competition or?

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, there's a kind of steak called Bisteca a la Fiorentina in Italy.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's the Florentine beef steak and it is, it can be about a kilo of meat.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah.

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I bet you can't even move after that.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, you fall asleep with your head in your soup on the table.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
All right, so that's all the meat related words that we have for you today.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder where we're going to take a look at some of the phrases in this dialogue.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We're going to look at the phrases, if you know what I mean.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you know what I mean.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now I love this phrase, if you know what I mean.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I do know what you mean.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, it's great.

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I like it too.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So you can use it for sarcasm.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right?

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Or you can use it to kind of insinuate something, right?

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Exactly.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So here's what you're saying.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're saying there's a double meaning in what I want to say.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So there's two things I could say, and I'm not going to say it outright, but you know, this thing that we can't really say.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So for example, we can say she likes to go out, if you know what I mean.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
All right, so you're insinuating that not only does she like to go out, but maybe she goes out a lot.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A lot.

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Or maybe she gets drunk or something like that.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So it's kind of like a double meaning, but you're trying to be subtle.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, but it's not so subtle because you're actually saying like, this is not what I mean.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Or she's eating for two, if you know what I mean.

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, there we go.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So you're insinuating that, well, you're not really insinuating.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You're telling me that.

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
She's pregnant.

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Eating for two is a common idiom in English that means that a person, a woman, is going to have a baby.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So here I'm saying, hey, do you know this idiom?

167
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She's eating for two, if you know what I mean.

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wink, wink, wink.

169
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Wink, wink.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So now why don't we take a look at some other examples of how we could use if you know what I mean in different circumstances when you're trying to insinuate something.

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Example one.

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
She's eating for two now, if you know what I mean.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Example two.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Tim hit a home run today, if you know what I mean.

175
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Example three.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Jim and Laura are going their separate ways, if you know what I mean.

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
All right, we're back.

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So now that that's clear, why don't we move on to our next phrase?

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So this one is a counting phrase.

180
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And for those of you who have heard the word dozen before, it might not be so new.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The phrase is half a dozen.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Half a dozen.

183
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So that means half of 12.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So a dozen is 12.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And it's, I'm not really sure when this started being used in English, but a dozen is 12.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And half a dozen is then six.

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now there's another phrase or another saying that's very common.

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
A dime a dozen.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He's a dime a dozen.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So that means you can get 12 of the same type of guys for 10 cents.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right, so they're easy to find.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They're easy to find.

193
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The dime a dozen.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
All right, very good.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And moving on to our last one.

196
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
When they were talking, they said something about the meat being lean, extra lean.

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, lean, this does not mean lean on a door.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This is not like resting on something.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is actually a kind of way to describe food.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And so food is lean if it's not got much fat.

201
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's not fatty.

202
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, so if it's lean, it doesn't have much fat.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Exactly.

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So I prefer to eat lean meats.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So I often eat birds and poultry.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So chicken, I like it pretty lean.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And if it's got fat on it, I'll cut the fat off.

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, like the skin.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The skin is fat, right?

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
All right, so you can have lean beef.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It doesn't have much fat around it.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, and in America, actually, on the packages at the supermarket, it often says the percentage of meat that you have, so it's 95% lean or 98% lean.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So that means you have 3% fat in there.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Or 2%.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
My math skills are amazing.

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All right, so now that we've finished with all of these words on Fluency Builder, let's take a look at our dialogue for the last time.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hi, what can I get for you?

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'd like half pound of ground beef, please.

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Good choice.

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.

222
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breast?

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, no, no chicken breasts at the moment.

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But we have some nice chicken thighs.

225
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
No, that won't do.

226
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll take this smoked ham you have here.

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay, is there anything else?

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Is this salami and bologna you have here?

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, it's very fine meat.

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Made it myself.

231
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Sounds good.

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Okay, that's it.

233
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Wait, we have t-bone, ribeye, and sirloin steaks.

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They are very fresh.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Just came from the slaughterhouse.

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, that's okay, really.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I think that's all for today.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Okay, that'll be $34.50.

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
All right, we're back.

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So, Catherine, are you a big beef or meat eater?

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Definitely am.

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It helps that my partner in crime is from Kansas City.

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And they have the best, among the best steaks in our entire country in Kansas City.

244
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Wow.

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I actually miss, there was back in California, we had the $6 burger from Carl's Jr.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was just basically beef, bacon, cheese.

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It was just like this huge burger with full of meat and obviously a lot of calories.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, yeah.

249
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But it was delicious.

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
In Ecuador, we are very used to having some meat product every day with our food.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, well, it's the same in the Midwest, actually, from where we're from.

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's the same in the Midwest because people in the Midwest generally think that if you're not eating meat, then what are you eating?

253
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Bread?

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Right.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So, meat is considered a healthy part of the day and you definitely eat it with your meals.

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, and I'm sure our vegetarian listeners might not appreciate this, but it's just kind of different diets.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Some people eat, for example, rice every day.

258
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So, where in other countries you wouldn't really have rice every day.

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Or, for example, when I was in Chile, I had a lot of potatoes.

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Really?

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A lot of potatoes.

262
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Have you ever had an Argentine steak?

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I hear they have the best beef in the world.

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
They are not only delicious, but they are very inexpensive and it's amazing.

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You can have a complete steak buffet for like, I don't know, I can't even remember, but I sat there for three hours and couldn't move and kept eating.

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Is it true you can eat it with a spoon?

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's so soft.

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Some of the meat is very, very tender.

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Not if it's grilled, you can't really do that, but in other preparations it's almost like that.

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
With a nice butter sauce.

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Herbs.

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
All right.

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Making me hungry.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I know, you've made me hungry.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think we're going to take off and have some burgers.

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:41,000

Bye.

280
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Bye.
