00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:07,059
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another edition here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,759
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,220
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,880
And today we've got a great upper intermediate level lesson for you all about animal and human rights.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,359
So it's a very debatable topic.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,160
People want to protect animals, mistreatment of animals.

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,780
And this is what we're going to talk about today, protecting animals and giving them rights.

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,320
Do you think animals have rights?

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,620
Eh, well, you know, I think we could leave that for the end.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,140
I don't want to, you know, influence the argument here in today's dialogue.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,560
But yeah, as you've said, I think it's very much a topic that people can go both ways on.

12
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:47,679
So why don't we listen to our dialogue as two people discuss animal rights and let's get their opinions on things.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,679
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,979
The topic it covered was really interesting.

15
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,000
Animal rights.

16
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,780
Do you really believe in that?

17
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,359
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

18
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:13,099
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

19
00:01:13,099 --> 00:01:17,379
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,159
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,480
You can't compare apples and oranges.

22
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:30,939
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,459
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,000
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

25
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,379
Well, you are right on that point.

26
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:44,459
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

27
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,239
At least you're doing your part.

28
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,359
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

29
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:53,140
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.

30
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,500
All right, we're back and both of them have good points, right?

31
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,200
In favor and against and as you said, they also talk about human rights, which is also a very important topic.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,500
But before we discuss this topic, why don't we take a look at the language that was used now in Language Takeaway.

33
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,199
All right, so in Language Takeaway, our first word today is vulnerable.

34
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,400
Okay, vulnerable is a great word.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,819
It's a way to describe something and so something is vulnerable if it can't really protect itself.

36
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,819
So you are in danger of being hurt.

37
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:31,300
Exactly.

38
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,139
Right, so you're vulnerable.

39
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,379
Now, this isn't only used for animals, right?

40
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:42,680
It can be like an army is vulnerable if they don't have strong defenses on the border or something.

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
Or my emotions.

42
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:51,620
I'm feeling vulnerable because I just had a really horrible week and I'm really depressed and I'm emotionally vulnerable.

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,800
Okay, very good.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,099
So vulnerable.

45
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,979
And they also talked about transgressions against human rights.

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,860
All right, so a transgression is a thing.

47
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,479
It's a noun.

48
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,060
And transgression is like doing something harmful to or against someone or something.

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,840
So a transgression, it's a noun.

50
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,219
So is it doing something in a bad way?

51
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:13,800
Exactly.

52
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,759
It's a bad thing.

53
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,500
It's always negative.

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,020
It's not positive, right?

55
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:17,379
Right.

56
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:26,740
And so in many prayers, for example, in the Christian faith, you say, you know, Lord, forgive me for my transgressions for having kind of crossed the line from doing good things to bad things.

57
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,620
So you're doing bad things.

58
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,159
Very good.

59
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,780
And so that's a good way of putting it, to cross the line, to kind of go beyond where you should.

60
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:33,599
All right.

61
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,740
So transgressions.

62
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,099
And now another very serious problem in the world is poaching.

63
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,159
That's one of the things that they said they should control, poaching.

64
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:55,060
You might have heard this word in a different context because it does have another meaning, but I'm just going to explain the one meaning here that we're talking about, which is killing animals, especially for sport or for selling their skins and their furs.

65
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,580
Right.

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,819
So that's poaching.

67
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,860
What's the difference between poaching and hunting?

68
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,259
Hunting can be legal.

69
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,139
Poaching is illegal.

70
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:02,639
Okay.

71
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,879
So that's the main difference.

72
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,599
Hunting is usually for sport.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,400
You hunt either for food or for sport, right?

74
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:09,419
Legal hunting.

75
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:16,279
But poaching is usually you want to sell, like you said, the fur or the skins or the tusks on rhinos or something like that.

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,300
All right.

77
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,060
So poaching.

78
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,639
And then they talked about synthetic products.

79
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,139
So what is what is a synthetic product?

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,579
Well, synthetic product is something that is manmade.

81
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,379
So it's not natural in that it doesn't come from the earth.

82
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,220
Cotton is a natural product.

83
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,480
And plastic, for example, is synthetic or another example, nylon.

84
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:39,339
Nylon is a really good synthetic product.

85
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:46,920
And so people who don't want to use animal products like wool or leather, they prefer to use synthetic products.

86
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,199
And I think maybe you've heard this in clothing.

87
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,920
It's called synthetic fibers, right?

88
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,500
Like nylon or polyester.

89
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:54,060
Exactly.

90
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,980
These are all the words that we have for language takeaway today.

91
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,639
So why don't we move on now to a couple of very interesting phrases that we saw in the dialogue now in Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:13,759
OK, this first phrase is well, it's a common one, but it's definitely not used in very happy circumstances.

93
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:18,199
We say that something or someone is at the mercy of someone else.

94
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,920
OK, so animals are at the mercy of human beings.

95
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,319
What does this mean exactly?

96
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,120
So basically it means that the animals in this case are don't have control of what's going on.

97
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,540
So human beings are the ones that control everything.

98
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:40,279
So if I decide to to to kill them, then they are at my mercy, at my will, at my whim.

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,120
Exactly.

100
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,500
And so you could say, I'm at your mercy, Marco, please just like help me out with this.

101
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,899
It's like you're the one in control.

102
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:48,899
You're the one who can help the situation.

103
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,879
Will you help?

104
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:50,800
Exactly.

105
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,860
I'm at the mercy of someone.

106
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,360
And then they were talking and debating this thing.

107
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,800
And an interesting comparison came up.

108
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,899
You can't compare apples and oranges.

109
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:02,379
All right.

110
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:03,759
You're going to hear this all the time in English.

111
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,300
It's it's not just a funny little phrase that the person uses.

112
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,600
It's a very common idiom.

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,079
And so we say it's like apples and oranges or you can't compare apples and oranges.

114
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:20,040
And this is essentially saying these are two different things, completely different, completely different.

115
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,120
So I can't compare him and her because it's apples and oranges.

116
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,000
They're two different things, two different people.

117
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,759
Because that's what in the movie you said they were like peas and carrots.

118
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,379
Just go together.

119
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,000
Go together.

120
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,339
Does that make sense?

121
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,199
Not really.

122
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,220
Forrest Gump was a little bit strange like that.

123
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:41,139
But I think the meaning is that if I say that's a big apple and I say that's a small apple, they're all apples.

124
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,519
So I can compare compare them.

125
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,300
But I say this is a really big orange and that's a really big apple.

126
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, they're they're different.

127
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,959
You just you just can't compare them.

128
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,180
All right.

129
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:55,279
And and towards the end, the person said that you're doing your part.

130
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,120
You're doing your part.

131
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,339
Yeah.

132
00:06:57,339 --> 00:07:02,439
So this is this is a hard one to understand sometimes because it's not like a part in a play.

133
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:04,079
It's more like a part in society.

134
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,759
You're helping make society or culture or civilization better.

135
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,180
So you're contributing.

136
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:10,959
Exactly.

137
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,139
So, for example, what.

138
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,439
So what would be an example of a person doing their part towards society?

139
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,060
Well, for example, I don't own a car.

140
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,279
I ride my bike and it's my way of doing my part to help the environment.

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,339
OK, very good.

142
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:32,560
Because I can't obviously I can't buy a factory that's, you know, very green or I can't do all these things to change the world.

143
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,240
So I'm going to do small things that that those are my way of doing my part.

144
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:36,699
OK.

145
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,160
So like another example would be recycling.

146
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:40,240
That's doing your part.

147
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,560
Exactly.

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,000
Or in this case, the person bought only synthetic products, nothing made from nature.

149
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,259
All right.

150
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:48,680
Very good.

151
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,379
So very interesting phrases.

152
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,680
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll be right back.

153
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,980
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

154
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:07,259
The topic it covered was really interesting.

155
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,300
Animal rights.

156
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,060
Do you really believe in that?

157
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,660
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

158
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,379
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,680
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,419
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,759
You can't compare apples and oranges.

162
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,240
I believe that both topics are important and that we can't ignore them.

163
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,720
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

164
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,259
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

165
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,659
Well, you are right on that point.

166
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:51,720
This is the reason that I don't buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.

167
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,519
At least you're doing your part.

168
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,639
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,379
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,200
All right, so a debatable topic, animals and animal rights.

171
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,519
What do you think?

172
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,279
Well, I'll say this.

173
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,259
I would be a hypocrite if I said that it's bad to hurt animals because I'm a meat eater.

174
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,100
I like to eat meat and I like to wear leather, but I do think it's bad to mistreat animals.

175
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,559
So I really, I try to buy, you know, free range chicken or meat from places I know that treat the animals well.

176
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:39,700
And I definitely disagree with poaching and with using animals, especially endangered animals, for money and cash purposes.

177
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,340
And so that's my position.

178
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,360
But what's yours?

179
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,000
I mean, I know you eat eat meat, too.

180
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,080
No, yeah, of course.

181
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:57,759
And I think even though protection of animals is a very important topic and you don't want the mistreatment of these little creatures that are very vulnerable to us because we're smarter than them in the end.

182
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:05,840
But I think also it has to do a lot with superstition sometimes and kind of mystical and magical things.

183
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:16,279
For example, people killing rhinos because they believe that the rhino horn has amazing curing properties or, you know, or the same thing with elephant tusks and stuff like that.

184
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,720
So it also it involves this certain aspect that people almost don't know any better.

185
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,620
They just they truly believe that these things actually work or that they will help them.

186
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,799
So they don't consider the the like in the dialogue said that the imbalance that they create in the environment or the consequences.

187
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,679
Or there might be some very serious evolutionary consequences that we can not even imagine.

188
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:43,000
And so, you know, things things change kind of over time, sometimes quickly and sometimes slowly.

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,559
But if we force change really quickly, who knows what the results are going to be?

190
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,960
It might be really negative for us.

191
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:49,700
Exactly.

192
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,000
And that's what we want to know now.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,919
What do you think about these topics?

194
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,840
Because in the end, the environment, animals, they're all connected.

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:05,580
If you wipe out all the foxes in a forest and you're going to have like you're going to have too many snakes running around.

196
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,340
