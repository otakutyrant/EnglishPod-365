00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,419
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,720
The topic it covered was really interesting.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:12,759
Animal rights.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,539
Do you really believe in that?

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,100
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:24,859
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

7
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,140
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,899
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,240
You can't compare apples and oranges.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,700
I believe that both topics are important, and that we can't ignore them.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,179
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,740
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,119
Well, you are right on that point.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,219
This is the reason that I don't buy leather, and I try to buy synthetic products.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,979
At least you're doing your part.

16
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:02,140
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

17
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,859
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.
