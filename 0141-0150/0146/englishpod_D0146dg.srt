1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You should have seen the TV show that was on last night.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The topic it covered was really interesting.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Animal rights.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you really believe in that?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If they're going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, but we can't deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If so much attention weren't devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can't compare apples and oranges.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I believe that both topics are important, and that we can't ignore them.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, you are right on that point.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is the reason that I don't buy leather, and I try to buy synthetic products.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
At least you're doing your part.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As long as you don't treat it better than your wife, it's fine.
