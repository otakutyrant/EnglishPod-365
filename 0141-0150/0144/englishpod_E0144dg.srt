EnglishPod.com That's all for today's class.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,859
We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,059
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,379
Well, it depends on what you mean.

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:30,079
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offenses, and lock up juvenile offenders.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,060
Those sound like really draconian measures.

7
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,359
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?

8
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,640
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right person.

9
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:48,380
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,859
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

11
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,359
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,040
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,620
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,959
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to be caught.

15
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:16,920
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,840
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,239
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

18
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,400
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,140
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

20
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,219
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

21
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

22
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,920
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

23
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,780
You sound like a dictator.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,680
Well, if it works, why not?
