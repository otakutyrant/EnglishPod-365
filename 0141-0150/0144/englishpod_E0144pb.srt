Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,360
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:09,500
And my name is Katherine, and today we're talking about something very serious.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,640
Very serious.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,980
Today we're talking about capital punishment.

7
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,859
So if you've never heard that phrase before, you might have heard another name for this topic.

8
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,739
It's called the death penalty.

9
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:20,239
Right.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,620
So if you commit a crime and basically the judge says that you will have to be put to death for that crime.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:26,980
Right.

12
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:29,379
So many countries no longer have this, this law.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,320
The United States, you can see it in some places, some states, but not in others.

14
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:39,020
So what we're talking about today is the debate between to have the death penalty and to not have it.

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:39,520
All right.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,899
So we're going to actually have a little debate in the end of if we agree that we should have the death penalty or not.

17
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:50,060
But before that, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,219
Those sound like really draconian measures.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,540
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?

20
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,780
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right person.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,480
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,980
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,439
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:54,180
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,739
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,060
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to be caught.

27
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,040
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

28
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,960
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

29
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,340
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

30
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,539
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,259
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

32
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,300
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

33
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,259
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,039
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

35
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,819
You sound like a dictator.

36
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,800
Well, if it works, why not?

37
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,020
All right.

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
So, Marco, there's a lot of really great legal terms here, legal and crime terms.

39
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,680
And so let's look at a few of these in today's language takeaway.

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,860
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:57,620
All right.

42
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,219
So let's take a look at the first one.

43
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:02,439
They mentioned juvenile offenders.

44
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,240
All right.

45
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,560
So let's look at these two words, because, well, offender can be pretty general.

46
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,500
It's someone who commits a crime.

47
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,139
So an offender.

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,439
But we're talking about a special kind of offender.

49
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,319
Here we're talking about juvenile offenders.

50
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,000
So they're young offenders.

51
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,379
Right.

52
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,900
And in America, legally, you're a juvenile offender if you're under the age of 18.

53
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:22,740
Okay.

54
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:27,139
So if you commit a crime while you are a juvenile, you get judged differently, right?

55
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:28,719
You don't get the same treatment as an adult.

56
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,060
Right.

57
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:38,139
Usually, the punishments are not as harsh, because people like to think that younger people, younger children or teenagers, they don't really understand the law.

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,819
They don't really understand crime or good and bad.

59
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,120
So it should be easier on them.

60
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:44,400
All right.

61
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:44,780
Very good.

62
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,400
So we have juvenile offenders and we also have a wrongful conviction.

63
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,060
All right.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,379
This is an uh-oh moment for a judge, because a wrongful conviction, well, conviction, first of all, is a decision.

65
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,740
So this is a court's decision on whether or not a person is guilty.

66
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,379
So you convicted the person.

67
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:03,780
Right.

68
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:08,560
Marco was convicted guilty of stealing my computer.

69
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,860
I was too.

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:10,699
That happened.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right.

72
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:18,540
But it's a wrongful conviction if Marco didn't really steal a computer, but we decided that he did.

73
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,199
Okay.

74
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,060
So it was a wrong decision.

75
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:22,639
Right.

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,699
It was a bad decision in the sense that it's actually not what happened in reality.

77
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,899
A wrongful conviction.

78
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,519
Very good.

79
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,839
And actually related to a wrongful conviction.

80
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:37,079
Many times it happens because evidence is fabricated by the police.

81
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:37,439
All right.

82
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,620
So this is a big no-no.

83
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,120
This is something that really shouldn't happen.

84
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,339
And it's against the law in many countries.

85
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,699
So fabrication or to fabricate is to fake, to make something up.

86
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,579
And so evidence that's fabricated is evidence that the police or other people create to try and make someone look guilty.

87
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,000
But it's not actually evidence.

88
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,839
It's not really true.

89
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:00,600
It's not true.

90
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:01,000
Right.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,339
And now moving on, they were talking about a deterrent for crime.

92
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:06,959
Okay.

93
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,800
So to deter is a verb.

94
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,379
To deter means to try and get someone to not do something.

95
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:12,879
All right.

96
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,699
So I'm going to try and deter my staff from taking early lunch breaks.

97
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,319
So I'm going to punish someone as a deterrent.

98
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:22,480
As a deterrent.

99
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:22,759
Okay.

100
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:27,079
So you have the verb deter and you have the noun a deterrent.

101
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:27,699
Right.

102
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,699
Yeah.

103
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,300
And so oftentimes very strict laws are meant to be deterrence.

104
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:37,120
They're meant to keep people from doing bad things, from breaking the law.

105
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:37,720
All right.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,040
So, for example, capital punishment is one of those deterrence.

107
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,800
If you kill somebody, then if you get caught, you are also going to be killed.

108
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,860
So that means I'm never going to kill anyone because I don't want the law to decide that I'm going to get killed.

109
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,459
Exactly.

110
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,819
And our last word for today, they were talking about imposing tougher laws.

111
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,600
I would impose tougher laws.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,139
Okay.

113
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,680
So to impose is a verb that means to put in place or to set up or enact.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,959
And so by force.

115
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,139
Right.

116
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,759
You don't really you don't really agree to do it.

117
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,899
Like the dictator imposes his will.

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:09,560
All right.

119
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,459
So he makes everyone do what he wants.

120
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,819
But we can impose measures that do something.

121
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:21,560
It's kind of like forcibly making people follow some kind of rule or or follow a person.

122
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,120
Now, sometimes you would see that you have a company or you have people at your house and they're like, well, you know, stay over for dinner.

123
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,720
And they're like, oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

124
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:31,420
All right.

125
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:37,639
So I wouldn't want to bother you or I wouldn't want to create more work for you because, you know, when you're making food, you have all these people.

126
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:39,759
They don't want to impose on you.

127
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,300
All right.

128
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,019
So that's another way of using this impose on somebody.

129
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:43,939
All right.

130
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:49,439
So after all of these words that we've taken a look at, why don't we start now with Fluency Builder.

131
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:51,579
Fluency Builder.

132
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,860
OK, so as you know, Fluency Builder is a place where you get to talk about some phrases and words that allow you to be more fluent in English.

133
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:03,579
So these are sometimes idioms or sometimes phrases, words that go together commonly.

134
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,819
And the first one is no exception.

135
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,279
It's a miscarriage.

136
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:08,560
So miscarriage of justice.

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,199
All right.

138
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,819
A miscarriage of justice.

139
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,879
Now, we have different words here.

140
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,120
The first one, miscarriage, it's usually related to a medical term.

141
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:16,560
Right.

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,300
It's a pregnancy.

143
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,920
Well, it's a pregnancy that has a sad result.

144
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,199
It's a pregnancy where the woman's baby dies or the woman loses the baby.

145
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,660
And a miscarriage of justice is a metaphor.

146
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,600
It's a way to say that justice was not carried out.

147
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,759
It means that, for example, with those wrongful convictions, the law failed.

148
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,480
To accomplish its objective.

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,860
Yeah, to accomplish its objective and to be fair.

150
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,360
OK, so a miscarriage of justice.

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,360
Interesting.

152
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,240
And moving on to our next phrase.

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,160
They were talking and discussing this whole death penalty situation.

154
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,019
And she mentioned in my reckoning.

155
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:56,860
All right.

156
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,259
So this is a great way to share your opinion or your idea with someone.

157
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:09,879
You're saying pretty much in my opinion, in my according to me or, you know, the way I'm thinking is this.

158
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,740
So I can also say I reckon.

159
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,339
Right.

160
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:12,800
Exactly.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,339
I reckon it's going to rain later.

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,699
I think it's going to rain.

163
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,879
So in my reckoning, in my opinion.

164
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:19,740
All right.

165
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,800
I reckon.

166
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,459
And to finish off Fluency Builder, they said that the person or the criminal couldn't get away with it.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,139
All right.

168
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,700
So this is another one of those phrases that each word maybe means something different.

169
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,360
You can get somewhere.

170
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:46,620
But put together to get away with something means to do something bad or illegal or that's not OK without getting caught or being punished or being punished.

171
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,639
So you can say get away with murder.

172
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,700
He got away with murder.

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,320
You know, he did something that was really, really bad, but no one caught him.

174
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,299
And also it means the criminal got away so they couldn't catch him.

175
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:06,019
Or I could always say to my brother, he would always lie to my parents and get away with it so that he never got caught.

176
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
He never got punished.

177
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,500
OK, so he got away with his lie or got away and got his way.

178
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,360
All right.

179
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,320
So I think this is an interesting phrase.

180
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Why don't we listen to a couple of more examples?

181
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,720
Example one.

182
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,120
Do you think we could get away with using the cheaper product?

183
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,580
Example two.

184
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,820
Thieves got away with two Picasso's, which were never found.

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,519
Example three.

186
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,960
He almost got away with murder.

187
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,919
Unfortunately for him, the police discovered his secret.

188
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,320
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,779
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,539
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

191
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, it depends on what you mean.

192
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:19,519
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offenses and lock up juvenile offenders.

193
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,539
Those sound like really draconian measures.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,840
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?

195
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,100
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right person.

196
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,840
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

197
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,340
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

198
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,820
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

199
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,519
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

200
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,100
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

201
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,440
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who committed that they're going to be caught.

202
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,379
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

203
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,299
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

204
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:14,720
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

205
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:17,879
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

206
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

207
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,639
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

208
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:30,600
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

209
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,379
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

210
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,200
You sound like a dictator.

211
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, if it works, why not?

212
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:50,879
All right, so now the big question, Catherine, do you agree with the death penalty?

213
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,980
Oh, this is a big one, and I don't think we have enough time to go into it in much detail here.

214
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,440
But I definitely think that is extreme.

215
00:11:58,679 --> 00:11:59,120
Right.

216
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,860
And so we have this phrase, draconian measures.

217
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,120
Right.

218
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,279
They mentioned that in the dialogue.

219
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,179
Yeah, so draconian, something that's draconian is excessive or severe, you know.

220
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:23,500
And I think that there are a lot of reasons not to have the death penalty because the death penalty, well, you're pretty much saying we as a society think that murder is wrong, but we're going to to show you that you've done a wrong thing, like a bad thing that's against the law by killing you.

221
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,659
All right.

222
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,419
And so I have to disagree with that on a philosophical level.

223
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,100
But what about practical?

224
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:38,000
Practically speaking, I think that there are a lot of problems with the prison system and the legal system in the United States, for example, because prisons are really crowded.

225
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,980
One percent of the American population is in prison.

226
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,980
And so I think that so long as the prison system still has problems, there's a really good argument for having the death penalty.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,620
But still, I think that it's excessive and it's unnecessary and that there are other ways to treat and punish prisoners.

228
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,620
It is an interesting topic because you have many different angles that are in favor or against the death penalty.

229
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:10,980
For example, you have religious views where you say that you should not take a life of another person no matter what, or you have other views that say that the death penalty is simply wrong and that you can't right a wrong with another wrong.

230
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,620
So it kind of doesn't make sense.

231
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:23,419
But at the same time, you do like you say, the prisons are full of people and it costs around I think it's twelve thousand dollars a year per person to keep them in prison.

232
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,779
So what do you do with all of these people that have life sentences that are going to spend the rest of their lives in jail?

233
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,159
So it is interesting.

234
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,340
And many countries are very, very strict with their legal system in comparison with the United States, right?

235
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,120
Definitely.

236
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:45,440
But there is a statistic that's pretty stunning that I think among the top 20 developed nations in the world, I think only the United States is the one with the death penalty.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,019
Exactly.

238
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:53,360
And actually the ratio of the people compared to the population that are in jail is much higher in the United States than in other countries.

239
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:53,980
That's true.

240
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,220
So it is a very questionable topic, but we want to know what you think.

241
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,220
Do you think that the death penalty is a justifiable way to do justice?

242
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,179
Or do you think maybe it's just wrong and we shouldn't have it anymore?

243
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,559
Yeah, we're hoping that this will get the conversation going on our website.

244
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,960

So we'll see you guys there.

249
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,700
Bye, everyone.

250
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:23,940
Bye.
