00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Katherine, and today we're talking about something very serious.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Very serious.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today we're talking about capital punishment.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So if you've never heard that phrase before, you might have heard another name for this topic.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's called the death penalty.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So if you commit a crime and basically the judge says that you will have to be put to death for that crime.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So many countries no longer have this, this law.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The United States, you can see it in some places, some states, but not in others.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So what we're talking about today is the debate between to have the death penalty and to not have it.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All right.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we're going to actually have a little debate in the end of if we agree that we should have the death penalty or not.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But before that, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Those sound like really draconian measures.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right person.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they're going to be caught.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You sound like a dictator.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, if it works, why not?

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, Marco, there's a lot of really great legal terms here, legal and crime terms.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And so let's look at a few of these in today's language takeaway.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All right.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So let's take a look at the first one.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They mentioned juvenile offenders.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
All right.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So let's look at these two words, because, well, offender can be pretty general.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's someone who commits a crime.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So an offender.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But we're talking about a special kind of offender.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Here we're talking about juvenile offenders.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So they're young offenders.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Right.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And in America, legally, you're a juvenile offender if you're under the age of 18.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So if you commit a crime while you are a juvenile, you get judged differently, right?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You don't get the same treatment as an adult.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Right.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Usually, the punishments are not as harsh, because people like to think that younger people, younger children or teenagers, they don't really understand the law.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They don't really understand crime or good and bad.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So it should be easier on them.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Very good.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So we have juvenile offenders and we also have a wrongful conviction.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All right.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is an uh-oh moment for a judge, because a wrongful conviction, well, conviction, first of all, is a decision.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So this is a court's decision on whether or not a person is guilty.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So you convicted the person.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Right.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Marco was convicted guilty of stealing my computer.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I was too.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That happened.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But it's a wrongful conviction if Marco didn't really steal a computer, but we decided that he did.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Okay.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So it was a wrong decision.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was a bad decision in the sense that it's actually not what happened in reality.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A wrongful conviction.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Very good.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And actually related to a wrongful conviction.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Many times it happens because evidence is fabricated by the police.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
All right.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So this is a big no-no.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is something that really shouldn't happen.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And it's against the law in many countries.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So fabrication or to fabricate is to fake, to make something up.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And so evidence that's fabricated is evidence that the police or other people create to try and make someone look guilty.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But it's not actually evidence.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not really true.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's not true.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Right.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And now moving on, they were talking about a deterrent for crime.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So to deter is a verb.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
To deter means to try and get someone to not do something.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I'm going to try and deter my staff from taking early lunch breaks.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So I'm going to punish someone as a deterrent.

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
As a deterrent.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So you have the verb deter and you have the noun a deterrent.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Right.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And so oftentimes very strict laws are meant to be deterrence.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They're meant to keep people from doing bad things, from breaking the law.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, for example, capital punishment is one of those deterrence.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you kill somebody, then if you get caught, you are also going to be killed.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So that means I'm never going to kill anyone because I don't want the law to decide that I'm going to get killed.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Exactly.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And our last word for today, they were talking about imposing tougher laws.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I would impose tougher laws.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So to impose is a verb that means to put in place or to set up or enact.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And so by force.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Right.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't really you don't really agree to do it.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like the dictator imposes his will.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
All right.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So he makes everyone do what he wants.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But we can impose measures that do something.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's kind of like forcibly making people follow some kind of rule or or follow a person.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Now, sometimes you would see that you have a company or you have people at your house and they're like, well, you know, stay over for dinner.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And they're like, oh, I wouldn't want to impose.

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
All right.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I wouldn't want to bother you or I wouldn't want to create more work for you because, you know, when you're making food, you have all these people.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They don't want to impose on you.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
All right.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So that's another way of using this impose on somebody.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
All right.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So after all of these words that we've taken a look at, why don't we start now with Fluency Builder.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Fluency Builder.

132
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
OK, so as you know, Fluency Builder is a place where you get to talk about some phrases and words that allow you to be more fluent in English.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So these are sometimes idioms or sometimes phrases, words that go together commonly.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And the first one is no exception.

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a miscarriage.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So miscarriage of justice.

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All right.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A miscarriage of justice.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now, we have different words here.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The first one, miscarriage, it's usually related to a medical term.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a pregnancy.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, it's a pregnancy that has a sad result.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a pregnancy where the woman's baby dies or the woman loses the baby.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And a miscarriage of justice is a metaphor.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a way to say that justice was not carried out.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It means that, for example, with those wrongful convictions, the law failed.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
To accomplish its objective.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, to accomplish its objective and to be fair.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
OK, so a miscarriage of justice.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Interesting.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And moving on to our next phrase.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They were talking and discussing this whole death penalty situation.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And she mentioned in my reckoning.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So this is a great way to share your opinion or your idea with someone.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You're saying pretty much in my opinion, in my according to me or, you know, the way I'm thinking is this.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So I can also say I reckon.

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Exactly.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I reckon it's going to rain later.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think it's going to rain.

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So in my reckoning, in my opinion.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All right.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I reckon.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And to finish off Fluency Builder, they said that the person or the criminal couldn't get away with it.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So this is another one of those phrases that each word maybe means something different.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can get somewhere.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But put together to get away with something means to do something bad or illegal or that's not OK without getting caught or being punished or being punished.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So you can say get away with murder.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He got away with murder.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You know, he did something that was really, really bad, but no one caught him.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And also it means the criminal got away so they couldn't catch him.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Or I could always say to my brother, he would always lie to my parents and get away with it so that he never got caught.

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He never got punished.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
OK, so he got away with his lie or got away and got his way.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
All right.

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I think this is an interesting phrase.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why don't we listen to a couple of more examples?

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Example one.

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you think we could get away with using the cheaper product?

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Example two.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thieves got away with two Picasso's, which were never found.

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Example three.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He almost got away with murder.

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Unfortunately for him, the police discovered his secret.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of great phrases.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

190
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you think we should be tougher on crime?

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, it depends on what you mean.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offenses and lock up juvenile offenders.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Those sound like really draconian measures.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you've already put innocent people to death?

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You'd only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you convicted the right person.

196
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But there have been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In some cases, it had been fabricated by the police.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there's a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who committed that they're going to be caught.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It doesn't make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But if you detect more crimes, you'll still need prisons.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they'd learn that they can't get away with it.

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals.

207
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You sound like a dictator.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, if it works, why not?

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
All right, so now the big question, Catherine, do you agree with the death penalty?

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, this is a big one, and I don't think we have enough time to go into it in much detail here.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But I definitely think that is extreme.

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right.

216
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And so we have this phrase, draconian measures.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Right.

218
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They mentioned that in the dialogue.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, so draconian, something that's draconian is excessive or severe, you know.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I think that there are a lot of reasons not to have the death penalty because the death penalty, well, you're pretty much saying we as a society think that murder is wrong, but we're going to to show you that you've done a wrong thing, like a bad thing that's against the law by killing you.

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All right.

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And so I have to disagree with that on a philosophical level.

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But what about practical?

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Practically speaking, I think that there are a lot of problems with the prison system and the legal system in the United States, for example, because prisons are really crowded.

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
One percent of the American population is in prison.

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And so I think that so long as the prison system still has problems, there's a really good argument for having the death penalty.

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But still, I think that it's excessive and it's unnecessary and that there are other ways to treat and punish prisoners.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It is an interesting topic because you have many different angles that are in favor or against the death penalty.

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:10,000
For example, you have religious views where you say that you should not take a life of another person no matter what, or you have other views that say that the death penalty is simply wrong and that you can't right a wrong with another wrong.

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So it kind of doesn't make sense.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But at the same time, you do like you say, the prisons are full of people and it costs around I think it's twelve thousand dollars a year per person to keep them in prison.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So what do you do with all of these people that have life sentences that are going to spend the rest of their lives in jail?

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So it is interesting.

234
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And many countries are very, very strict with their legal system in comparison with the United States, right?

235
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Definitely.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But there is a statistic that's pretty stunning that I think among the top 20 developed nations in the world, I think only the United States is the one with the death penalty.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Exactly.

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And actually the ratio of the people compared to the population that are in jail is much higher in the United States than in other countries.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's true.

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So it is a very questionable topic, but we want to know what you think.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Do you think that the death penalty is a justifiable way to do justice?

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Or do you think maybe it's just wrong and we shouldn't have it anymore?

243
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah, we're hoping that this will get the conversation going on our website.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If you have any opinions, please let us know about them.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000

247
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So we'll see you guys there.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Bye, everyone.

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Bye.
