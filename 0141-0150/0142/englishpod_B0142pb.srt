00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:07,259
Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,720
My name is Catherine, and that's us.

4
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:10,519
And that's us.

5
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:16,660
And today we're gonna talk about a very common situation when you're a couple, when you have a girlfriend.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,579
Honey, come on.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,280
Let's go.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:18,980
I wanna go.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:19,980
Are you?

10
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,140
You are taking forever.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,960
Alright, who takes long?

12
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:26,460
Do you take a long time to get ready to get dressed?

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:39,200
Okay, I take longer to get ready, but my boyfriend takes longer in general because he's like checking his email, playing video games, like just, you know, we call it lollygagging.

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,939
He's just like being kind of slow.

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,799
I'm the opposite.

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:57,159
I usually, I usually start getting ready later, like if we have to leave at 9, I'll start getting ready at 8.30, but I'll be ready by 9, because I take a shower real fast, get dressed, and I know what I'm gonna wear, and all my clothes are ready.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,140
But on the other hand, my girlfriend takes forever to get ready, and she's like, oh, and then, you know, the hair.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,239
Girls have makeup, and tights, and shoes.

19
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,420
But this is what I understand.

20
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,060
If we're supposed to leave at 9, why don't you start getting ready before?

21
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,879
Never underestimate women.

22
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,319
I don't know.

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,420
Procrastination.

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,939
Hey, it's not even about procrastination.

25
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:20,019
Sometimes it just takes longer to look good than other times.

26
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:21,599
Right.

27
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,939
Well, in this case, we're gonna be looking at a lesson where it's the opposite.

28
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:33,519
The husband is taking a long time to get ready, and, well, I don't think he has a very good fashion sense, right?

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:42,099
He does not, and we're gonna learn what that phrase means in a minute here, but before we get going, I've got a couple of words to preview to help you understand what's going on in today's dialogue.

30
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,079
Vocabulary preview.

31
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:48,400
All right, so vocabulary preview today, we have two words.

32
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,159
The first one can be a noun or a verb.

33
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,140
To iron.

34
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:53,540
Or iron.

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,019
So, to iron basically means to ...

36
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,579
To get the wrinkles out of clothes, and so we use this ...

37
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,200
Iron is actually a metal.

38
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,280
It's a very important metal, and an iron is a machine that we plug in.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:19,000
We use it to get the wrinkles, the lines, out of our shirts and our skirts and everything, and so it's actually a very important thing to make sure that you look nice and put together.

40
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:19,520
Right.

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,259
And so you use an iron to iron your shirt or to iron your skirt.

42
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,039
And then we have sandals, my favorite type of shoe.

43
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,719
Mine too.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,439
Sandals.

45
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,360
I have a friend who used to say she had claustrophobic feet.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,039
Her feet didn't like to be in closed spaces, and so she only wore sandals.

47
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:39,300
So these are open shoes, open toe shoes basically.

48
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,280
You wear them at the beach.

49
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,360
Or you wear them in the summer in general.

50
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,699
I'm wearing sandals right now.

51
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,060
And you have different types of sandals, like sandals and flip flops, right?

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,400
Flip flops, I think they're called that because they sound like flip flop, flip flop, when you walk.

53
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,900
All right, so those are our two words today.

54
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,439
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

55
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:57,699
And then we'll be back.

56
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,219
Honey, come on.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,219
We're going to be late.

58
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,659
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,780
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

60
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,319
Can you come here for a sec?

61
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,259
I need your help.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,900
What is it?

63
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,900
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

64
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
I don't know what to wear.

65
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:22,639
Okay, give me your opinion.

66
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,240
Do you like the way this looks?

67
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,120
The striped short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

68
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,020
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

69
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,180
Are you joking?

70
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,919
What am I going to do with you?

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,699
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

72
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,520
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,039
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,319
Thanks, honey.

75
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,080
You have such great fashion sense.

76
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,259
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

77
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,259
All right, we're back.

78
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,419
So, interesting, this husband sounded a lot like a famous president, I think.

79
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,740
He did, but we'll get to that in a minute.

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:13,080
Before we do talk about who this guy is, I think it'd be a great idea to talk about some of these clothing terms because they're very useful for when you want to go shopping and for when you're getting dressed.

81
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,339
Language takeaway.

82
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:22,480
Okay, so the first word that we have on language takeaway is striped.

83
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,300
All right, you might have heard the American flag called stars and stripes.

84
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:33,600
Stripes are those lines on clothing or on flags that go up or down or left and right.

85
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,579
So, if you have a striped shirt, you have many lines on your shirt that are going up and down or left and right.

86
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:39,980
Right.

87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,339
And they say with fashion, lines that go left to right make you look fatter, and lines that go up and down make you look thinner.

88
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,199
And taller.

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:47,839
And taller.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Very good.

91
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,279
And now moving on, if it's summer and you want to wear a shirt, you can wear a short-sleeved shirt.

92
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,819
All right, this is important.

93
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,079
So, most people like to wear short-sleeve shirts in the summertime because they're cooler.

94
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,740
And in the wintertime, that means we like to wear long-sleeved shirts.

95
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,699
Okay, so the sleeves are basically the arms of the shirt.

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,800
You say short-sleeved.

97
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,100
Very good.

98
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,839
And then we have a checkered shirt, or a checkered sweater in this case.

99
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:26,439
Okay, so checkered means there are little squares on the shirt, and usually one square is one color and the next square is another color, so it looks like a checkerboard.

100
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,439
Very good.

101
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
That game, you know, checkers?

102
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,300
Or like a chessboard.

103
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,120
Exactly.

104
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:37,759
And so, in this case, we've got a guy who's trying to wear a striped shirt and a checkered sweater.

105
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,519
That does not go well to us, right?

106
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:40,019
No.

107
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,439
Too much stuff happening.

108
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,459
It's too busy.

109
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,100
Too busy.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,740
All right.

111
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:52,699
And not only that, but he wanted to wear shorts because he liked the cuts and the hemline.

112
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:02,259
Okay, these are actually terms that we normally use with women's clothing because you could say, I like the cut of this dress, I like the shape that it has.

113
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:07,480
And hemline is the bottom of your skirt or your trousers or your shorts.

114
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:18,660
And hemline, we could say, my mother used to say this to me, the hemline is much too high, much too short, that skirt is not appropriate, yeah, so it's nice to have a hemline at the knee.

115
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:28,279
All right, so the cut is the shape that the piece of clothing has, like pants or skirts, and the hemline would be the place where it ends, right?

116
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,220
The skirt, for example.

117
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,720
It pretty much tells you the length of something.

118
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,439
Very good.

119
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,540
And now the wife steps in, she's like, no, no, you're not wearing this.

120
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:47,000
She's telling him that she has to wear nice clothes, and among those items is a silk tie.

121
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,480
Okay, so classic Father's Day gift.

122
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,220
Silk tie.

123
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,759
I've given this one a couple of times.

124
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,699
A silk tie is a neck tie, a long neck tie that's made of silk.

125
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,060
Silk is a very soft material, right?

126
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,160
Very expensive as well.

127
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,959
It can be, especially Italian silk.

128
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,720
And I've always actually wanted to have silk sheets.

129
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,459
Ooh, see, I don't know, I feel like they would get very warm in the summer.

130
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,120
Yeah, well in the winter it would be awesome, but probably very cold in the winter as well.

131
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,120
Yeah, I don't know.

132
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,740
Well, it's one of those things.

133
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,180
And then she's also telling him to wear some corduroy pants.

134
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:28,579
Okay, so it sounds like this might be a winter dialogue, because corduroy is not something you wear in the summer, because it's very heavy and thick.

135
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:46,060
Corduroy actually is a fabric that usually has these kind of ribs or ridges, and so there's like little lines in the fabric that make it quite thick and rough when you, almost, not rough, but they make it feel very unique when you touch it.

136
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,360
Yeah, it's not smooth, it's a little bit rough, the fabric.

137
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,519
Very good.

138
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,360
So those are all the clothing items that we've looked at today.

139
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:04,100
There's a lot of them, and obviously we'll post a couple of pictures on the site so you can see better what a silk tie looks like, or especially corduroy pants.

140
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:04,680
Corduroy, yeah.

141
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,860
Alright, so let's listen to this dialogue again, we're going to slow it down a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some of the phrases.

142
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,939
Honey, come on, we're going to be late.

143
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,420
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,500
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

145
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,019
Can you come here for a sec?

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,019
I need your help.

147
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,180
What is it?

148
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,120
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

149
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,620
I don't know what to wear.

150
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
OK, give me your opinion.

151
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,279
Do you like the way this looks?

152
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,139
The striped short-sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

153
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,120
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

154
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,360
Are you joking?

155
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,100
What am I going to do with you?

156
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,840
We are going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

157
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:52,679
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

158
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,179
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

159
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:56,460
Thanks, honey.

160
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,220
You have such great fashion sense.

161
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,360
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

162
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,519
Alright, we're back, so now let's start with Fluency Builder.

163
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:13,159
OK, these are classic couple phrases, right?

164
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:23,519
These are phrases you hear among couples, and the first one is maybe more common to hear from the female end, but it's not unknown on the male end.

165
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,899
So we have this question.

166
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,200
Do you like the way this looks?

167
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,179
So while the person is saying this, they would maybe be moving to the side a little bit.

168
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:34,620
Modeling it.

169
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,580
Do you like the way this looks?

170
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:40,440
So basically you're saying, do you like what I'm wearing?

171
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,500
Does it look good on me?

172
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,419
Does it look good, exactly.

173
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:53,679
You could also say, hey, I like the way this looks when you're trying to buy something at the store, and so do you like the way this looks is a way for you to ask the other person's opinion of how you look.

174
00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:02,659
And also another common phrase, especially with men who have no fashion sense, the wife says, what am I going to do with you?

175
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:13,779
OK, this is an interesting phrase, and it needs some explanation, I think, because the meaning is, well, this is very difficult, right?

176
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:17,580
So you're being difficult or, wow, you need some help from me.

177
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm going to help you.

178
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,139
How am I going to help you this much or all the time like this?

179
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,460
Right, because she's pretty much saying he has no idea about clothing and fashion.

180
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,799
So he's saying to her, what am she saying to him?

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,659
What am I going to do with you means you need so much help.

182
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,240
Seriously.

183
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,559
All right, so and the third phrase that we saw and we said at the very beginning is fashion sense.

184
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,679
OK, so this is actually what the man needs help with.

185
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,759
He needs help with his fashion sense because he has zero fashion sense.

186
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,740
And this is pretty much a way to say how much someone knows about fashion or appearances.

187
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:03,940
And so I can say, you know, oh, my friend Kathy, she has amazing fashion sense, so she always looks good.

188
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,159
Right.

189
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:11,580
So combining colors appropriately or wearing the right types of shoes with the right types of clothing, et cetera, fashion sense.

190
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,879
Or even just being able to wear things that are good on her or telling other people what's good on them.

191
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:23,320
So fashion sense is the ability to identify fashion and look good and make other people look good.

192
00:11:23,539 --> 00:11:24,000
All right.

193
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,659
Very good.

194
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,100
Let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time.

195
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,460
And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about fashion, because it's a very interesting topic.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,500
Honey, come on, we're going to be late, honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

197
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,580
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

198
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,100
Can you come here for a sec?

199
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,059
I need your help.

200
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:52,720
What is it?

201
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,700
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

202
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,399
I don't know what to wear.

203
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,139
OK.

204
00:11:57,679 --> 00:11:58,460
Give me your opinion.

205
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,039
Do you like the way this looks?

206
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,899
The striped short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

207
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,820
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

208
00:12:08,179 --> 00:12:08,980
Are you joking?

209
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,700
What am I going to do with you?

210
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,539
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

211
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,340
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

212
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,820
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

213
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,080
Thanks, honey.

214
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,860
You have such great fashion sense.

215
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,000
Now what am I going to do with my hair?

216
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,679
All right, we're back.

217
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,340
You lived in Italy for a while.

218
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,980
How is the fashion over there?

219
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,059
Is it extreme like we see on the runways?

220
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,519
Because I honestly don't understand fashion.

221
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,879
Well, the thing about runways is that that's not how normal people dress.

222
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,539
Well, yeah.

223
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,440
That's what I understand.

224
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,500
Why do they have these fashion shows if people don't really buy these types of clothing?

225
00:12:49,840 --> 00:13:01,600
Well, sometimes people like stores, for example, big stores, department stores, will buy fashions off of the runway, and they'll change them a little bit so that they're more appropriate for normal consumption.

226
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,720
That means for normal people who want to wear them.

227
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:13,539
But the runway fashions are actually, they're kind of like exaggerations of trends that will happen in the shopping world, right, in the commercial world.

228
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:23,779
So the things that you see are like big blown up exaggerations, and we take bits and pieces of those in our daily lives to dress up.

229
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:33,360
So different colors or fabrics or like oftentimes you see kind of military outfits, and so that will translate into military jackets that are very popular one season.

230
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,059
And so Italy definitely counts as a very fashionable country, but it's not crazy people.

231
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:45,100
Every once in a while, you see some crazy clothes, but I think Japan is much more crazy as far as style.

232
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,220
Yeah, actually, Asian countries such as Japan or South Korea, they have very also unique fashion as well.

233
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,360
But it's very extreme to a certain point.

234
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,360
And the color combinations they do is like red sneakers with green pants and like a blue jacket.

235
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,379
It's very crazy.

236
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:00,720
Right.

237
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,899
And very bright.

238
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,799
And you often see these shoes, you know, we call them platform shoes there.

239
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,899
It's kind of like you're standing on a brick or on a book.

240
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,860
And they're, you know, they're seven inches tall.

241
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,159
And you see these little girls wearing these big shoes.

242
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,539
And I just I'm so scared when I see them because I feel like they're gonna fall over.

243
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,120
The other thing is that fashion is so expensive.

244
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:29,659
If you actually want to buy something that's in like an authentic, I don't know, Carolina or Oscar de la Renta or something like that, it's so expensive.

245
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:30,379
It is.

246
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,899
But you know, high fashion is expensive.

247
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:42,580
Fashion is not doesn't have to be you can you can be fashionable just looking at different stores and going to secondhand shops and making your own clothes.

248
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,360
I mean, it's all about a sense of personal style and dressing yourself to be unique.

249
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,320
Or you can get at the fake market or you can go to the fake market.

250
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:49,759
Exactly.

251
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:50,659
All right.

252
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,580
That's all the time we have for today, guys.

253
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,220
