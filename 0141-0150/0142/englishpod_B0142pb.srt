00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and that's us.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And that's us.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we're gonna talk about a very common situation when you're a couple, when you have a girlfriend.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Honey, come on.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's go.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I wanna go.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Are you?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You are taking forever.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Alright, who takes long?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Do you take a long time to get ready to get dressed?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, I take longer to get ready, but my boyfriend takes longer in general because he's like checking his email, playing video games, like just, you know, we call it lollygagging.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He's just like being kind of slow.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm the opposite.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I usually, I usually start getting ready later, like if we have to leave at 9, I'll start getting ready at 8.30, but I'll be ready by 9, because I take a shower real fast, get dressed, and I know what I'm gonna wear, and all my clothes are ready.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But on the other hand, my girlfriend takes forever to get ready, and she's like, oh, and then, you know, the hair.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Girls have makeup, and tights, and shoes.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But this is what I understand.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If we're supposed to leave at 9, why don't you start getting ready before?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Never underestimate women.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Procrastination.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey, it's not even about procrastination.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sometimes it just takes longer to look good than other times.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Right.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, in this case, we're gonna be looking at a lesson where it's the opposite.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The husband is taking a long time to get ready, and, well, I don't think he has a very good fashion sense, right?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He does not, and we're gonna learn what that phrase means in a minute here, but before we get going, I've got a couple of words to preview to help you understand what's going on in today's dialogue.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All right, so vocabulary preview today, we have two words.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The first one can be a noun or a verb.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To iron.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Or iron.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, to iron basically means to ...

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
To get the wrinkles out of clothes, and so we use this ...

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Iron is actually a metal.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's a very important metal, and an iron is a machine that we plug in.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We use it to get the wrinkles, the lines, out of our shirts and our skirts and everything, and so it's actually a very important thing to make sure that you look nice and put together.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Right.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so you use an iron to iron your shirt or to iron your skirt.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And then we have sandals, my favorite type of shoe.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mine too.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sandals.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have a friend who used to say she had claustrophobic feet.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Her feet didn't like to be in closed spaces, and so she only wore sandals.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So these are open shoes, open toe shoes basically.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You wear them at the beach.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Or you wear them in the summer in general.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm wearing sandals right now.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And you have different types of sandals, like sandals and flip flops, right?

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Flip flops, I think they're called that because they sound like flip flop, flip flop, when you walk.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right, so those are our two words today.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then we'll be back.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Honey, come on.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We're going to be late.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Can you come here for a sec?

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I need your help.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What is it?

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know what to wear.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay, give me your opinion.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you like the way this looks?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The striped short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Are you joking?

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What am I going to do with you?

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Thanks, honey.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You have such great fashion sense.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
All right, we're back.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, interesting, this husband sounded a lot like a famous president, I think.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He did, but we'll get to that in a minute.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Before we do talk about who this guy is, I think it'd be a great idea to talk about some of these clothing terms because they're very useful for when you want to go shopping and for when you're getting dressed.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Language takeaway.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, so the first word that we have on language takeaway is striped.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All right, you might have heard the American flag called stars and stripes.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Stripes are those lines on clothing or on flags that go up or down or left and right.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, if you have a striped shirt, you have many lines on your shirt that are going up and down or left and right.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Right.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And they say with fashion, lines that go left to right make you look fatter, and lines that go up and down make you look thinner.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And taller.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And taller.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Very good.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And now moving on, if it's summer and you want to wear a shirt, you can wear a short-sleeved shirt.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right, this is important.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, most people like to wear short-sleeve shirts in the summertime because they're cooler.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And in the wintertime, that means we like to wear long-sleeved shirts.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, so the sleeves are basically the arms of the shirt.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Exactly.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You say short-sleeved.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Very good.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And then we have a checkered shirt, or a checkered sweater in this case.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so checkered means there are little squares on the shirt.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And usually one square is one color, and the next square is another color.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So it looks like a checkerboard.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Very good.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That game, you know, checkers.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Or like a chessboard.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Exactly.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And so, in this case, we've got a guy who's trying to wear a striped shirt and a checkered sweater.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That does not go well to us, right?

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Too much stuff happening.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's too busy.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Too busy.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And not only that, but he wanted to wear shorts because he liked the cuts and the hemline.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, these are actually terms that we normally use with women's clothing because you could say, I like the cut of this dress.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I like the shape that it has.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Very good.

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And hemline is the bottom of your skirt or your trousers or your shorts.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And hemline, we could say, my mother used to say this to me, the hemline is much too high.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ah, okay.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Much too short.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That skirt is not appropriate.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, so it's nice to have a hemline at the knee.

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
All right, so the cut is the shape that the piece of clothing has, like pants or skirts, and the hemline would be the place where it ends, right?

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The skirt, for example.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It pretty much tells you the length of something.

128
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Very good.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And now the wife steps in and she's like, no, no, you're not wearing this.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She's telling him that she has to wear nice clothes, and among those items is a silk tie.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay, so classic Father's Day gift.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Silk tie.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've given this one a couple of times.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A silk tie is a neck tie, a long neck tie that's made of silk.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Silk is a very soft material, right?

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Very expensive as well.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It can be, especially Italian silk.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I've always actually wanted to have silk sheets.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ooh, see, I don't know, I feel like they would get very warm in the summer.

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, well in the winter it would be awesome, but probably very cold in the winter as well.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, I don't know.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, it's one of those things.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And then she's also telling him to wear some corduroy pants.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, so it sounds like this might be a winter dialogue, because corduroy is not something you wear in the summer, because it's very heavy and thick.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Corduroy actually is a fabric that usually has these kind of ribs or ridges, and so there's like little lines in the fabric that make it quite thick and rough when you, almost, not rough, but they make it feel very unique when you touch it.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, it's not smooth, it's a little bit rough, the fabric.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Very good.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So those are all the clothing items that we've looked at today.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,000
There's a lot of them, and obviously we'll post a couple of pictures on the site so you can see better what a silk tie looks like, or especially corduroy pants.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Corduroy, yeah.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Alright, so let's listen to this dialogue again, we're going to slow it down a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some of the phrases.

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Honey, come on, we're going to be late.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Can you come here for a sec?

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I need your help.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What is it?

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't know what to wear.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
OK, give me your opinion.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Do you like the way this looks?

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The striped short-sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you joking?

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What am I going to do with you?

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We are going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thanks, honey.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have such great fashion sense.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's start with Fluency Builder.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
OK, these are classic couple phrases, right?

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,000
These are phrases you hear among couples, and the first one is maybe more common to hear from the female end, but it's not unknown on the male end.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So we have this question.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you like the way this looks?

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So while the person is saying this, they would maybe be moving to the side a little bit.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Modeling it.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Do you like the way this looks?

180
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So basically you're saying, do you like what I'm wearing?

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Does it look good on me?

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Does it look good, exactly.

183
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You could also say, hey, I like the way this looks when you're trying to buy something at the store, and so do you like the way this looks is a way for you to ask the other person's opinion of how you look.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And also another common phrase, especially with men who have no fashion sense, the wife says, what am I going to do with you?

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
OK, this is an interesting phrase, and it needs some explanation, I think, because the meaning is, well, this is very difficult, right?

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So you're being difficult or, wow, you need some help from me.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm going to help you.

188
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How am I going to help you this much or all the time like this?

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right, because she's pretty much saying he has no idea about clothing and fashion.

190
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So he's saying to her, what am she saying to him?

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What am I going to do with you means you need so much help.

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Seriously.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
All right, so and the third phrase that we saw and we said at the very beginning is fashion sense.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
OK, so this is actually what the man needs help with.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He needs help with his fashion sense because he has zero fashion sense.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And this is pretty much a way to say how much someone knows about fashion or appearances.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And so I can say, you know, oh, my friend Kathy, she has amazing fashion sense, so she always looks good.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So combining colors appropriately or wearing the right types of shoes with the right types of clothing, et cetera, fashion sense.

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Or even just being able to wear things that are good on her or telling other people what's good on them.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So fashion sense is the ability to identify fashion and look good and make other people look good.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
All right.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Very good.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And we'll come back and talk a little bit more about fashion, because it's a very interesting topic.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Honey, come on, we're going to be late, honestly, you take longer getting ready than I do.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I was drying my hair and ironing my shirt.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can you come here for a sec?

209
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I need your help.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What is it?

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why are all these clothes on the bed?

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I don't know what to wear.

213
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
OK.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Give me your opinion.

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Do you like the way this looks?

216
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The striped short sleeve shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

218
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you joking?

219
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What am I going to do with you?

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

222
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thanks, honey.

224
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You have such great fashion sense.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Now what am I going to do with my hair?

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
All right, we're back.

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You lived in Italy for a while.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How is the fashion over there?

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is it extreme like we see on the runways?

230
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Because I honestly don't understand fashion.

231
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, the thing about runways is that that's not how normal people dress.

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Well, yeah.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's what I understand.

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why do they have these fashion shows if people don't really buy these types of clothing?

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, sometimes people like stores, for example, big stores, department stores, will buy fashions off of the runway, and they'll change them a little bit so that they're more appropriate for normal consumption.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That means for normal people who want to wear them.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But the runway fashions are actually, they're kind of like exaggerations of trends that will happen in the shopping world, right, in the commercial world.

238
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So the things that you see are like big blown up exaggerations, and we take bits and pieces of those in our daily lives to dress up.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So different colors or fabrics or like oftentimes you see kind of military outfits, and so that will translate into military jackets that are very popular one season.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And so Italy definitely counts as a very fashionable country, but it's not crazy people.

241
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Every once in a while, you see some crazy clothes, but I think Japan is much more crazy as far as style.

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, actually, Asian countries such as Japan or South Korea, they have very also unique fashion as well.

243
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But it's very extreme to a certain point.

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And the color combinations they do is like red sneakers with green pants and like a blue jacket.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's very crazy.

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Right.

247
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And very bright.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And you often see these shoes, you know, we call them platform shoes there.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's kind of like you're standing on a brick or on a book.

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And they're, you know, they're seven inches tall.

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And you see these little girls wearing these big shoes.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And I just I'm so scared when I see them because I feel like they're gonna fall over.

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The other thing is that fashion is so expensive.

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you actually want to buy something that's in like an authentic, I don't know, Carolina or Oscar de la Renta or something like that, it's so expensive.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It is.

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But you know, high fashion is expensive.

257
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Fashion is not doesn't have to be you can you can be fashionable just looking at different stores and going to secondhand shops and making your own clothes.

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I mean, it's all about a sense of personal style and dressing yourself to be unique.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or you can get at the fake market or you can go to the fake market.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Exactly.

261
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,000
All right.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's all the time we have for today, guys.

263
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
