EnglishPod.com I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,679
Are you joking?

3
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,439
What am I going to do with you?

4
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,259
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

5
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,039
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

6
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

7
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:46,820
Thanks, honey.

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,579
You have such great fashion sense.

9
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:50,740
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?
