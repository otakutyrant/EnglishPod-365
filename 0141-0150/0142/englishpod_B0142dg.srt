EnglishPod.com I like the cut and hemline of these shorts, so I think I'll wear these as well.

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you joking?

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What am I going to do with you?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're going to a dinner party, not to the beach.

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wear this shirt with the silk tie I bought you and those corduroy pants.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's chilly outside, so you can wear this coat.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thanks, honey.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You have such great fashion sense.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, what am I going to do with my hair?
