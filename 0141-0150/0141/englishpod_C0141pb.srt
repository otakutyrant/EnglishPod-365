00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Katherine.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we've got a very, very useful lesson for all of you out there.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're bringing you part two of the What If series, which is a small series.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Small.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And it is kind of grammar-focused, but it's very, very important because you often want to talk about things that don't happen.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're calling these hypotheticals or conditional statements.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So there are many different types of hypotheticals or conditional statements.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So today we're going to be looking at the third conditional, which is probably the hardest one because it uses a little bit of a complex grammar structure.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's complex and we're actually talking about things that did not happen and that will not happen, right?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's impossible to change.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's impossible to change these because there are things that would have happened in the past but didn't.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow, that sounds confusing.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll be back to look at some phrases first.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is the good life.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We have it good, don't you think?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, of course.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What do you mean?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For example?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You see, everything happens for a reason.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Well, I have no regrets.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'll drink to that.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Alright, so two guys, you know, talking about life.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I imagine these guys as being, you know, middle-aged or a little bit older, sitting on a porch drinking a beer, talking about what could have been.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
They're kind of thinking about the past and the decisions they have made.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Alright, so before we start in the grammar, why don't we take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fluency Builder Well, Marco, this first phrase is a phrase you'll hear very often in English.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a phrase that even has philosophical roots, something we talked a lot about when we were studying Socrates back in school, but this is the good life.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The good life.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We have the good life, or I have a good life.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have a good life is a very common phrase, but here the good life is an idiom.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So, I'm living the good life, means, you know, I have no complaints about my life.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Right, so pretty much you have all your necessities covered.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And maybe you have a nice family and you have a good job and you're just happy, so this is the good life.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Very good, so you have the good life.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Now moving on to another phrase that's kind of also philosophical, you know, it says everything happens for a reason.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right, so this phrase is, well, it's also pretty common.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
People say this when bad things happen, but they also say this when good things happen.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So basically you're just saying that it's destiny.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If this bad thing happened to you, there is a reason for it.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Maybe you don't see it now, maybe not tomorrow, but maybe later you'll see why.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This often happens when people lose their jobs.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You say, well, you know, everything happens for a reason.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Maybe losing this job will allow you to find a better job.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Or maybe go back to school and study.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Or maybe meet the man or woman of your dreams.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right, so everything happens for a reason, very good.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And then the guy agrees and says, well, I'll drink to that.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, so this is a way for people speaking English to say, listen, I agree with you, I like that idea, and I will cheers.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Cheers, right.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So this means we're going to touch our glasses or touch our beer bottles and we're going to think about how this is a nice thought.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Everything happens for a reason is positive.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a way to say, listen, good things can happen from this.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So he's saying, yes, I agree, cheers.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll drink to that.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll drink to that.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, pretty interesting phrases.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They're very common, I guess, like colloquial, right?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So you can use them in everyday conversation with a friend.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And, you know, oftentimes we say, for example, something really positive, like, I'm really glad I have such great friends.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And then everyone says, oh, I'll drink to that.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Right.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so this is something you'll hear when you're out with friends or with family.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And they may sound funny at first, but you will recognize them when you're speaking to people who speak English.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
All right.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So right.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So let's listen to our dialogue again, and then we'll come back and explain the grammar.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is the good life.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We have it good, don't you think?

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, of course.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What do you mean?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
For example?

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist, like I would if I wanted to.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I see.

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You see, everything happens for a reason.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident 10 years ago.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, I have no regrets.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll drink to that.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Beep, beep, beep.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
All right, so now it's time for grammar breakdown.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Grammar breakdown.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So in grammar breakdown, we're going to look at the two main parts of these phrases that allow us to talk about things that didn't happen.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So we're talking about looking back at our life and seeing what decisions and what actions we made.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And in this case, we have a great sentence here.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
All right, so let's look at the first part before the comma.

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If I hadn't studied architecture, so now we have the conditional if.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So Marco, big question, did he study architecture?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He did.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He did.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So if I hadn't studied architecture, it means I did study architecture.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But if I had not studied it, okay, so this is if I could change the past, then what would I have done?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I would have become an artist.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, so he wanted to be an artist, but he didn't become an artist.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He studied architecture instead.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, very good.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can see the two parts here.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We have one, the condition.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If I hadn't done this thing, and then afterwards we have the result, then I would have become an artist.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So this is the hypothetical.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Very good.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And when we see the condition, you see the structure of the sentence is had plus verb in past participle.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So if I hadn't studied architecture, and this is called the past perfect, right?

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And then the result, as you said, would have become, this is the present perfect, have or has plus verb in past participle.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's look at another example.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, so we've got the same idea here, but we've got it flipped.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We've got these two parts in different places, and so he's pretty much saying, if I hadn't moved to this town, then I wouldn't have gotten married.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But what did happen?

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He did move to this town, and he did get married.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Exactly.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So then, yeah, like you say, he changed the condition, and you can do this.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can put the condition in the beginning or at the end.

132
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And again, the structure is the same.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I would have gotten married, right?

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Have gotten.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is present perfect.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Have or has, depending on the subject, plus the verb in past participle.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And then the past perfect or the condition had plus verb in past participle, hadn't moved to this town.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All right?

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's a lot of grammar.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a lot of grammar, but it's very easy once you just start using it.

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't think too much about, okay, what do I do here?

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Just if you get the rhythm and you start using it in the same way, then it kind of comes out naturally.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And if you make a little mistake, there's not a big deal because even we do it, you know?

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Exactly.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, let's try a couple of examples off the top of our heads.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
First of all, if I hadn't moved to China, I wouldn't have learned Chinese.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Very good.

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you did move to China and you did learn Chinese.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So your turn.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All right.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If my parents hadn't spoken Spanish to me when I was a kid, I wouldn't have become fluent in Spanish.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So your parents did speak Spanish to you and you did become fluent in Spanish.

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So not bad.

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Right.

156
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,000
As you can see, you can use it not only to think about things in the past that you can't change anymore, but just also, you know, kind of remember or say, you know, oh, if this hadn't happened, the result.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Or if I hadn't opened my big mouth, my best friend wouldn't have gotten so angry at me.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Exactly.

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I said something stupid and my friend did get angry and now I feel bad about it.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It happens.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Very good.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I hope it's clear.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It does sound a little bit complicated, but this is what our website is for.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You want to make some of your own sentences and practice some of these new things, then come to our website, post some comments, and we are happy to correct and add our own commentary on those.

168
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Exactly.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So before we go, let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is the good life.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We have it good.

172
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't you think?

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, of course.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What do you mean?

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
For example?

178
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I see.

180
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You see, everything happens for a reason.

182
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

183
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, I have no regrets.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll drink to that.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Alright, we're back.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So, Catherine, any other regrets maybe in your life apart from opening your mouth?

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Any other regrets?

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If my parents had spoken Spanish to me as a kid, I would have learned.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But instead, I just learned English and that's all.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Your mom is half Swedish, right?

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Half Swedish, half Czech.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And she never spoke any of these languages to you?

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, she didn't speak Swedish or Czech.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Her parents spoke English as their common language, but she grew up speaking Italian and German, but she didn't speak to me in those languages.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And then as an adult, she forgot some of it, some of them.

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so, because my dad was, well, they're both Americans now, but my dad's American, they just spoke English to me.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Wow.

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But now you speak Italian, so do you ever try and talk to your mom in Italian?

199
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Sometimes.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My grandmother's Italian is much better, so my grandmother's completely fluent, so I speak to her in Italian and German as well.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
She's fluent in German too and I studied German in school.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
See, this is the interesting thing now.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So many people are speaking so many languages and before, if you spoke another foreign language, it was a big deal.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Oh yeah.

205
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But now it's like a requirement.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You have to at least dominate your own native language and a foreign language, right?

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So if your native language is English, you at least have to speak Spanish or Chinese or some other language.

208
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Definitely true.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I think there are a lot of people, a lot of our users that speak maybe two or three languages, and English is just one more, so more power to them.

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This is a really great skill to have and I think it's really important to keep on going with it even though it's frustrating sometimes.

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And actually once you've been able, and actually once you've mastered two or three different languages, then the fourth and fifth just becomes easier.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Actually it's true.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It sounds funny when you hear it because you're like, how could it be easier to learn more?

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But your brain starts to understand patterns better, right?

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And so it just becomes more natural for you.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It picks up patterns from the two or three other different languages that you dominate.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's weird.

218
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's strange how the brain works.

219
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
All right, guys.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So that's all for today.
