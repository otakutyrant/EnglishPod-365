00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com This is the good life.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have it good, don't you think?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, of course.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Although, don't you ever wonder what could have been?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you mean?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Like, for example, if I hadn't studied architecture, I would have become an artist like I wanted to.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I see.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, now that I think of it, I wouldn't have gotten married if I hadn't moved to this town and met Sally.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You see, everything happens for a reason.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We wouldn't even have met if I hadn't been in that car accident ten years ago.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, I have no regrets.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'll drink to that.
