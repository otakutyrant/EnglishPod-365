00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we're going to play a game.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to describe someone's face, so we're going to try to guess who that person is.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so there are lots of really great words to describe people's faces in this lesson.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's play a game.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How about Scrabble?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, no.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's see.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, my turn.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, he's also bald.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Your future husband.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Not funny.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So now let's take a look at five key words that we have to describe someone's face on language takeaway.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So we've got a couple words for noses here.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They're adjectives to describe noses.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The first one that we heard is Roman nose.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so if someone has a Roman nose, does that mean they're from Rome?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, not quite.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, Rome, as we know, is a city in Italy, but it's also an adjective here.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Roman means that the nose is straight on top.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's like a triangle.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, but it's kind of long.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You have kind of a long, straight nose, right?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A very long, straight nose.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, so we have Roman nose, somebody that has a long, straight nose.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now what about a pointy nose?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A pointy nose means that the tip of the nose is pointy.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So maybe it goes up a little bit, goes down, and then up, but usually there's a point on the tip of the nose.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Or sometimes the nose is very thin, right?

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not very wide, so it looks very pointy.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So it kind of gets very narrow at the end.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, and now maybe you broke your nose once, or you had an accident, and some people have a crooked nose.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, a lot of very famous football players have crooked noses, because you know, you get hit in the face with the football, and then your nose always has a bump.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Something is crooked if it's not straight.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So crooked is the opposite of a Roman nose or a straight nose.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So maybe you see boxers also, I think, have crooked nose, most of them, or hockey players and stuff like that.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, they take a lot of hits to the face.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay, so now moving on, we've described rote noses in many ways.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You can say long nose, short nose, or whatever, but this is another way of doing it.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And what about eyebrows?

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay, eyebrows are those lines of hair above your eyes, and some people have really thick eyebrows, some people have very thin eyebrows.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But if someone has thick eyebrows, lots of hair, we call them bushy eyebrows.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, so if you have bushy eyebrows, it means that you have a lot of hair, as you said, your eyebrows, or over your eye, okay?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And now this is a really, I think, kind of a nice feature that some people have.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
On their cheeks, we have dimples.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I love dimples.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Not many people have them, but these are two little dots, little indentations that appear when a person smiles.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So maybe you've seen this, or maybe you have this, or a friend has this, somebody smiles, and on their cheeks, towards the middle of the cheek, they have little holes that form that look like, I don't know, like somebody kind of pinched it with a needle.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, like it goes down a little bit for some reason, it goes like, yeah, they're being pinched inside their cheek.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Those are called dimples.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Dimples.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, so a lot of great stuff there in the first part.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's review what we've heard, let's go back to the dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's play a game.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, how about Scrabble?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's see, he has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, my turn.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, he's also bald.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your future husband.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not funny.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All right, we're back.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So now we're going to take a look at even more words on how to describe a face.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So now let's take a look at language takeaway part two.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Language takeaway.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so the first word has to do with the eyes.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We just talked about the eyebrows, those are above your eyes.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, what happens if your eyes are very, very deep in your face?

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay, we heard that in the dialogue, the cousin, we heard that in the dialogue described as sunken eyes.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So sunken means very far back or very deep in something.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's right.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Think about a sunken ship, it's under the water, under the ocean.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So someone with sunken eyes probably has dark rings under their eyes because their eyes are so deep in their head.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's right.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now I guess the opposite, maybe you've seen people that have eyes that are almost like popping out a little bit.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Right, his eyes pop out, that means they come out of the face, they're closer to the skin.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, and now this is something that many people have and even some models have become famous because of this.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Many times called a beauty mark, we're talking about moles.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Cindy Crawford is probably the model you're talking about, she had a very famous mole.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A mole is basically a spot on your skin that's very, very dark.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So sometimes there's hair on it, sometimes its texture is different, but it can be big, it can be small, but it's a change of texture on your skin.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So usually it's like a little brown ball if it's big, and sometimes they just look like little spots on your skin, little dark brown spots.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's right, but they're not the same as something else we heard in today's dialogue, so we'll wait for that.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But a mole usually comes a little bit off the skin, and it's usually bigger than other dots.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's right.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And I think what you're talking about is freckles.

116
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right, freckles.

117
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A lot of people have these when they're children.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They come on your nose and your cheeks and even your arms, and they're smooth with your skin.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
They don't come off your skin, they're not puffy.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's right.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So I think many of you maybe if you have lighter skin may have freckles, and that's usually just little spots but of just different color on your skin.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So usually people that have maybe red hair, you know, they have freckles.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Like maybe from the Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter's best friend, I think Ron.

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ron, yeah.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You can see he has freckles.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right, on his skin he has lots of little dots because he has very pale skin and red hair, so these are called freckles.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay, and now when we talked about lips, a nice way of describing lips, you can say big lips, but that just means that they're big, right?

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But what about if that person has full lips?

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Full lips is a great way to describe big lips.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We would say someone like Angelina Jolie has very full lips.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's right.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This means that they're not thin, but they've got a lot of puff to them.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right, they have a lot of texture.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
As you said, Angelina Jolie is probably the best example of someone with full lips.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And now what about bald, someone who's bald?

137
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Who's a good example for this?

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, so this next word we've got is bald.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who's a famous bald person?

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Maybe you've heard of Kobe Bryant.

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That basketball player.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's right.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Now, he's not completely bald.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He actually shaves his head.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But anyone who shaves their head also, or has no hair on their head, is considered to be a bald person.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Alright, so bald means no hair on their head.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right, now sometimes naturally people become bald.

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hair falls off as the years go by, and no more hair grows on their head, so they're bald.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's right, so this happens to a lot of people, especially men.

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
They lose their hair, some people have a little bit of hair, some people lose all of their hair, but when you lose hair on your head, it's called going bald.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, so now we have a lot of words on how we can describe people, and so why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's play a game.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, how about Scrabble?

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's see, he has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

161
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, my turn.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, he's also bald.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Your future husband.

167
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Not funny.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So we've talked a lot about the different parts of the face, but we have not talked about one important part.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's the bottom of a person's face along that bone there.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What's that part called?

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's called the chin.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, so we can say some people have very, very prominent or big chins, right?

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like, for example, Jay Leno.

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, yeah, his chin is so big.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Right?

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's almost a joke among people that he has this big chin.

177
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So he has a long chin.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Now, other people may have a very squared chin, right?

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it's almost like it looks like a square on the bottom of their face.

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Otherwise, you could have a round chin.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And the opposite part of the face is also very important.

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We call it not the top of your head, but we call it your forehead.

185
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Your forehead.

186
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Now, some people have a very big forehead, right?

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Because maybe their hair grows a little bit further back.

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And other people have smaller foreheads that you almost can't even really see.

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Or sometimes they just hide it with their hair.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's right.

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And actually, talking about chins, there's another type of chin that's also very popular.

192
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
John Travolta's chin.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That is.

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He has a dimple in his chin.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's right.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I remember we were talking about dimples, those little holes.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, you can have them in other places, and the chin is one of them.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's right.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So I think that's called a butt chin, if I'm not mistaken, right?

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm not even going to ask.

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I've heard it before.

202
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm not sure how to answer you, but yeah.

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
All right.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But maybe this is a good time to encourage you all to tell us about your facial features or to describe someone for us.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Use some of the vocabulary that you heard today.

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right.

207
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Or maybe you even just want to describe someone famous, and we can guess who you're talking about.

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Good challenge.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So we will see you on our website, EnglishPod.com.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All right.

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
We'll see you guys there.

212
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bye.

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bye.
