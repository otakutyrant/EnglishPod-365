00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,940
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,679
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,919
My name is Kathryn, and today we're going to play a game.

4
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:08,619
That's right.

5
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:14,279
Today we're going to describe someone's face, so we're going to try to guess who that person is.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,019
Okay, so there are lots of really great words to describe people's faces in this lesson.

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,780
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,859
Let's play a game.

9
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:33,420
How about Scrabble?

10
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:34,439
No, no.

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,159
A friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,759
I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is.

13
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,500
Okay.

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:42,799
Let's see.

15
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,359
He has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,579
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,820
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,859
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

19
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,539
Okay, my turn.

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,240
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,640
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,079
Oh, he's also bald.

23
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:10,400
Your future husband.

24
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,280
Not funny.

25
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:21,359
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,420
So now let's take a look at five key words that we have to describe someone's face on language takeaway.

27
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,620
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,420
So we've got a couple words for noses here.

29
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,260
They're adjectives to describe noses.

30
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:39,379
The first one that we heard is Roman nose.

31
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,319
Okay, so if someone has a Roman nose, does that mean they're from Rome?

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,680
No, not quite.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,480
Well, Rome, as we know, is a city in Italy, but it's also an adjective here.

34
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:55,019
Roman means that the nose is straight on top.

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,060
It's like a triangle.

36
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,840
Okay, but it's kind of long.

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,079
You have kind of a long, straight nose, right?

38
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,359
That's right.

39
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,280
A very long, straight nose.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,060
Okay, so we have Roman nose, somebody that has a long, straight nose.

41
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,520
Now what about a pointy nose?

42
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:14,159
A pointy nose means that the tip of the nose is pointy.

43
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,360
So maybe it goes up a little bit, goes down, and then up, but usually there's a point on the tip of the nose.

44
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,740
Or sometimes the nose is very thin, right?

45
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,020
It's not very wide, so it looks very pointy.

46
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:27,740
That's right.

47
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,939
So it kind of gets very narrow at the end.

48
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,460
That's right.

49
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:37,740
Okay, and now maybe you broke your nose once, or you had an accident, and some people have a crooked nose.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,379
Yeah, a lot of very famous football players have crooked noses, because you know, you get hit in the face with the football, and then your nose always has a bump.

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,879
Something is crooked if it's not straight.

52
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,780
So crooked is the opposite of a Roman nose or a straight nose.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,500
That's right.

54
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,960
So maybe you see boxers also, I think, have crooked nose, most of them, or hockey players and stuff like that.

55
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,500
Yeah, they take a lot of hits to the face.

56
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,860
Okay, so now moving on, we've described rote noses in many ways.

57
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,840
You can say long nose, short nose, or whatever, but this is another way of doing it.

58
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,800
And what about eyebrows?

59
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:23,960
Okay, eyebrows are those lines of hair above your eyes, and some people have really thick eyebrows, some people have very thin eyebrows.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,840
But if someone has thick eyebrows, lots of hair, we call them bushy eyebrows.

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:38,879
Okay, so if you have bushy eyebrows, it means that you have a lot of hair, as you said, your eyebrows, or over your eye, okay?

62
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,479
And now this is a really, I think, kind of a nice feature that some people have.

63
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,159
On their cheeks, we have dimples.

64
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,460
I love dimples.

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:56,460
Not many people have them, but these are two little dots, little indentations that appear when a person smiles.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,319
That's right.

67
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:11,840
So maybe you've seen this, or maybe you have this, or a friend has this, somebody smiles, and on their cheeks, towards the middle of the cheek, they have little holes that form that look like, I don't know, like somebody kind of pinched it with a needle.

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,759
Yeah, like it goes down a little bit for some reason, it goes like, yeah, they're being pinched inside their cheek.

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,459
That's right.

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,480
Those are called dimples.

71
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:20,220
Dimples.

72
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,620
Okay, so a lot of great stuff there in the first part.

73
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's review what we've heard, let's go back to the dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

74
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,480
Let's play a game.

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,060
Okay, how about Scrabble?

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,779
No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

77
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,399
I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is.

78
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,120
Okay.

79
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's see, he has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

80
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,199
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,439
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

82
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,500
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

83
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,160
Okay, my turn.

84
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,860
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

85
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,259
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

86
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,699
Oh, he's also bald.

87
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,040
Your future husband.

88
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,879
Not funny.

89
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,480
All right, we're back.

90
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,699
So now we're going to take a look at even more words on how to describe a face.

91
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,139
So now let's take a look at language takeaway part two.

92
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,060
Language takeaway.

93
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,459
Okay, so the first word has to do with the eyes.

94
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,180
We just talked about the eyebrows, those are above your eyes.

95
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,579
Well, what happens if your eyes are very, very deep in your face?

96
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:59,100
Okay, we heard that in the dialogue, the cousin, we heard that in the dialogue described as sunken eyes.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,660
So sunken means very far back or very deep in something.

98
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,439
That's right.

99
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,279
Think about a sunken ship, it's under the water, under the ocean.

100
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,759
So someone with sunken eyes probably has dark rings under their eyes because their eyes are so deep in their head.

101
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,500
That's right.

102
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,100
Now I guess the opposite, maybe you've seen people that have eyes that are almost like popping out a little bit.

103
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,199
Right, his eyes pop out, that means they come out of the face, they're closer to the skin.

104
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:26,939
That's right.

105
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Okay, and now this is something that many people have and even some models have become famous because of this.

106
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,019
Many times called a beauty mark, we're talking about moles.

107
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,060
Cindy Crawford is probably the model you're talking about, she had a very famous mole.

108
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,420
A mole is basically a spot on your skin that's very, very dark.

109
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:58,620
So sometimes there's hair on it, sometimes its texture is different, but it can be big, it can be small, but it's a change of texture on your skin.

110
00:06:58,819 --> 00:06:59,180
That's right.

111
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:08,420
So usually it's like a little brown ball if it's big, and sometimes they just look like little spots on your skin, little dark brown spots.

112
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,399
That's right, but they're not the same as something else we heard in today's dialogue, so we'll wait for that.

113
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:18,360
But a mole usually comes a little bit off the skin, and it's usually bigger than other dots.

114
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,040
That's right.

115
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,759
And I think what you're talking about is freckles.

116
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,959
That's right, freckles.

117
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,120
A lot of people have these when they're children.

118
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,620
They come on your nose and your cheeks and even your arms, and they're smooth with your skin.

119
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,300
They don't come off your skin, they're not puffy.

120
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,100
That's right.

121
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:47,759
So I think many of you maybe if you have lighter skin may have freckles, and that's usually just little spots but of just different color on your skin.

122
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,740
So usually people that have maybe red hair, you know, they have freckles.

123
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,199
Like maybe from the Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter's best friend, I think Ron.

124
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:57,759
Ron, yeah.

125
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,300
You can see he has freckles.

126
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:06,180
That's right, on his skin he has lots of little dots because he has very pale skin and red hair, so these are called freckles.

127
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,100
That's right.

128
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:17,100
Okay, and now when we talked about lips, a nice way of describing lips, you can say big lips, but that just means that they're big, right?

129
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,680
But what about if that person has full lips?

130
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,279
Full lips is a great way to describe big lips.

131
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,779
We would say someone like Angelina Jolie has very full lips.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,420
That's right.

133
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,620
This means that they're not thin, but they've got a lot of puff to them.

134
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,100
Right, they have a lot of texture.

135
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,500
As you said, Angelina Jolie is probably the best example of someone with full lips.

136
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,919
And now what about bald, someone who's bald?

137
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
Who's a good example for this?

138
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,220
Okay, so this next word we've got is bald.

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,820
Who's a famous bald person?

140
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:49,700
Maybe you've heard of Kobe Bryant.

141
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,279
That basketball player.

142
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,799
That's right.

143
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,399
Now, he's not completely bald.

144
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,039
He actually shaves his head.

145
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,279
But anyone who shaves their head also, or has no hair on their head, is considered to be a bald person.

146
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,320
Alright, so bald means no hair on their head.

147
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:08,500
Right, now sometimes naturally people become bald.

148
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,500
Hair falls off as the years go by, and no more hair grows on their head, so they're bald.

149
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,639
That's right, so this happens to a lot of people, especially men.

150
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:26,340
They lose their hair, some people have a little bit of hair, some people lose all of their hair, but when you lose hair on your head, it's called going bald.

151
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,100
That's right.

152
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:36,620
Okay, so now we have a lot of words on how we can describe people, and so why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

153
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,740
Let's play a game.

154
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,299
Okay, how about Scrabble?

155
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,019
No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

156
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,700
I'm going to describe someone's face, and you guess who it is.

157
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,360
Okay.

158
00:09:54,059 --> 00:10:00,240
Let's see, he has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

159
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,460
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,679
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

161
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,779
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

162
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:11,419
Okay, my turn.

163
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

164
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,559
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

165
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,960
Oh, he's also bald.

166
00:10:21,299 --> 00:10:22,259
Your future husband.

167
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:24,179
Not funny.

168
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,919
So we've talked a lot about the different parts of the face, but we have not talked about one important part.

169
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,980
That's the bottom of a person's face along that bone there.

170
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:37,960
What's that part called?

171
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,919
That's called the chin.

172
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,519
Okay, so we can say some people have very, very prominent or big chins, right?

173
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,100
Like, for example, Jay Leno.

174
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,039
Oh, yeah, his chin is so big.

175
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,320
Right?

176
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,559
It's almost a joke among people that he has this big chin.

177
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:53,039
That's right.

178
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,600
So he has a long chin.

179
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,500
Now, other people may have a very squared chin, right?

180
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,659
So it's almost like it looks like a square on the bottom of their face.

181
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,379
Otherwise, you could have a round chin.

182
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,100
That's right.

183
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,879
And the opposite part of the face is also very important.

184
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,940
We call it not the top of your head, but we call it your forehead.

185
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,919
Your forehead.

186
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,519
Now, some people have a very big forehead, right?

187
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:19,320
Because maybe their hair grows a little bit further back.

188
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,899
And other people have smaller foreheads that you almost can't even really see.

189
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,720
Or sometimes they just hide it with their hair.

190
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:25,659
That's right.

191
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,980
And actually, talking about chins, there's another type of chin that's also very popular.

192
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,679
John Travolta's chin.

193
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,360
That is.

194
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,779
He has a dimple in his chin.

195
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,440
That's right.

196
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,580
I remember we were talking about dimples, those little holes.

197
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,840
Well, you can have them in other places, and the chin is one of them.

198
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,440
That's right.

199
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,559
So I think that's called a butt chin, if I'm not mistaken, right?

200
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,679
I'm not even going to ask.

201
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,120
I've heard it before.

202
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm not sure how to answer you, but yeah.

203
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,240
All right.

204
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,580
But maybe this is a good time to encourage you all to tell us about your facial features or to describe someone for us.

205
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,899
Use some of the vocabulary that you heard today.

206
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:01,440
That's right.

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,019
Or maybe you even just want to describe someone famous, and we can guess who you're talking about.

208
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:05,960
Good challenge.

209
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,240
So we will see you on our website, EnglishPod.com.

210
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:08,480
All right.

211
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,100
We'll see you guys there.

212
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,419
Bye.

213
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:09,620
Bye.
