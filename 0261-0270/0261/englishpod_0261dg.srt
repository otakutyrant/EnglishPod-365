00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:08,880
EnglishPod.com Let's play a game.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,460
Okay, how about Scrabble?

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,160
No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,980
I'm going to describe someone's face and you guess who it is.

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:18,519
Okay.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:25,399
Let's see, he has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,820
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,920
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,560
Okay, my turn.

11
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:40,240
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

12
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,659
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,079
Oh, he's also bald.

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,420
Your future husband.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,259
Not funny.
