00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Let's play a game.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, how about Scrabble?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to describe someone's face and you guess who it is.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's see, he has a Roman nose, bushy eyebrows, and dimples.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Our cousin Pete, my turn.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes, and a mole on her chin.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Aunt Rose, that mole is so huge.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, my turn.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He has a crooked nose and full lips.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He has quite a few freckles and an oval face.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, he's also bald.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Your future husband.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Not funny.
