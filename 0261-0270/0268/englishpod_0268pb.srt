00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have a lesson that comes actually from a user request.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We had a user request who asked us if we can do something about a purchasing manager, maybe what his job does or what it is to be a purchasing manager.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So you'll find out all about that today in this lesson.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's an upper intermediate about being a purchasing manager and about vendors.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's check out today's dialogue.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've come to talk with you about ordering the 8-megapixel cameras for our new Mi phone.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The demand for phone cameras is growing, and Pear has been falling behind in the market.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's great.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right now our contract is for the 5-megapixel cameras.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is Pear still interested in having those?

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So we're changing all the cameras to 8-megapixels.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate a better deal.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Surely.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right, we're back.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So a very interesting job to be a purchasing manager, a lot of responsibility on top of him.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And we actually saw some really interesting phrases and words that are related to business, to negotiating, contracts, et cetera.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So let's take a look at some of those now on Language Takeaway.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Language Takeaway.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So the first word we have is vendor.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is a noun.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It means it's a job.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's the name of a person's job.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So he is a vendor.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, and a vendor, what does a vendor do?

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, a vendor sells things.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so the verb here is to vend.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Like a vending machine is that machine that you can buy sodas from.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But a vendor is someone who sells things to someone else.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so I can say he is a door vendor.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He sells doors?

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, that's right.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Or let me contact my vendor about the price list for these TVs.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, very good.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we're talking about a vendor who is going out of business.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And because he's going out of business, this manager is actually looking for a suitable replacement.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So this is an interesting phrase because these two words normally go together.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We say, let's find a replacement.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, that's good.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But really, we want a suitable replacement.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And so first of all, the word suitable means like appropriate or good.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
But what about replacement?

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What does this mean?

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A replacement is something that takes the place of, it replaces something else.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So for example, we have our vendor who went out of business.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So what we are looking now for is another vendor, but not just any vendor, a suitable vendor, one that has the things that we need or the prices that we need.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And in order to replace the one that went out of business.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Right, so we could say this about other things, not just people.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
For example, if I break my iPhone, my cell phone, very expensive phone, I'm upset about it.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But when I buy a new one, I don't want a cheap one.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want a suitable replacement, one that's about the same as the old one.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's right.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So maybe you don't get the exact same one, but you get one that's very similar.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, very good.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So now they're gonna talk a little bit about the contract, but they kind of do a little bit of small talk and they're talking about coffee and he says, well, you know, I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my morning coffee fix.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know how that feels.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is a person who loves to drink caffeine to wake up.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And so we talk about a fix as being something that you need, okay?

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My coffee fix means the coffee that I drink in the morning to survive.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, so we know the verb to fix is to make something good again, to repair.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But in this case, we're taking fix as a noun and we're saying that it's something that you need.

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Like you said, for example, maybe in the morning you need your English fix and so you'd listen to English pod.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Exactly.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You need it so much, it's like a drug.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Very good.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And moving on, they started to talk a little bit more about the details of the business and he mentioned that they want to make this company their sole supplier for cameras.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, so sole, S-O-L-E, means only.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But this word supplier is very interesting because it's very similar to vendor.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So it's basically someone, a company maybe, or a person that supplies you with what you need.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
All right, so to supply is to provide for.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So for example, if I work at a clothing store and I sell lots of nice clothing, I need a supplier to bring me the clothes that I sell, otherwise where am I going to get them from?

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't have a factory.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
For example, IBM is one of the biggest computer suppliers or manufacturers in the world.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
All right.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And for the last part of the dialogue, they said, well, I think we can reach an agreement.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They're going to draft a contract.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, so this is interesting because we don't use the verb to write a contract.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now you would think, well, of course you write it, but there's a special verb that we use with the word contract.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So just remember this phrase together, to draft a contract, or my company will draft a contract and send it to you.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This means to prepare a contract in order for someone to sign it.

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So it's basically the same as write, but it's usually used more with contracts, to draft a contract.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Exactly.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Or maybe you can say to draft up a business plan.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Exactly.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So to draft a plan, to draft a contract, this is basically to write something that has many different points, many different strategies.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, very good.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So five key words for you there.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Now let's move on to some key phrases on Fluency Builder.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Fluency Builder.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So there are a lot of really, really juicy phrases in today's lesson.

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The first one is rest assured.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So we heard this from Michael at the beginning of the dialogue.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He said, rest assured that you can count on us.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Rest assured.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So this is a phrase that you use to try to give confidence to someone, telling them, you can trust me, rest assured that I'll be there.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't worry.

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't worry.

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So let's hear another example of it.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Rest assured, Marco, I will be there to support you.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So I know that you will be there, or I can trust that you'll be there.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Very good.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So to rest assured.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now the second part of it is in that same sentence, well, rest assure that you can count on us.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So what does it mean to count on us, to count on me?

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So the verb to count has a couple of different meanings, and most of us are familiar with the other one.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
To count numbers.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
One, two, three, four, five.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But here, to count on someone, remember that preposition on, means to expect someone to do something, to depend on someone.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So if you count on someone, means that you depend on them, you rely on them, you can trust them.

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So for example, in the sentence that I just told Marco, rest assured I will be there, you can count on me.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That means you can depend on me, you can expect me to be there, I will not let you down.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In that same sentence, we have another phrasal verb.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Rest assure that you can count on us to be here for the long run.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The long run.

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All right.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So we're not actually running here.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The long run is a phrase that means for a long time.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So for example, if I'm in an interview and someone asks me, well, we're really interested in your, you know, your resume, and we really like you, we want to know, are you available in the long run, in the long term?

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So if you say, yes, I am here for the long run, it means that you are here for a long time.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mm hmm.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And let's move on to our next phrase, when they're actually, you know, they stopped with a small talk, and now they want to get down to business.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You hear this phrase all the time, because you don't just walk into a meeting and start talking about business stuff, you know, you start with the nice things first, you say, how was your weekend?

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
How's your wife?

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How was that game of golf?

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So you're talking about nice, small talk, like you just said, Marco, but when you want to start talking about numbers or products, things like that, that is called business.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So when you want to start that, you say, let's get down to business.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Very good.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So it's a phrase to say, okay, now let's start talking about what we came here to do, start talking about business.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And the last phrase that we have for you, it's a very interesting phrase.

153
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When they were talking about one of the brands of phones, they're saying, I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

154
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Marco, I wish I could tell you I knew where this phrase came from, but I don't.

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's just talk about the word bandwagon first.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I think bandwagon means something that everyone is doing.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's right.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I think if everyone is, I don't know, likes the color purple and all of a sudden you like the color purple, then that means you just jumped on the bandwagon.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All right.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I jumped on the bandwagon.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So you think of a wagon as like, you know, before they had cars, they had wagons, they're wooden and they have wheels and they're pulled by a horse.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And so everyone is on there and they're all going somewhere.

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And I wasn't on it, but I jumped on the back.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That means I joined everyone.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I started to do what they're doing.

166
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's right.

167
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And so I guess you agree with them or you're going towards in the same direction that everyone else is going.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Look at Marco.

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He just bought an iPhone.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now he's jumped on the bandwagon.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's right.

172
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So everyone is going in the same direction.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Everyone is doing the same thing.

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Everyone likes the same thing.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So to jump on the bandwagon, you can use it in the business sense, for example, if somebody is not agreeing with you or somebody doesn't want to support your project, you can say, I would really appreciate it if you jumped on the bandwagon and supported us on this.

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's right.

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So it's not always a bad thing, but remember that the verb that is synonymous with this is to conform, okay, to do what everyone else is doing.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So a lot of interesting things here.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Good morning, Angela.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How have you been lately?

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Morning, Michael.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, I've been very busy lately.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
One of our other vendors is going out of business and I've been searching for a suitable replacement.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run.

188
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Please sit down.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Coffee?

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, thanks.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've been trying to cut down on the caffeine.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I could never do that.

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my morning coffee fix.

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's get down to business then.

195
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new Mi phone.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The demand for phone cameras is growing and Pear has been falling behind in the market.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's great.

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

200
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras.

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is Pear still interested in having those?

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We're changing all the cameras to eight megapixels.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate a better deal.

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Surely.

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.

208
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So talking about purchasing, it's actually a very interesting position.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think many or almost all companies, big companies have this position where not only do they have to, maybe if they're in retailing, they have to purchase the goods that they will sell, but also in offices, for example, who buys the paper, the printers, the copiers, everything for the office.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And this is a very important position, as you say, because this person can save a company a lot of money if the person knows the right vendors.

212
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If the only vendors you know are selling things at very high prices, then that's not very good for you or for your business.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But if you know all the inside secrets, you know all the good vendors, then maybe you're going to be able to save a lot of money.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's right.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So I think this position is also a lot broader than just this.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So maybe someone can also help us out on the website, EnglishPod.com.

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can explain, maybe if you're a purchasing manager, you can tell us what your job entails.

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Or if you know a purchasing manager, what does that person do?

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We're very curious to know, and we hope that you'll be able to use some of these new words and phrases.

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you want to practice, check us out, EnglishPod.com.

222
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
All right.

223
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We'll see you guys there.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Bye.
