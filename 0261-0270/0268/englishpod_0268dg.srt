EnglishPod.com Good morning Angela, how have you been lately?

2
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:13,839
Morning Michael, I've been very busy lately.

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:18,780
One of our other vendors is going out of business and I've been searching for a suitable replacement.

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,359
Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run.

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,500
Please sit down.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:23,960
Coffee?

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,160
No thanks.

8
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,579
I've been trying to cut down on the caffeine.

9
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,760
I could never do that.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,600
I'd be a zombie if I didn't have my morning coffee fix.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,520
Let's get down to business then.

12
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:40,619
Yes, I've come to talk with you about ordering the 8 megapixel cameras for our new Mi Phone.

13
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,600
The demand for phone cameras is growing and Pear has been falling behind in the market.

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:46,820
That's great.

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,780
I'm glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon.

16
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:53,000
Right now our contract is for the 5 megapixel cameras.

17
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,060
Is Pear still interested in having those?

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,079
No, we're changing all the cameras to 8 megapixels.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,760
We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras, we could negotiate a better deal.

20
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:06,519
Surely.

21
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,980
Let's get started by drafting a new contract.
