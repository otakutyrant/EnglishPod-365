EnglishPod.com What seems to be the problem?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,820
I have a really bad toothache.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,240
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,899
Let's have a look.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,679
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,399
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,260
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,320
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,640
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,700
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,719
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,060
It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

13
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,780
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.
