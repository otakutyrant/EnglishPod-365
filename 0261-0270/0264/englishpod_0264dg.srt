EnglishPod.com What seems to be the problem?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I have a really bad toothache.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's have a look.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.
