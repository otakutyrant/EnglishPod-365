00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,640
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,419
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,939
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very painful lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:09,599
That's right.

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,580
Today we're going to go to one of the worst places for me.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to go to the dentist.

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:14,859
Okay.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:21,379
So the person in this dialogue has a pain in their mouth, in the tooth area.

9
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:26,320
So let's take a listen to this dialogue, and when we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about it.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,539
What seems to be the problem?

11
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,079
I have a really bad toothache.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,500
My cheek is swollen, and I can't eat anything.

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,140
Let's have a look.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,960
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,679
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,539
It's pressing against your molars, and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,600
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

18
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,920
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,980
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

20
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,000
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,340
It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,040
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic, and you won't feel a thing.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,620
All right, we're back, and obviously we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab related to going to the dentist and experiencing a little bit of pain.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,319
So let's take a look at that in Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,760
Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,739
Okay, first up in Language Takeaway today, we have the root of the problem.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,060
It's a toothache.

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,799
That's right.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,219
We have a really bad toothache.

30
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay, well ache means pain or soreness, and tooth is your tooth.

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,980
So I could say, oh gosh, I have a really bad toothache.

32
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:57,599
That's right.

33
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,079
That means your tooth or your teeth hurt.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
And basically you can combine it like a stomach ache or headache.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:05,700
Backache.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,439
Backache.

37
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,319
That's right.

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,400
So usually when you have a toothache, you experience different symptoms, different things happen to you.

39
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,719
What's one of these things, Marco?

40
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:17,080
Well, in this case, the girl had a swollen cheek.

41
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,659
Her cheek is swollen.

42
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,139
Ouch.

43
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,840
So the cheek is the side of the face.

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,180
It's usually where it's a little bit pink.

45
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,099
And when your cheek is swollen, it looks puffy.

46
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,680
It looks bigger than normal.

47
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,479
That's right.

48
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,639
So for example, sometimes you fall and you hurt your finger and it'll get fat and it'll get puffy, as you say.

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,460
It's swollen.

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,120
That's right.

51
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:36,879
So anything can be swollen, really.

52
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,319
When you hit your toe on something hard and your toe later gets bigger, it's swollen.

53
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

54
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:51,240
So obviously her cheek is swollen and she has a toothache because apparently her wisdom teeth, or her wisdom tooth, is coming out.

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,719
All right.

56
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,840
So wisdom teeth are special teeth.

57
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,199
I don't know if they actually have anything to do with wisdom, which means being smart.

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,860
To be wise.

59
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,439
Wise.

60
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,740
But wisdom teeth are those four teeth in the very, very, very back of your mouth.

61
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,400
That's right.

62
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,419
So these are the last teeth that come in or the last teeth that grow in your mouth.

63
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:13,419
So I think usually you're 18 or 20 when they come in.

64
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,120
That's right.

65
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,439
A lot of people experience these when they're older.

66
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,199
Maybe that's why they call them wisdom teeth, because you're older and you're wiser.

67
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,500
I had them when I was about 14, 13, so I was very young.

68
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,039
But these come in in the very back, they're the furthest away from your lips.

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,659
Okay.

70
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,819
Very good.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,460
So when they come in, sometimes there's not enough space and so they start to press against the other teeth in your mouth, specifically against your molars.

72
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:42,460
So molars are other teeth.

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,240
These are also in the back of your mouth.

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,719
You can tell which ones are molars, I believe, because they're flat on top, they look like a little square.

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,400
Those are the ones that you use to chew your food with, mostly.

76
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,000
Exactly.

77
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,719
They're not pointy like your front teeth.

78
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,979
And so molars are in the back of your mouth.

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,659
Wisdom teeth are in the very back of your mouth.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,039
And molars can be very sore when the wisdom teeth push against them.

81
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,580
And so in this case, you'll have to take your teeth out or the dentist will take your teeth out.

82
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,639
But what's something we say when we talk about taking the whole tooth out?

83
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:22,160
Well, in this case, he's going to extract the tooth, but also he's going to extract the nerve and the root.

84
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:23,240
Okay.

85
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:25,540
So nerves are parts of our bodies.

86
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,579
We can't see them, but they help us feel things.

87
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,980
So maybe when someone hits me, the nerves in my arm, they tell my brain that it hurts.

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,839
Well, we also have nerves in our teeth and that's what we're talking about here.

89
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,800
But what's this other thing?

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,939
You talked about the nerve and the root.

91
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,079
It's very similar to a plant.

92
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,500
For example, you consider that your teeth are like plants and they have little roots that go into your gums.

93
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,660
And this is how basically you get teeth stay alive.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,920
They are fed basically by your body.

95
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:56,399
All right.

96
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,519
So root, like with a tree or a plant is the very bottom of something.

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,500
And in this case to extract means to take out or to take away.

98
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,800
So the dentist will have to extract the root and the nerve.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,899
So that sounds pretty painful.

100
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,060
It's painful, but they have to do it, right?

101
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:21,579
So when the dentist has to extract the tooth, in this case, the nerve and the root and everything, in order for you not to feel it, he gives you special drugs.

102
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,620
What are these drugs called?

103
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,079
These are called anesthetics.

104
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:24,879
Okay.

105
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:31,959
So most people, when they are having major surgery, they get anesthetics so that they can't feel anything.

106
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,439
Remember, we were just talking about nerves.

107
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,899
Well, anesthetics make it so that you can't feel things through your nerves.

108
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,620
That's right.

109
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,819
So obviously you don't want to feel the pain when somebody's pulling that tooth out of your mouth.

110
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:47,699
So you get an anesthetic and then you don't really feel anything.

111
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,519
You kind of feel something, but you don't really feel pain.

112
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,420
Exactly.

113
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,560
So anesthetic basically makes you numb.

114
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:55,720
That's right.

115
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:56,519
That's the word, numb.

116
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:57,639
Okay.

117
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:03,300
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab, molars, wisdom teeth, et cetera.

118
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,839
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

119
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,079
What seems to be the problem?

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,600
I have a really bad toothache.

121
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,040
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

122
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,680
Let's have a look.

123
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:27,980
Hmm.

124
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,480
This doesn't look too good.

125
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,199
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

126
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,079
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

127
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:43,120
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

128
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,420
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

129
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,899
I also noticed a small cavity up front here.

130
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,500
So you are going to need a filling.

131
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,519
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

132
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,879
It could be that or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

133
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,579
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

134
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:12,500
All right, so the topic of today's lesson is toothache, but it's also basically about learning that you will have to have your tooth taken out.

135
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,920
So to say this, we say to pull out a tooth.

136
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,139
Okay, so that's what the dentist said.

137
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,680
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

138
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:21,759
Not good news.

139
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,759
Okay, so to pull out means to extract.

140
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,540
So just remember here, this is a phrase that has pull out.

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
Out would be the preposition here.

142
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,180
We wouldn't say pull off or pull out.

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,300
We'd say pull out.

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,160
Like, for example, you can pull out a hair or your hair.

145
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:37,660
Exactly.

146
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:38,220
Okay.

147
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,560
So we're pulling out the wisdom tooth and the dentist first wants to take some x-rays to see what we're dealing with.

148
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,500
Okay, so to deal with something means to work on it or to have something to do with.

149
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,439
And so in this case, the dentist wants to know, is this serious?

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,620
What are we dealing with here?

151
00:07:58,819 --> 00:07:59,120
That's right.

152
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,480
And so he's trying to judge the situation.

153
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,139
So maybe what would be another scenario or another situation where you would say, I have to see what we're dealing with?

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:19,740
Well, in the case of the weather and the newsmen who report about the weather, maybe they see that a storm is coming, but they have to look at the radars and the computer screens to see what they're dealing with.

155
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,680
Is it a serious storm or is it a very weak storm?

156
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,959
They have to evaluate.

157
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:25,800
That's right.

158
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,019
Okay, very good.

159
00:08:27,019 --> 00:08:28,839
And so we're going to see what we're dealing with.

160
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,080
And then the girl, I think, knows that she hasn't really taken good care of her teeth.

161
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,980
And so she says, I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth.

162
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:41,919
So that's what you get or that's what I get here.

163
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:48,559
The pronoun changes I, you, he, that's what I get for not taking care of myself.

164
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,100
This means it's my fault.

165
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,100
I deserved it.

166
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,240
I deserve this thing.

167
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:56,799
So I could say, Marco, that's what you get for not doing your homework.

168
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,679
You got a bad grade on your test.

169
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,220
That's right.

170
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:02,600
So it's basically a way of saying that's what you deserve.

171
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,379
That's the consequence for your actions.

172
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:05,519
Okay.

173
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,240
And what about our last phrase?

174
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,460
Well, this is something that I hate to hear from doctors and dentists because usually it's a lie.

175
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,720
A dentist will say before he gives you a shot or before he takes your tooth out, you won't feel a thing.

176
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,620
That's right.

177
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,360
So he's basically saying you're not going to feel any pain.

178
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,960
But why do we say you won't feel a thing instead of you won't feel anything?

179
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,539
It's just a set phrase.

180
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,320
It's something we say, I would remember it like this because it's more likely to be said in this way.

181
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,799
You won't feel a thing.

182
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,340
I think it basically means not even one little thing.

183
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,419
You're not going to feel that.

184
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,620
So for example, I'm about to fix someone's back, you know, when you have to pull them and make their back feel better.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
I say you won't feel a thing and you fix their back.

186
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,879
So you won't feel a thing or you won't feel anything.

187
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,519
Both are correct, but I think it's more common to hear you won't feel a thing.

188
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,419
Okay, so why don't we go back?

189
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:04,759
Let's take one last look at our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

190
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,659
What seems to be the problem?

191
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,240
I have a really bad toothache.

192
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,620
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

193
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,299
Let's have a look.

194
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,059
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.

195
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,779
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

196
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,659
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

197
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,700
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,019
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

199
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,100
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

200
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,139
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

201
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,419
It could be that.

202
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,460
Or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

203
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,179
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

204
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:06,899
All right, so talking about dentists and talking about wisdom teeth, you say that you still have all four wisdom teeth.

205
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,460
I do.

206
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,759
They're all still back there.

207
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:13,059
So you didn't need to have them taken out or pulled.

208
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:18,039
No, as my dentist likes to say, I have a big mouth, which in English has two meanings.

209
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,320
A big mouth is not just a large mouth, but also it means you like to talk a lot.

210
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:28,379
Did you ever have braces, for example, when you were a kid?

211
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:29,360
Oh, you had braces.

212
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:39,679
I had a retainer, which is a device that looks like a line across your teeth and you put it in usually at night, but sometimes during the day and it makes some space in your mouth.

213
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,600
But I also had braces after that.

214
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,559
I hated braces.

215
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,639
I had them for two years.

216
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,700
Why did you hate braces?

217
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,059
Because they're uncomfortable.

218
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:53,580
Well, they don't look very good, especially when you're a 13 year old girl and you want to look cute and you have this big metal thing in your mouth.

219
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,200
That's right.

220
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you have braces?

221
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,480
No, no, I never had braces.

222
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,159
Actually, it was kind of for a while.

223
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,440
I think a lot of people thought it was cool to have braces.

224
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,960
I did not grow up where you grew up.

225
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,779
It was not cool where I grew up.

226
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,360
I don't know.

227
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,320
I think it gets to a point where in certain parts, I guess my school was filled with kids that had braces.

228
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,059
So I guess everyone just had really bad teeth.

229
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,320
So obviously the people that didn't have braces kind of were left aside.

230
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,759
So you're like, oh, I want braces.

231
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:19,240
I want to be part of the group.

232
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,320
Kind of like sometimes I wish I had glasses because everyone I know has glasses.

233
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,279
Yeah.

234
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,539
If you have good vision though.

235
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,919
Yeah, it sucks to be perfect.

236
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,659
Well, this is a really interesting topic and going to the dentist is always complicated.

237
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,279
Maybe some of our listeners are dentists themselves or they have some stories that you can share with us.

238
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,100
Please let us know what you're thinking and share your dentist stories with us on EnglishPod.com.

239
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,059
We'll be waiting for you there.

240
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,419
All right.

241
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,039
We'll see you guys then.

242
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,419
Bye.
