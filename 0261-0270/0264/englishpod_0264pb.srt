00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very painful lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today we're going to go to one of the worst places for me.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to go to the dentist.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the person in this dialogue has a pain in their mouth, in the tooth area.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So let's take a listen to this dialogue, and when we come back, we'll be talking a little bit more about it.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What seems to be the problem?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have a really bad toothache.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My cheek is swollen, and I can't eat anything.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's have a look.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's pressing against your molars, and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic, and you won't feel a thing.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
All right, we're back, and obviously we're going to take a look at a lot of vocab related to going to the dentist and experiencing a little bit of pain.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So let's take a look at that in Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, first up in Language Takeaway today, we have the root of the problem.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's a toothache.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We have a really bad toothache.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, well ache means pain or soreness, and tooth is your tooth.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So I could say, oh gosh, I have a really bad toothache.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That means your tooth or your teeth hurt.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And basically you can combine it like a stomach ache or headache.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Backache.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Backache.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So usually when you have a toothache, you experience different symptoms, different things happen to you.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's one of these things, Marco?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, in this case, the girl had a swollen cheek.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Her cheek is swollen.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ouch.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So the cheek is the side of the face.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's usually where it's a little bit pink.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And when your cheek is swollen, it looks puffy.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It looks bigger than normal.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So for example, sometimes you fall and you hurt your finger and it'll get fat and it'll get puffy, as you say.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's swollen.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So anything can be swollen, really.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
When you hit your toe on something hard and your toe later gets bigger, it's swollen.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So obviously her cheek is swollen and she has a toothache because apparently her wisdom teeth, or her wisdom tooth, is coming out.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All right.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So wisdom teeth are special teeth.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know if they actually have anything to do with wisdom, which means being smart.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
To be wise.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Wise.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But wisdom teeth are those four teeth in the very, very, very back of your mouth.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So these are the last teeth that come in or the last teeth that grow in your mouth.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I think usually you're 18 or 20 when they come in.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A lot of people experience these when they're older.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe that's why they call them wisdom teeth, because you're older and you're wiser.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I had them when I was about 14, 13, so I was very young.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But these come in in the very back, they're the furthest away from your lips.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Very good.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So when they come in, sometimes there's not enough space and so they start to press against the other teeth in your mouth, specifically against your molars.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So molars are other teeth.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
These are also in the back of your mouth.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can tell which ones are molars, I believe, because they're flat on top, they look like a little square.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Those are the ones that you use to chew your food with, mostly.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Exactly.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They're not pointy like your front teeth.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so molars are in the back of your mouth.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wisdom teeth are in the very back of your mouth.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And molars can be very sore when the wisdom teeth push against them.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And so in this case, you'll have to take your teeth out or the dentist will take your teeth out.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But what's something we say when we talk about taking the whole tooth out?

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, in this case, he's going to extract the tooth, but also he's going to extract the nerve and the root.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So nerves are parts of our bodies.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We can't see them, but they help us feel things.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So maybe when someone hits me, the nerves in my arm, they tell my brain that it hurts.

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, we also have nerves in our teeth and that's what we're talking about here.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But what's this other thing?

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You talked about the nerve and the root.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's very similar to a plant.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
For example, you consider that your teeth are like plants and they have little roots that go into your gums.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And this is how basically you get teeth stay alive.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They are fed basically by your body.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So root, like with a tree or a plant is the very bottom of something.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And in this case to extract means to take out or to take away.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So the dentist will have to extract the root and the nerve.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So that sounds pretty painful.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's painful, but they have to do it, right?

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So when the dentist has to extract the tooth, in this case, the nerve and the root and everything, in order for you not to feel it, he gives you special drugs.

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are these drugs called?

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
These are called anesthetics.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So most people, when they are having major surgery, they get anesthetics so that they can't feel anything.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Remember, we were just talking about nerves.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, anesthetics make it so that you can't feel things through your nerves.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So obviously you don't want to feel the pain when somebody's pulling that tooth out of your mouth.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So you get an anesthetic and then you don't really feel anything.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You kind of feel something, but you don't really feel pain.

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Exactly.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So anesthetic basically makes you numb.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's right.

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's the word, numb.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab, molars, wisdom teeth, et cetera.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What seems to be the problem?

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I have a really bad toothache.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's have a look.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hmm.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This doesn't look too good.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I also noticed a small cavity up front here.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So you are going to need a filling.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It could be that or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
All right, so the topic of today's lesson is toothache, but it's also basically about learning that you will have to have your tooth taken out.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So to say this, we say to pull out a tooth.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, so that's what the dentist said.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Not good news.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay, so to pull out means to extract.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So just remember here, this is a phrase that has pull out.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Out would be the preposition here.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We wouldn't say pull off or pull out.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We'd say pull out.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Like, for example, you can pull out a hair or your hair.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Exactly.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we're pulling out the wisdom tooth and the dentist first wants to take some x-rays to see what we're dealing with.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, so to deal with something means to work on it or to have something to do with.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And so in this case, the dentist wants to know, is this serious?

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What are we dealing with here?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And so he's trying to judge the situation.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So maybe what would be another scenario or another situation where you would say, I have to see what we're dealing with?

154
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, in the case of the weather and the newsmen who report about the weather, maybe they see that a storm is coming, but they have to look at the radars and the computer screens to see what they're dealing with.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Is it a serious storm or is it a very weak storm?

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They have to evaluate.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's right.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, very good.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And so we're going to see what we're dealing with.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then the girl, I think, knows that she hasn't really taken good care of her teeth.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And so she says, I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So that's what you get or that's what I get here.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The pronoun changes I, you, he, that's what I get for not taking care of myself.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This means it's my fault.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I deserved it.

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I deserve this thing.

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I could say, Marco, that's what you get for not doing your homework.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You got a bad grade on your test.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So it's basically a way of saying that's what you deserve.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's the consequence for your actions.

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And what about our last phrase?

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, this is something that I hate to hear from doctors and dentists because usually it's a lie.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A dentist will say before he gives you a shot or before he takes your tooth out, you won't feel a thing.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right.

177
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So he's basically saying you're not going to feel any pain.

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But why do we say you won't feel a thing instead of you won't feel anything?

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's just a set phrase.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's something we say, I would remember it like this because it's more likely to be said in this way.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You won't feel a thing.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I think it basically means not even one little thing.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're not going to feel that.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So for example, I'm about to fix someone's back, you know, when you have to pull them and make their back feel better.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I say you won't feel a thing and you fix their back.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So you won't feel a thing or you won't feel anything.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Both are correct, but I think it's more common to hear you won't feel a thing.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay, so why don't we go back?

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's take one last look at our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What seems to be the problem?

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I have a really bad toothache.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
My cheek is swollen and I can't eat anything.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's have a look.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mmm, this doesn't look too good.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth.

196
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's pressing against your molars and that's one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.

197
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
When you pull my tooth, will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
First we will take some x-rays and see what we're dealing with.

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I guess that's what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It could be that.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or maybe you are eating too many sweets.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
In any case, I'll administer an anesthetic and you won't feel a thing.

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
All right, so talking about dentists and talking about wisdom teeth, you say that you still have all four wisdom teeth.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I do.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They're all still back there.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So you didn't need to have them taken out or pulled.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No, as my dentist likes to say, I have a big mouth, which in English has two meanings.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A big mouth is not just a large mouth, but also it means you like to talk a lot.

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Did you ever have braces, for example, when you were a kid?

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, you had braces.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I had a retainer, which is a device that looks like a line across your teeth and you put it in usually at night, but sometimes during the day and it makes some space in your mouth.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I also had braces after that.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I hated braces.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I had them for two years.

216
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why did you hate braces?

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because they're uncomfortable.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Well, they don't look very good, especially when you're a 13 year old girl and you want to look cute and you have this big metal thing in your mouth.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's right.

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Did you have braces?

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No, no, I never had braces.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Actually, it was kind of for a while.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think a lot of people thought it was cool to have braces.

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I did not grow up where you grew up.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was not cool where I grew up.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't know.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think it gets to a point where in certain parts, I guess my school was filled with kids that had braces.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I guess everyone just had really bad teeth.

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So obviously the people that didn't have braces kind of were left aside.

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So you're like, oh, I want braces.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to be part of the group.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Kind of like sometimes I wish I had glasses because everyone I know has glasses.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you have good vision though.

235
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, it sucks to be perfect.

236
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, this is a really interesting topic and going to the dentist is always complicated.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe some of our listeners are dentists themselves or they have some stories that you can share with us.

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Please let us know what you're thinking and share your dentist stories with us on EnglishPod.com.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We'll be waiting for you there.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All right.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We'll see you guys then.

242
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Bye.
