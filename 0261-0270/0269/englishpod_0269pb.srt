00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson about something very technical.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're talking about marketing strategies here today.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we have an upper intermediate lesson at the office.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That is the category of this lesson, and we're basically talking about marketing, a marketing plan, and a lot of technical words around this part of business.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All right.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in just a moment to talk about what's going on.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, everyone, let's begin.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wanted to reemphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees, and they are drawing in more customers.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We offer a superior product, and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They only care about price.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I disagree.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted, and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's true.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews, and it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Money is tight for everyone these days, so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right, we're back.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So a very interesting dialogue.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think this is something very common that would go on in a meeting room when the marketing department is talking about prices and how do we increase sales, et cetera.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I think we had a lot of difficult words, or maybe words that we didn't really understand well.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So let's take a look at some of those in Language Takeaway.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So the first word on the top of our list today is recession.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Anyone looking at the news this year or last year probably knows what this word means, but let's talk about it anyway.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is a recession?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So everyone was talking about the recession, and basically it is a noun, all right?

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And it means that people don't have enough money like before, and so consequently services are decreased, people aren't buying as much, so there is a lack of commerce going on in a country, a region, or a city, et cetera.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right, so basically in economics you have these different cycles.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not like the economy is always the same, and so sometimes when there's not enough money, we call it a recession and we can say, hey, I don't have much money to spend right now, we are in a recession.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So that's a very common way to use the term.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So as you said, it's an economic term and many consequences because of this lack of jobs.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's just, as you said, a cycle.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And so apart from a recession, that that's why they are brainstorming to see how they can increase sales despite the recession, they also talked about their customers and that their customers are highly discerning.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right, so this word, discerning, comes from the verb to discern, and it's a really important one because it means to be able to tell the difference, to understand the difference between two different things.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay, so let's say we have two cups of soda.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm very good at tasting things, so I can discern the difference.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can discern the difference between these two.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can say one is Coca-Cola and one is Pepsi.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, so to discern is to be able to tell the difference or to notice the difference between many things.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And so obviously you are a discerning person.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Or you have discerning taste.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This means that you're very good at telling when something is high quality and when it's not high quality.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And well, talking about discerning customers who know what they want, and so they talked about their coffee beans, and it's one of their core competencies.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, so this is something you might actually hear in education as well as in business.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Something is your competency if you are able to do it, all right?

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I am able to write Chinese characters.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's one of my core competencies.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, so that's something that I'm able to do, so I consider it one of these central or important abilities.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But you always talk about competencies within the context of some area.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So my language skills.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Or in this case, at a company, we're talking about making a coffee.

72
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
One of the company's core competencies is making their coffee beans.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's something they're good at.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's right.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And core, when we talk about core, we talk about the center.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We talk about one of the most important things.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's right.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And well, for the last word that we've prepared to you on Language Takeaway, we talked about them worrying that selling the coffee beans might undermine the essence of the company.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
To undermine.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, this is a really important verb, and you'll hear this a lot actually in TV shows and especially in dramas, say, he's undermining my authority or he's undermining my power.

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This means that someone is challenging it or someone is kind of taking it away from you.

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so to undermine is to, as you said, challenge or try to take something from you.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Very sneaky, in a sneaky way sometimes.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's right.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So for example, if I'm the president of a country and someone is trying to take that away from me, someone is trying to be the president and trying to take down my government, he is trying to undermine my power.

87
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, very good.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So four key words there on Language Takeaway.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay, now we're going to move on to Fluency Builder, where we've prepared a lot of nice and very good phrases.

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Fluency Builder.

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right, so on Fluency Builder, why don't we start up from the beginning of the dialogue when they were talking about the prices of the coffee and that other shops have reduced their prices and so they're drawing in more customers.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
All right, so the key here is to draw in.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is a phrase.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Most people will know the word to draw, you know, to make a design on a page.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But to draw in has a very special meaning.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It means to attract.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay, so you want to attract more customers.

98
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You want to bring them into the shop, so you're trying to draw them in.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So Marco, what's a good example of something that a company will do to try and draw in customers?

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
For example, many of you maybe have seen in fast food restaurants when they have a promotion, like you buy one hamburger and you get another one for free.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So that's maybe one of the strategies that they're trying to do to draw in customers and maybe not make money, but give people the opportunity to taste their good food.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
All right.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So the next phrase we've got here is a little bit different.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's talking about the kind of product that they have.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They're talking about their coffee beans and they say that they're roasted and that they use state of the art equipment to brew the coffee.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So this phrase, state of the art, what does this mean?

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If something is state of the art, we're usually talking about a machine and we're saying that it's the latest in technology.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's very, very new.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's highly advanced.

111
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a very technologically advanced machine.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So for example, the new iPhone 4 is a state of the art cell phone.

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That means it's the very highest that technology has to offer.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And obviously something that is state of the art is not state of the art forever because technology changes and so maybe next year there'll be a new state of the art telephone.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's right.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So if you notice the spelling as well, we have little hyphens between each word, state of the art, because we take it as a chunk altogether, right?

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's right.

118
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And following that, we have another phrase that is used to talk about products.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They say when you compare the coffees we have side by side, our coffee wins against our competitors.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So side by side.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

122
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The phrase there is side by side and they're talking about comparing coffees side by side.

123
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So I think this is pretty literal.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's basically saying you put two coffee mugs or coffee cups together side by side and you have people taste and then you see which one they prefer.

125
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So you can say this when you're making comparisons.

127
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When I look at them side by side, I think I like the pink one more than the red one.

128
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So you are comparing.

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And you are literally putting them next to each other to make a choice of which one is your preference.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Now moving on, we have a very interesting phrase when they were talking about the company and they've achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to best tasting brews.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So this phrase, top of mind awareness, very closely related to marketing.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What are we talking about here?

135
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, let's look at the individual words.

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We have top, which is on top, not on bottom, mind, which is your head or your thinking and awareness, which is the way that you see things.

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And so let's take a guess here and say that when I think of a category of product like coffee, for example, what is the first thing that comes into my mind?

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's right.

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So it's actually a very cool game that you can sometimes play with friends.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Basically just say, okay, when you think of coffee, what is the first brand that comes into your mind?

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Starbucks.

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Starbucks.

143
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So that, for example, shows that Starbucks has put in you a certain top of mind awareness.

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You associate coffee with Starbucks immediately.

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't say Costa Coffee, you don't say Coffee Bean or any other brand, right?

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No, yeah, no, definitely.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is a way for you to really test what companies, what corporations have the most effective marketing because obviously they're the ones who make you think of this thing.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Starbucks has tons of marketing campaigns.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's right.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So it's actually very interesting.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So you can say top of mind or you can say top of mind awareness.

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can say Honda has great top of mind among their clients or Ferrari has great top of mind among luxury vehicles.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That's right.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And now for the last phrase, when we talked about money again, this is a very nice colloquial way of saying that you don't have a lot of money or money is very scarce right now.

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
All right.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So the phrase is money is tight.

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
All right.

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So you know the word tight.

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can hold something tightly or this belt is tight.

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm gaining weight, but in this case money is tight.

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's a phrase we take as a chunk and it means like you say, Marco, I just don't have much money right now.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So money is tight right now.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Now it's interesting because you can say it money is tight and then the subject money is tight for bill right now or you can say bill is tight for money at the moment.

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So you can switch it up depending on where you put the subject, towards the end or in the beginning.

167
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's right.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So usually you hear the phrase money is tight right now or money is really tight, just kind of on its own.

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it's a way to say, yeah, I don't have much cash.

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's right.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay.

172
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and phrases here.

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay, everyone, let's begin.

175
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

176
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I wanted to reemphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees and they are drawing in more customers.

178
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors.

180
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales.

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

183
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They only care about price.

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I disagree.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places.

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks and we will not do so now.

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's true.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews and it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Money is tight for everyone these days, so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee.

194
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Alright, so going back to top-of-mind awareness, let's test what brands are in your head.

200
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Uh-oh.

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, so for example, when you think of a luxury sports car, what do you think?

202
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Ferrari.

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Ferrari.

204
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You mentioned it before.

205
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Or Lamborghini.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Or Lamborghini.

207
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But you said Ferrari first.

208
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
When you think of a brand of cigarettes, what do you think?

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Camel.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Camel?

211
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay, this is an American brand.

212
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't think it's found very commonly in other places.

213
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They have it in Europe.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's very popular in Europe.

215
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, really?

216
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yep.

217
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay.

218
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What about when you think of computers, what do you think?

219
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For some reason, IBM.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,000
IBM.

221
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Even though you don't own an IBM.

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't, but I grew up around the IBM revolution.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay, see, this is interesting.

224
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So actually, it doesn't always work that way, that because you have a brand in your mind, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will purchase it in the future if you have the power to.

225
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But at least you are aware of the brand and you recognize it.

226
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And the chances are that you will buy it.

227
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's right.

228
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And you're gonna be familiar with it when you read about it or when people talk about it.

229
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For example, I own a Mac computer, Apple.

230
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But when I think of computers, I just think of IBM because we used to say, remember, IBM compatible.

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Nah, that's right.

232
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
IBM compatible.

233
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Because before, it was usually just Mac.

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Everything was for Mac.

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Mac or IBM.

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And then all of a sudden, it's PC or Mac.

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Actually, that's interesting though because if probably, if I say, what do you think of when you think of what brand comes to mind when you think of MP3 players?

238
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Apple, the iPod.

239
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You probably think iPod.

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's probably one of the most famous ones.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But maybe if you ask somebody about 10 years ago, when you think about a music player, what do you think about?

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The Sony Walkman.

243
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The Sony Walkman, right?

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Or the Sony Discman.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's right.

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Had both.

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It was like I had a Walkman.

248
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It was bright yellow.

249
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So this is really interesting.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is the way that you see more or less.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You can start to realize what brands are in your mind and maybe unconsciously.

252
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You may not even be a smoker but maybe some sort of cigarette brand will be in your mind or maybe you don't even really like sports cars but you will have a sports car brand in your mind.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm very curious to hear what you guys have to say because obviously, the brands that we're aware of are dependent on where we come from and the marketing campaigns in our home countries and also our age.

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I was a teenager when I had the Sony Discman so that made an impact on me.

255
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But let's throw that out to you guys.

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let us know what you think of when we say luxury cars or MP3 players or computers.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Or maybe even basic things like detergents.

258
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
For example, if you ask somebody in the United States, they might say Tide.

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But if you ask somebody in South America, they might say, I don't know, Omo.

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's some type of brand.

261
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So this is also very interesting to see what your local brands have been doing.

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's right.

263
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So let us know what you're thinking.

264
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We're on EnglishPod.com.

265
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We hope to see you there.

266
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All right.

267
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Bye bye.
