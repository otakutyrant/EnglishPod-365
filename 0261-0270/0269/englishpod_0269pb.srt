00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,779
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,679
My name is Catherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson about something very technical.

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,060
We're talking about marketing strategies here today.

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:13,640
That's right.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,359
Today we have an upper intermediate lesson at the office.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:27,420
That is the category of this lesson, and we're basically talking about marketing, a marketing plan, and a lot of technical words around this part of business.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,000
All right.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,060
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in just a moment to talk about what's going on.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,880
Okay, everyone, let's begin.

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,740
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,679
I wanted to reemphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,119
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees, and they are drawing in more customers.

14
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,119
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,700
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors.

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,400
We offer a superior product, and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales.

17
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:15,219
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

18
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,719
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,200
They only care about price.

20
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,500
I disagree.

21
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:25,659
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places.

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,420
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted, and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees.

23
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,420
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,599
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,700
That's true.

26
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:49,620
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews, and it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

27
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,939
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

28
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:58,319
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

29
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:05,840
Money is tight for everyone these days, so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee.

30
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,939
Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

31
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:19,699
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?

32
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,599
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

33
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,379
The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

34
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,939
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

35
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,439
All right, we're back.

36
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,960
So a very interesting dialogue.

37
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:47,219
I think this is something very common that would go on in a meeting room when the marketing department is talking about prices and how do we increase sales, et cetera.

38
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:53,460
So I think we had a lot of difficult words, or maybe words that we didn't really understand well.

39
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,060
So let's take a look at some of those in Language Takeaway.

40
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,300
So the first word on the top of our list today is recession.

41
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,900
Anyone looking at the news this year or last year probably knows what this word means, but let's talk about it anyway.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,699
What is a recession?

43
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,419
That's right.

44
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,860
So everyone was talking about the recession, and basically it is a noun, all right?

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:34,520
And it means that people don't have enough money like before, and so consequently services are decreased, people aren't buying as much, so there is a lack of commerce going on in a country, a region, or a city, et cetera.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,020
All right, so basically in economics you have these different cycles.

47
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:48,599
It's not like the economy is always the same, and so sometimes when there's not enough money, we call it a recession and we can say, hey, I don't have much money to spend right now, we are in a recession.

48
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,780
So that's a very common way to use the term.

49
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,340
That's right.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,979
So as you said, it's an economic term and many consequences because of this lack of jobs.

51
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,300
It's just, as you said, a cycle.

52
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:12,960
And so apart from a recession, that that's why they are brainstorming to see how they can increase sales despite the recession, they also talked about their customers and that their customers are highly discerning.

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:24,540
All right, so this word, discerning, comes from the verb to discern, and it's a really important one because it means to be able to tell the difference, to understand the difference between two different things.

54
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,300
Okay, so let's say we have two cups of soda.

55
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,519
I'm very good at tasting things, so I can discern the difference.

56
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,079
I can discern the difference between these two.

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,540
I can say one is Coca-Cola and one is Pepsi.

58
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,959
Okay, so to discern is to be able to tell the difference or to notice the difference between many things.

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,459
And so obviously you are a discerning person.

60
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,740
Or you have discerning taste.

61
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:57,699
This means that you're very good at telling when something is high quality and when it's not high quality.

62
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:58,620
Okay.

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:09,060
And well, talking about discerning customers who know what they want, and so they talked about their coffee beans, and it's one of their core competencies.

64
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,980
Okay, so this is something you might actually hear in education as well as in business.

65
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,180
Something is your competency if you are able to do it, all right?

66
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:24,139
So I am able to write Chinese characters.

67
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,079
It's one of my core competencies.

68
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,060
Okay, so that's something that I'm able to do, so I consider it one of these central or important abilities.

69
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,519
But you always talk about competencies within the context of some area.

70
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,300
So my language skills.

71
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,680
Or in this case, at a company, we're talking about making a coffee.

72
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,660
One of the company's core competencies is making their coffee beans.

73
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,759
That's something they're good at.

74
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,379
That's right.

75
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,779
And core, when we talk about core, we talk about the center.

76
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,339
We talk about one of the most important things.

77
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,040
That's right.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,860
Okay.

79
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:08,579
And well, for the last word that we've prepared to you on Language Takeaway, we talked about them worrying that selling the coffee beans might undermine the essence of the company.

80
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,839
To undermine.

81
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:20,899
Okay, this is a really important verb, and you'll hear this a lot actually in TV shows and especially in dramas, say, he's undermining my authority or he's undermining my power.

82
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:26,379
This means that someone is challenging it or someone is kind of taking it away from you.

83
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:33,300
Okay, so to undermine is to, as you said, challenge or try to take something from you.

84
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,339
Very sneaky, in a sneaky way sometimes.

85
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:35,899
That's right.

86
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:48,939
So for example, if I'm the president of a country and someone is trying to take that away from me, someone is trying to be the president and trying to take down my government, he is trying to undermine my power.

87
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:50,420
Okay, very good.

88
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:53,779
So four key words there on Language Takeaway.

89
00:06:53,779 --> 00:07:00,240
Okay, now we're going to move on to Fluency Builder, where we've prepared a lot of nice and very good phrases.

90
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,879
Fluency Builder.

91
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:18,180
All right, so on Fluency Builder, why don't we start up from the beginning of the dialogue when they were talking about the prices of the coffee and that other shops have reduced their prices and so they're drawing in more customers.

92
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,420
All right, so the key here is to draw in.

93
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,300
This is a phrase.

94
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,100
Most people will know the word to draw, you know, to make a design on a page.

95
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,959
But to draw in has a very special meaning.

96
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,019
It means to attract.

97
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,139
Okay, so you want to attract more customers.

98
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,540
You want to bring them into the shop, so you're trying to draw them in.

99
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,839
So Marco, what's a good example of something that a company will do to try and draw in customers?

100
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:53,220
For example, many of you maybe have seen in fast food restaurants when they have a promotion, like you buy one hamburger and you get another one for free.

101
00:07:53,699 --> 00:08:02,819
So that's maybe one of the strategies that they're trying to do to draw in customers and maybe not make money, but give people the opportunity to taste their good food.

102
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:03,420
That's right.

103
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,899
All right.

104
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,759
So the next phrase we've got here is a little bit different.

105
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,879
It's talking about the kind of product that they have.

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:17,000
They're talking about their coffee beans and they say that they're roasted and that they use state of the art equipment to brew the coffee.

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,519
So this phrase, state of the art, what does this mean?

108
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:28,079
If something is state of the art, we're usually talking about a machine and we're saying that it's the latest in technology.

109
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:29,399
It's very, very new.

110
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,040
It's highly advanced.

111
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,259
It's a very technologically advanced machine.

112
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,879
So for example, the new iPhone 4 is a state of the art cell phone.

113
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,940
That means it's the very highest that technology has to offer.

114
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,759
And obviously something that is state of the art is not state of the art forever because technology changes and so maybe next year there'll be a new state of the art telephone.

115
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,480
That's right.

116
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,259
So if you notice the spelling as well, we have little hyphens between each word, state of the art, because we take it as a chunk altogether, right?

117
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,000
That's right.

118
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,879
And following that, we have another phrase that is used to talk about products.

119
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:11,340
They say when you compare the coffees we have side by side, our coffee wins against our competitors.

120
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,899
So side by side.

121
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,440
Okay.

122
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,659
The phrase there is side by side and they're talking about comparing coffees side by side.

123
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,860
So I think this is pretty literal.

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:31,240
It's basically saying you put two coffee mugs or coffee cups together side by side and you have people taste and then you see which one they prefer.

125
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:31,980
That's right.

126
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
So you can say this when you're making comparisons.

127
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,059
When I look at them side by side, I think I like the pink one more than the red one.

128
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,100
So you are comparing.

129
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,259
And you are literally putting them next to each other to make a choice of which one is your preference.

130
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:48,120
That's right.

131
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:48,679
Okay.

132
00:09:48,820 --> 00:10:00,179
Now moving on, we have a very interesting phrase when they were talking about the company and they've achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to best tasting brews.

133
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,980
So this phrase, top of mind awareness, very closely related to marketing.

134
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,779
What are we talking about here?

135
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,559
Well, let's look at the individual words.

136
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:14,679
We have top, which is on top, not on bottom, mind, which is your head or your thinking and awareness, which is the way that you see things.

137
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:25,340
And so let's take a guess here and say that when I think of a category of product like coffee, for example, what is the first thing that comes into my mind?

138
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,019
That's right.

139
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,799
So it's actually a very cool game that you can sometimes play with friends.

140
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,559
Basically just say, okay, when you think of coffee, what is the first brand that comes into your mind?

141
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,299
Starbucks.

142
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:38,820
Starbucks.

143
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,240
So that, for example, shows that Starbucks has put in you a certain top of mind awareness.

144
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,379
You associate coffee with Starbucks immediately.

145
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,940
You don't say Costa Coffee, you don't say Coffee Bean or any other brand, right?

146
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,080
No, yeah, no, definitely.

147
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:05,460
This is a way for you to really test what companies, what corporations have the most effective marketing because obviously they're the ones who make you think of this thing.

148
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:05,960
That's right.

149
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,759
Starbucks has tons of marketing campaigns.

150
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,519
That's right.

151
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
So it's actually very interesting.

152
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,120
So you can say top of mind or you can say top of mind awareness.

153
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:21,080
You can say Honda has great top of mind among their clients or Ferrari has great top of mind among luxury vehicles.

154
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:21,820
That's right.

155
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Okay.

156
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:32,740
And now for the last phrase, when we talked about money again, this is a very nice colloquial way of saying that you don't have a lot of money or money is very scarce right now.

157
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,360
All right.

158
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,240
So the phrase is money is tight.

159
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:35,840
All right.

160
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:36,659
So you know the word tight.

161
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,179
You can hold something tightly or this belt is tight.

162
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,980
I'm gaining weight, but in this case money is tight.

163
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,240
That's a phrase we take as a chunk and it means like you say, Marco, I just don't have much money right now.

164
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,700
So money is tight right now.

165
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:59,740
Now it's interesting because you can say it money is tight and then the subject money is tight for bill right now or you can say bill is tight for money at the moment.

166
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,980
So you can switch it up depending on where you put the subject, towards the end or in the beginning.

167
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,639
That's right.

168
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,299
So usually you hear the phrase money is tight right now or money is really tight, just kind of on its own.

169
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:14,059
And it's a way to say, yeah, I don't have much cash.

170
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:14,919
That's right.

171
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:15,460
Okay.

172
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,539
So we've taken a look at a lot of words and phrases here.

173
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,120
Let's listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

174
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,899
Okay, everyone, let's begin.

175
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,779
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

176
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,700
I wanted to reemphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

177
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,220
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees and they are drawing in more customers.

178
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,059
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

179
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,779
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors.

180
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:01,440
We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales.

181
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:05,259
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

182
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,759
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

183
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,259
They only care about price.

184
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:10,539
I disagree.

185
00:13:11,139 --> 00:13:15,720
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places.

186
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,480
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees.

187
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,460
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

188
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,659
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks and we will not do so now.

189
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:32,740
That's true.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,679
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews and it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

191
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,019
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

192
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:48,399
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

193
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:55,899
Money is tight for everyone these days, so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee.

194
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:03,000
Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

195
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:09,740
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?

196
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,659
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

197
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,440
The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

198
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,980
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.

199
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,919
Alright, so going back to top-of-mind awareness, let's test what brands are in your head.

200
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,500
Uh-oh.

201
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,860
Okay, so for example, when you think of a luxury sports car, what do you think?

202
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:38,820
Ferrari.

203
00:14:39,059 --> 00:14:39,419
Ferrari.

204
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,419
You mentioned it before.

205
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,259
Or Lamborghini.

206
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:41,919
Or Lamborghini.

207
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,940
But you said Ferrari first.

208
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,039
When you think of a brand of cigarettes, what do you think?

209
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:46,720
Camel.

210
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:47,440
Camel?

211
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:49,100
Okay, this is an American brand.

212
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,039
I don't think it's found very commonly in other places.

213
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:52,659
They have it in Europe.

214
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,320
It's very popular in Europe.

215
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,580
Oh, really?

216
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,000
Yep.

217
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,679
Okay.

218
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:58,139
What about when you think of computers, what do you think?

219
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,059
For some reason, IBM.

220
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:00,799
IBM.

221
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
Even though you don't own an IBM.

222
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,179
I don't, but I grew up around the IBM revolution.

223
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,320
Okay, see, this is interesting.

224
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:21,840
So actually, it doesn't always work that way, that because you have a brand in your mind, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will purchase it in the future if you have the power to.

225
00:15:22,179 --> 00:15:25,639
But at least you are aware of the brand and you recognize it.

226
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,639
And the chances are that you will buy it.

227
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,460
That's right.

228
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,480
And you're gonna be familiar with it when you read about it or when people talk about it.

229
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,799
For example, I own a Mac computer, Apple.

230
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,200
But when I think of computers, I just think of IBM because we used to say, remember, IBM compatible.

231
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:43,440
Nah, that's right.

232
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:44,240
IBM compatible.

233
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
Because before, it was usually just Mac.

234
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,500
Everything was for Mac.

235
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,539
Mac or IBM.

236
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,779
And then all of a sudden, it's PC or Mac.

237
00:15:51,799 --> 00:16:00,879
Actually, that's interesting though because if probably, if I say, what do you think of when you think of what brand comes to mind when you think of MP3 players?

238
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,879
Apple, the iPod.

239
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,059
You probably think iPod.

240
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,179
That's probably one of the most famous ones.

241
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:12,919
But maybe if you ask somebody about 10 years ago, when you think about a music player, what do you think about?

242
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,240
The Sony Walkman.

243
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,279
The Sony Walkman, right?

244
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:16,399
Or the Sony Discman.

245
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:17,059
That's right.

246
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,580
Had both.

247
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:19,879
It was like I had a Walkman.

248
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,799
It was bright yellow.

249
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:23,340
So this is really interesting.

250
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,100
This is the way that you see more or less.

251
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,399
You can start to realize what brands are in your mind and maybe unconsciously.

252
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:41,460
You may not even be a smoker but maybe some sort of cigarette brand will be in your mind or maybe you don't even really like sports cars but you will have a sports car brand in your mind.

253
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:53,460
I'm very curious to hear what you guys have to say because obviously, the brands that we're aware of are dependent on where we come from and the marketing campaigns in our home countries and also our age.

254
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,840
I was a teenager when I had the Sony Discman so that made an impact on me.

255
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,580
But let's throw that out to you guys.

256
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:08,880
Let us know what you think of when we say luxury cars or MP3 players or computers.

257
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,380
Or maybe even basic things like detergents.

258
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,880
For example, if you ask somebody in the United States, they might say Tide.

259
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,000
But if you ask somebody in South America, they might say, I don't know, Omo.

260
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:21,480
It's some type of brand.

261
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,680
So this is also very interesting to see what your local brands have been doing.

262
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:25,319
That's right.

263
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,940
So let us know what you're thinking.

264
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,140
We're on EnglishPod.com.

265
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,019
We hope to see you there.

266
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:30,420
All right.

267
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,119
Bye bye.
