EnglishPod.com Okay everyone, let's begin.

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,580
I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:19,539
I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission of aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,000
Several other shops have been reducing their prices for their coffees and they are drawing in more customers.

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,859
Why aren't we doing the same thing?

6
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:32,579
I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,240
We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term sales.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,060
If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,560
Customers don't care about coffee anymore.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,039
They only care about price.

11
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,340
I disagree.

12
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,520
Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,280
Our coffee beans are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,259
When you compare the coffees side by side, our coffee wins the taste test every time.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,439
We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,540
That's true.

17
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,480
We've certainly achieved top-of-mind awareness when it comes to the best tasting brews, and it's important to distinguish ourselves from the competitors.

18
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,799
I think the main question is, how can we show our appreciation to our customers?

19
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,180
That's the main question I would like to discuss today.

20
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:32,700
Money is tight for everyone these days, so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:39,799
Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies, why don't we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home?

22
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,560
That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,459
Let's brainstorm some more ideas and do some research.

24
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:53,219
The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets.

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,739
Maybe it's time we started selling coffee beans.
