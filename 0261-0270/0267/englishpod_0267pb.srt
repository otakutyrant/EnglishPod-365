00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an intermediate level lesson about going to the bank.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we're going to go to the bank, and we need to do something there.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're not going to put money in the bank, actually.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to make a transfer.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so you'll learn all about this in a minute.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue first.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Good morning.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
How may I help you today?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hi, I need to transfer some money to another account.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's urgent.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, I've never made a transfer before.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's all right.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will take you through the procedure.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A company account.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I need to pay a bill.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's address and phone number.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have all the information in this folder.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Well, you've come prepared.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I have all the necessary materials, so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a simple transaction, and we can process it today.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, that's such a relief.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you so much.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's my pleasure.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're back.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Interesting dialogue.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Very common situation.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We need to transfer money to another account.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have some very interesting vocab words right there.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Why don't we take a look at those on Language Takeaway?

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Marco, the first word is one that you've already said a couple of times in today's lesson.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It is to transfer.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We need to transfer money.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
To transfer, what is this verb?

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So to transfer means to move from one place to another.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In the case of money, you're moving money from one bank to another bank, or from one account to another account.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So just think of transferring as moving.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But the bank teller also mentioned something about a wire transfer.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So that's basically the same thing, right?

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So when you're talking about money, you don't actually take a bag of money and you don't walk to another bank to put it in the account.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A wire transfer means that the transfer is electronic.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
One bank tells another bank that you're going to exchange this money.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So it's going to move from one person to another person, or from one company to another company.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But it's never actually the money itself.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's always just the number of funds in the account.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So a wire transfer, to transfer money electronically from one account to another.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And talking about this word, account, we're talking about a bank account.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is this?

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, this is really important, even if you're not making a wire transfer, or if you're not working at a bank, this is something that most people have for their personal use.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So an account is a space for money in a bank that's kind of registered to one person or one company.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And there are many, many different kinds of accounts.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Many of you probably have a savings account.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is where you keep your money to save for the future.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Or many companies or people have a checking account, or a default account, where basically you put money in but you're also taking money out and paying for bills and paying to go to the movies, et cetera.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So these different accounts have different rules.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
They have rules about how much money you can keep in them or how much money you need to open them.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So the basic word here is account.

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And just remember that companies and people can all have accounts at a bank.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So when talking about an account, we're talking about transferring money to another account.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We don't say we want to transfer money.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We say we want to transfer funds.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Funds.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So funds, we usually say in the plural, funds with an S.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This means money.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we're talking about transferring funds from one company to another.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or I could say, I need to deposit funds in my account.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now, an interesting word because funds with an S at the end, that's a plural noun, as you said.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But if we use it in the singular, it could also be a verb, to fund.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And that means to pay for something or someone.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So my grandfather funded my college education.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He paid money for my college education.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's right.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So both words, either the verb or the noun, have to do with money.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And when we're talking about transferring money, we're talking about a type of transaction.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Right?

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A bank transfer or a wire transfer is a type of transaction.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So a transaction is a noun.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And it's something that you do at a bank, for example, usually involving the exchange of money.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So a wire transfer is a kind of transaction.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But also depositing or putting money into my savings account is also a kind of transaction.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So a transaction is kind of like a business move or a business deal involving money.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
For example, a transaction can also be buying a car.

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So the transaction is, I give my money to Marco, the car salesperson.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And the transaction is exchanging that money for the car.

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's right.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And lastly, since we needed to pay a bill, we were worried that the bill would be overdue.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And that's why we really needed to make this wire transfer.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So to be overdue is to be late.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So think about due.

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is the time when something has to be done by.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, for example, if the bill for the electricity is due on Wednesday, but I pay it on Thursday, it's overdue.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So it not only has to do with money, it could also be something that is late.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For example, if I visit my grandma after not going there for three months, you would say this visit is long overdue.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That means Marco should have visited his grandmother earlier, but he didn't.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So a lot of great vocab there, all involving banks and the different types of words you may find when transferring funds.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Good morning.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How may I help you today?

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hi.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I need to transfer some money to another account.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's urgent.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've never made a transfer before.

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's all right.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I will take you through the procedure.

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
A company account.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I need to pay a bill.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's address and phone number.

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have all the information in this folder.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, you've come prepared.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have all the necessary materials, so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a simple transaction, and we can process it today.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, that's such a relief.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you so much.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's my pleasure.

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
All right.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're back.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So we have three key phrases for you.

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So our first phrase comes from something that the person at the bank told the client.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That person said, it's all right.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will take you through the procedure.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So let's look at this word procedure.

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Procedure can be many different things, but what is it in this case?

163
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's basically the steps or the process of taking money from the account and transferring it to another one.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's the procedure.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What we have to do, all the steps, you have to fill out the paperwork, you have to sign here, and all these things.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Right.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we're talking about a wire transfer.

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So there is a procedure for doing a wire transfer.

169
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That means, like you say, there are steps that we have to go through to complete this action.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But we can also have a medical procedure.

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So heart surgery has its own procedure, but that's very different from a wire transfer procedure.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But still, it has different steps and different things that you must do in order to operate.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But when we have a bank teller who will take us through the procedure, this means that he or she will help us understand the steps we need to complete.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So we could also use this in another bank scenario if maybe my little brother wants to open a bank account.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I'm going to take him through the procedure of what he needs.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He needs to maybe get a copy of his ID, he needs to have $20, etc.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Take him through the procedure.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you're going to help him.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And after this, we find out why the person is so anxious to transfer this money.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The person says, I have a company account, I need to pay a bill.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So this is why the money is going to be transferred from one place to another, to pay the bill.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So this is something we say not just about, you know, company things or business things, we say about our things at home, like the electricity bill.

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And actually, this is more and more common, we pay our bills using our electronic banking services.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So for example, maybe he needs to pay the electricity bill or the telephone bill, and this is why we're transferring money.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So to pay a bill is to cancel the bill.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's right.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I could say, it's time to pay the bills, it's the end of the month.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or, oh, shoot, I forgot to pay the bills again, they're going to turn my electricity off.

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And now an interesting phrase here, very specific to making transfers, when we talk about bank routing number, a bank routing number.

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, this is pretty simple, actually.

195
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you're going to transfer money, you need to be able to tell the bank where the money will go.

196
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So you can't just say Mr.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Smith, you have to have a number for the account, and each number is unique, it's special, and it's usually very, very long.

198
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And actually, it also has to do with what bank it is, because obviously, you can't just say, oh, Bank of USA, because, you know, maybe there are two banks with the same name, or maybe there's one Bank of USA in the United States, and there's another one in, I don't know, in Europe.

200
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Right, so each bank will have a certain number or letter combination in the bank routing number, and so the kind of account, is it savings, or is it a business account, and so on and so forth, so that you know exactly where the money will go, because you don't want to give the money to the wrong person.

201
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, so a lot of great things on this lesson, why don't we listen to the dialogue for one last time.

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Good morning, welcome to Bank of the USA, how may I help you today?

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hi, I need to transfer some money to another account, it's urgent.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay, have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, I've never made a transfer before.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's alright, I will take you through the procedure.

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Are you transferring funds to a company, or an individual account?

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A company account, I need to pay a bill.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's address and phone number.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have all the information in this folder.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, you've come prepared.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have all the necessary materials, so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

214
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's a simple transaction, and we can process it today.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, that's such a relief.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I didn't want the payment to be overdue, thank you so much.

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's my pleasure.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So Marco, this is really, really important stuff, even if you're not talking about the business context, but you're trying to make transactions for your personal life.

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's right, just imagine maybe you're abroad, you're in the United States, and maybe your parents need to send you money.

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So maybe you need to go to the bank and receive those funds, so now you have the language and the vocab necessary to more or less talk about a bank transfer.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You can say, I was wired money from Spain, for example.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right, and one of the most famous places to do this, that you'll find all over the United States, is Western Union.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right, you can just go up to them and say, I need to transfer money, or I need to transfer funds.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And so they will send the money from one Western Union to another Western Union, and then the person at home or wherever will pick up your money.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And so they will wire the money from one place to another.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's right, and I think this is how it started, the wire transferring was, I don't think it was originally with banks, I think it was something, some sort of service similar to Western Union, or maybe Western Union started it.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It was like telegraphs?

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, something like this, but I don't know if it was from bank to bank.

229
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's an interesting story, though.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We'll have to look it up and let you know, I'm not sure of the story either, but if you're out there and you need to wire some money now you know how to do it, well, not how to do it, but you have to talk about it.

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
We hope you have luck with this, and if you have any questions, you know where to find us, EnglishPod.com.
