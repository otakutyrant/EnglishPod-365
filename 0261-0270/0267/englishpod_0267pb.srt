00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:03,319
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,800
My name is Catherine, and today we have an intermediate level lesson about going to the bank.

4
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:09,439
That's right.

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,179
Today we're going to go to the bank, and we need to do something there.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,140
We're not going to put money in the bank, actually.

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,800
We're going to make a transfer.

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,300
Okay, so you'll learn all about this in a minute.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,539
Let's take a listen to the dialogue first.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,559
Good morning.

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,699
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,079
How may I help you today?

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,899
Hi, I need to transfer some money to another account.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,659
It's urgent.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,659
Okay.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,039
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,560
No, I've never made a transfer before.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,920
It's all right.

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,579
I will take you through the procedure.

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,219
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,840
A company account.

22
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,920
I need to pay a bill.

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,060
Okay.

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,380
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's address and phone number.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,100
I have all the information in this folder.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
Well, you've come prepared.

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,480
I have all the necessary materials, so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,780
It's a simple transaction, and we can process it today.

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh, that's such a relief.

30
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:20,500
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,739
Thank you so much.

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,859
It's my pleasure.

33
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:27,239
All right.

34
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:27,760
We're back.

35
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:29,359
Interesting dialogue.

36
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,579
Very common situation.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,939
We need to transfer money to another account.

38
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,680
We have some very interesting vocab words right there.

39
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,159
Why don't we take a look at those on Language Takeaway?

40
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,560
Language Takeaway.

41
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,599
Marco, the first word is one that you've already said a couple of times in today's lesson.

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,840
It is to transfer.

43
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,579
Okay.

44
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,040
That's right.

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,640
We need to transfer money.

46
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:52,840
To transfer, what is this verb?

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,680
So to transfer means to move from one place to another.

48
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:03,439
In the case of money, you're moving money from one bank to another bank, or from one account to another account.

49
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,700
So just think of transferring as moving.

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,579
That's right.

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,719
But the bank teller also mentioned something about a wire transfer.

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,460
So that's basically the same thing, right?

53
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,219
That's right.

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,340
So when you're talking about money, you don't actually take a bag of money and you don't walk to another bank to put it in the account.

55
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,400
A wire transfer means that the transfer is electronic.

56
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,319
One bank tells another bank that you're going to exchange this money.

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,919
So it's going to move from one person to another person, or from one company to another company.

58
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,620
But it's never actually the money itself.

59
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,300
It's always just the number of funds in the account.

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,120
That's right.

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:36,680
Okay.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,500
So a wire transfer, to transfer money electronically from one account to another.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,020
And talking about this word, account, we're talking about a bank account.

64
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:46,740
What is this?

65
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Well, this is really important, even if you're not making a wire transfer, or if you're not working at a bank, this is something that most people have for their personal use.

66
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:01,860
So an account is a space for money in a bank that's kind of registered to one person or one company.

67
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,460
And there are many, many different kinds of accounts.

68
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,199
That's right.

69
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,680
Many of you probably have a savings account.

70
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:10,780
This is where you keep your money to save for the future.

71
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:21,759
Or many companies or people have a checking account, or a default account, where basically you put money in but you're also taking money out and paying for bills and paying to go to the movies, et cetera.

72
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:22,199
Yeah.

73
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,979
So these different accounts have different rules.

74
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,080
They have rules about how much money you can keep in them or how much money you need to open them.

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,360
So the basic word here is account.

76
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:35,000
And just remember that companies and people can all have accounts at a bank.

77
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:35,800
That's right.

78
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:36,500
Okay.

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,460
So when talking about an account, we're talking about transferring money to another account.

80
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,819
We don't say we want to transfer money.

81
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,659
We say we want to transfer funds.

82
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,000
Funds.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,819
So funds, we usually say in the plural, funds with an S.

84
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:50,840
This means money.

85
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,919
So we're talking about transferring funds from one company to another.

86
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,719
Or I could say, I need to deposit funds in my account.

87
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,400
That's right.

88
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:03,180
Now, an interesting word because funds with an S at the end, that's a plural noun, as you said.

89
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,060
But if we use it in the singular, it could also be a verb, to fund.

90
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:07,960
That's right.

91
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,620
And that means to pay for something or someone.

92
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,479
So my grandfather funded my college education.

93
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,040
He paid money for my college education.

94
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:17,660
That's right.

95
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:18,079
Okay.

96
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,839
So both words, either the verb or the noun, have to do with money.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,540
And when we're talking about transferring money, we're talking about a type of transaction.

98
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:28,240
Right?

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
A bank transfer or a wire transfer is a type of transaction.

100
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:33,019
That's right.

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,220
So a transaction is a noun.

102
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,420
And it's something that you do at a bank, for example, usually involving the exchange of money.

103
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,079
So a wire transfer is a kind of transaction.

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,600
But also depositing or putting money into my savings account is also a kind of transaction.

105
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:51,139
That's right.

106
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,819
So a transaction is kind of like a business move or a business deal involving money.

107
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:59,480
For example, a transaction can also be buying a car.

108
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,100
That's right.

109
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,539
So the transaction is, I give my money to Marco, the car salesperson.

110
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,339
And the transaction is exchanging that money for the car.

111
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,060
That's right.

112
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:08,860
Okay.

113
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,720
And lastly, since we needed to pay a bill, we were worried that the bill would be overdue.

114
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,160
And that's why we really needed to make this wire transfer.

115
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:17,800
Okay.

116
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,800
So to be overdue is to be late.

117
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,120
So think about due.

118
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,540
This is the time when something has to be done by.

119
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:32,579
So, for example, if the bill for the electricity is due on Wednesday, but I pay it on Thursday, it's overdue.

120
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,339
Okay.

121
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,740
So it not only has to do with money, it could also be something that is late.

122
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,660
For example, if I visit my grandma after not going there for three months, you would say this visit is long overdue.

123
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,180
That means Marco should have visited his grandmother earlier, but he didn't.

124
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,899
That's right.

125
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,720
Okay.

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,139
So a lot of great vocab there, all involving banks and the different types of words you may find when transferring funds.

127
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,180
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

128
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,439
Good morning.

129
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,620
Welcome to Bank of the USA.

130
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,000
How may I help you today?

131
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:13,680
Hi.

132
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,819
I need to transfer some money to another account.

133
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:16,579
It's urgent.

134
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,579
Okay.

135
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,959
Have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

136
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,800
No.

137
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,480
I've never made a transfer before.

138
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,839
It's all right.

139
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,500
I will take you through the procedure.

140
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,160
Are you transferring funds to a company or an individual account?

141
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,779
A company account.

142
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:31,839
I need to pay a bill.

143
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:32,980
Okay.

144
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,300
I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's address and phone number.

145
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,019
I have all the information in this folder.

146
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,500
Well, you've come prepared.

147
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,399
I have all the necessary materials, so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

148
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,699
It's a simple transaction, and we can process it today.

149
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,160
Oh, that's such a relief.

150
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,420
I didn't want the payment to be overdue.

151
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,660
Thank you so much.

152
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,860
It's my pleasure.

153
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:07,819
All right.

154
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,180
We're back.

155
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,980
So we have three key phrases for you.

156
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,860
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

157
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,319
So our first phrase comes from something that the person at the bank told the client.

158
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,060
That person said, it's all right.

159
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,720
I will take you through the procedure.

160
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,459
Okay.

161
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,579
So let's look at this word procedure.

162
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,360
Procedure can be many different things, but what is it in this case?

163
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,699
It's basically the steps or the process of taking money from the account and transferring it to another one.

164
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,680
That's the procedure.

165
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,019
What we have to do, all the steps, you have to fill out the paperwork, you have to sign here, and all these things.

166
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,420
Right.

167
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,240
So we're talking about a wire transfer.

168
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,680
So there is a procedure for doing a wire transfer.

169
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,019
That means, like you say, there are steps that we have to go through to complete this action.

170
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,860
But we can also have a medical procedure.

171
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,180
So heart surgery has its own procedure, but that's very different from a wire transfer procedure.

172
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,500
But still, it has different steps and different things that you must do in order to operate.

173
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,560
But when we have a bank teller who will take us through the procedure, this means that he or she will help us understand the steps we need to complete.

174
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,319
That's right.

175
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:22,259
So we could also use this in another bank scenario if maybe my little brother wants to open a bank account.

176
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
So I'm going to take him through the procedure of what he needs.

177
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,939
He needs to maybe get a copy of his ID, he needs to have $20, etc.

178
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,720
Take him through the procedure.

179
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,879
So you're going to help him.

180
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,740
That's right.

181
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:40,980
And after this, we find out why the person is so anxious to transfer this money.

182
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,379
The person says, I have a company account, I need to pay a bill.

183
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,100
So this is why the money is going to be transferred from one place to another, to pay the bill.

184
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:58,080
So this is something we say not just about, you know, company things or business things, we say about our things at home, like the electricity bill.

185
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:58,740
That's right.

186
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,279
And actually, this is more and more common, we pay our bills using our electronic banking services.

187
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:11,259
So for example, maybe he needs to pay the electricity bill or the telephone bill, and this is why we're transferring money.

188
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,600
So to pay a bill is to cancel the bill.

189
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,299
That's right.

190
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:18,100
So I could say, it's time to pay the bills, it's the end of the month.

191
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,759
Or, oh, shoot, I forgot to pay the bills again, they're going to turn my electricity off.

192
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:23,440
That's right.

193
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:33,059
And now an interesting phrase here, very specific to making transfers, when we talk about bank routing number, a bank routing number.

194
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,700
Well, this is pretty simple, actually.

195
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,279
If you're going to transfer money, you need to be able to tell the bank where the money will go.

196
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,740
So you can't just say Mr.

197
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:47,460
Smith, you have to have a number for the account, and each number is unique, it's special, and it's usually very, very long.

198
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,360
That's right.

199
00:09:48,879 --> 00:10:02,559
And actually, it also has to do with what bank it is, because obviously, you can't just say, oh, Bank of USA, because, you know, maybe there are two banks with the same name, or maybe there's one Bank of USA in the United States, and there's another one in, I don't know, in Europe.

200
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:16,039
Right, so each bank will have a certain number or letter combination in the bank routing number, and so the kind of account, is it savings, or is it a business account, and so on and so forth, so that you know exactly where the money will go, because you don't want to give the money to the wrong person.

201
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:16,860
That's right.

202
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,980
Okay, so a lot of great things on this lesson, why don't we listen to the dialogue for one last time.

203
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,120
Good morning, welcome to Bank of the USA, how may I help you today?

204
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,659
Hi, I need to transfer some money to another account, it's urgent.

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,059
Okay, have you made a wire transfer at our bank before?

206
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,620
No, I've never made a transfer before.

207
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,600
It's alright, I will take you through the procedure.

208
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:50,200
Are you transferring funds to a company, or an individual account?

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,940
A company account, I need to pay a bill.

210
00:10:53,759 --> 00:11:00,360
Okay, I'll need the name of the company and their bank routing number, as well as their bank's address and phone number.

211
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,120
I have all the information in this folder.

212
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,620
Well, you've come prepared.

213
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,480
I have all the necessary materials, so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now.

214
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,799
It's a simple transaction, and we can process it today.

215
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,220
Oh, that's such a relief.

216
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,740
I didn't want the payment to be overdue, thank you so much.

217
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:24,879
It's my pleasure.

218
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:34,600
So Marco, this is really, really important stuff, even if you're not talking about the business context, but you're trying to make transactions for your personal life.

219
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,419
That's right, just imagine maybe you're abroad, you're in the United States, and maybe your parents need to send you money.

220
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:48,539
So maybe you need to go to the bank and receive those funds, so now you have the language and the vocab necessary to more or less talk about a bank transfer.

221
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,299
You can say, I was wired money from Spain, for example.

222
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:57,639
Right, and one of the most famous places to do this, that you'll find all over the United States, is Western Union.

223
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:01,940
That's right, you can just go up to them and say, I need to transfer money, or I need to transfer funds.

224
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:09,379
And so they will send the money from one Western Union to another Western Union, and then the person at home or wherever will pick up your money.

225
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,059
And so they will wire the money from one place to another.

226
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:22,080
That's right, and I think this is how it started, the wire transferring was, I don't think it was originally with banks, I think it was something, some sort of service similar to Western Union, or maybe Western Union started it.

227
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,019
It was like telegraphs?

228
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:26,200
Yeah, something like this, but I don't know if it was from bank to bank.

229
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,419
It's an interesting story, though.

230
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:36,259
We'll have to look it up and let you know, I'm not sure of the story either, but if you're out there and you need to wire some money now you know how to do it, well, not how to do it, but you have to talk about it.

231
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,580
We hope you have luck with this, and if you have any questions, you know where to find us, EnglishPod.com.
