EnglishPod.com And those are today's top stories.

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,460
Now let's go to John for the weather.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,699
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,899
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,980
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,179
It will be drizzling all day today, and there's a 60% chance of thunderstorms this evening.

7
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:32,520
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,899
In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,259
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

10
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,899
Will it rain on Saturday?

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,619
Unfortunately, yes.

12
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:47,920
It will be clear early Saturday morning, but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day.

13
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:51,240
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,280
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls.

15
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,979
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

16
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,100
It gets better on Sunday, though.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,920
The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night.

18
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,840
It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s.

19
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:14,219
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out.

20
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,959
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,200
Back to you, Mary.

22
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,659
Thanks, John.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,819
And there you have it.

24
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:24,219
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.
