00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very, very useful intermediate level lesson for you all about the weather.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So obviously we have seen the news, and sometimes on the news we have the weather report.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So today we're going to learn all about that weather report in English.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So let's check out today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the words and phrases that those weather forecasters used.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And those are today's top stories.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now let's go to John for the weather.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It will be drizzling all day today, and there's a 60% chance of thunderstorms this evening.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Will it rain on Saturday?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Unfortunately, yes.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It will be clear early Saturday morning, but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record-high rainfalls.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It gets better on Sunday, though.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The storm systems move east, and the skies will clear up at night.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Back to you, Mary.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thanks, John.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And there you have it.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
All right, we're back, so apparently they're not going to have great weather this weekend, and they actually started with an interesting word.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And actually, the commentator started with asking the weatherman, John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, so the word here, forecast, is very, very important because it describes this part of the newscast.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A forecast is basically a prediction, or a description of the future weather situation.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So we're talking about the weather forecast.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now it's very interesting because we can also use that in business, for example, in budgets.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can say, what is the financial forecast of the company?

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right, so you can't know what will happen, but you can predict it, and that's what a forecast is.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So we're talking about the weather forecast, and the weatherman said that, well, there are some storms coming, and it will be drizzling all day.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, so to drizzle is a verb, and it's like the verb to rain, except it's less by degree.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's very light rain.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah, it's kind of like if I spray you with water, a spray can or something, it's like drizzle.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's just little dots of water.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's not like you're getting wet.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You don't really have the normal, heavy raindrops.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You just have a little bit of water coming down.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But it's annoying, because do you bring your umbrella, do you leave your umbrella, so drizzling is a kind of rain that's very, very light.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right, so it's going to drizzle all day, and the weatherman also said that we might have some thunderstorms.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, so thunderstorms are very different.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Thunderstorms are a kind of storm where there is thunder, so thunder is the loud noises when there's lightning.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Lightning, okay.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So lightning is like the flash that you get from the sky, and thunder is the hard sound that comes after.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The boom.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, so remember, light, lightning.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Light is the light that comes down from the sky, lightning, and thunderstorms are just those loud noises that the lightning makes.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So usually with thunderstorms, we have very heavy rain.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right, and that's why it's different from drizzling, which is very light.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, now we're talking about water.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We have drizzle, we have thunderstorm.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now what about a shower, because the weatherman said there is a high chance of showers.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, yes, there's a high chance of showers.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I take showers every day, thank you very much, but that's not the kind of shower we're talking about here, is it?

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Think about it, though.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's similar.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
A shower, when you wash yourself, is water coming down on top of you.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, in this case, it's a rain shower, so it's rain that's happening.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, so it's rain water that's coming down, very similar to the shower that you take in the morning.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The difference, though, is that a shower is a noun, and to rain is a verb.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So it will rain tomorrow, or we expect showers tomorrow.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Both mean the same thing.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
All right, very good.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And well, talking about showers and thunderstorms, there's also another type of water that falls from the sky.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is called hail.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay, so hail is difficult to describe, because it's like ice, but it's not really.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's just usually hard, almost like marbles, like hard balls of rain that come down.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's not snow.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It hurts when it hits you.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sometimes it's very big, sometimes it's very small, but it's heavy, hard things that come out of the clouds.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, so just think about it.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's very, very similar to ice.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's small pieces of ice coming down from the sky.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So that's hail.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But obviously very different from snow, because as we said, it's hard.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Snow is very soft.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And well, with this type of weather going on on the weekend, the commentator said, wow, that certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, dreary is a great word to describe it.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So as you can tell, it's going to rain.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Dreary is not a good thing.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not a happy thing.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So something is dreary when it's not very exciting.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It looks like it'll be dull or sad or boring or dark.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Now can you describe a person like this as well?

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes, he's a very dreary person.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's never optimistic.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He's always down and yeah, kind of quiet and sad and down.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Boring.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, so that's what it means.

106
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Something that's boring, not very exciting or very calm.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But also dark.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There's a dark element to it because something is dreary.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There's no sunshine.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There's no light.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There's no optimism.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So you can say it's a dreary day.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, very dreary day today.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No light, no sunshine.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, very good.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We've taken a look at a lot of vocab there.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why don't we review what we've just learned and listen to the dialogue again?

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And those are today's top stories.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now let's go to John for the weather.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It will be drizzling all day today and there's a 60% chance of thunderstorms this evening.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In the Midwest expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Will it rain on Saturday?

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Unfortunately, yes.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the southeast.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It gets better on Sunday though.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It will still be rather cool with highs in the low 50s.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather but at least the sun will come out.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Back to you, Mary.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Thanks, John.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And there you have it.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, we're back.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So now we're going to talk a little bit about some phrases that we've chosen for you on Fluency Builder.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So when we're talking about forecasts, remember that we're talking about things that aren't certain.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We have to explain that there is a possibility of rain or a possibility of sunshine and usually in the weather report they will use percentages to describe how likely something is to happen.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The weatherman said there is a 60% chance of thunderstorms.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay, so 60% is not very likely but it's also not unlikely.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It means that it might happen that it rains.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's right.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So as you said, it's a way to measure what the probabilities are.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Because imagine if the weatherman says it might rain tomorrow, you're like, well, maybe it really will or maybe it's very unlikely that it won't or we don't really know.

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Exactly.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So for example, if the weatherman says there's a 95% chance of rain tomorrow, do you bring your umbrella?

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What if he says there's a 5% chance of rain tomorrow?

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So you have to think about the probability.

159
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
60%, it's maybe half and half.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But 95%, it's very likely to happen.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And he also mentioned that there's a high chance of thunderstorms or maybe you can say there's a low chance of hail.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So he's basically saying, he or she is basically saying, you know, it's possible that this will happen or it's not likely this will happen.

165
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They're just trying to help you out.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They can't say this will happen because they don't know.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So the word for probability here, the key word is chance.

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There is a good chance that it will rain.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So chance is probability.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Right.

172
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So for example, what's the chance it will rain tomorrow?

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, there's a high chance.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Very good.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And now when we talk about the degrees or how warm or cold it is, so we express it in Fahrenheit in some countries or in other countries in centigrade.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Here we talk about 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But the weatherman also says highs and lows.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's a low of around 40 degrees.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What does he mean a low?

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is a really important part of the forecast because you need to know, will you have to bring a coat tomorrow?

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Is it going to be hot or cold?

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And so you think about a day, usually during the day at noon or one o'clock in the afternoon, it's the hottest.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But at night, it's the coldest.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And so the low refers to the lowest temperature and the high refers to the highest temperature.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So for example, in the fall, maybe the highs are 60 degrees, but the lows are 40.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So you should bring a coat.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It means at night it'll be 40, during the day it'll be 60.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay.

192
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So we're talking about the highs are the highest temperatures or the highest number that we'll get.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And the lows is the lowest.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So the weatherman will commonly say, tomorrow we'll experience a high of 32 degrees and a low of 25.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right.

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So it's very easy to understand that the temperature during the day will be between these two numbers.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right.

198
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Very good.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay.

200
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And for our last phrase, the weatherman also said that there is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the southeast.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
All right.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So Marco, this is a really key phrase because it is, it's telling people about potential danger.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You know, a thunderstorm can be very dangerous, so you want to stay inside.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So a severe thunderstorm warning, severe means very, very serious, is something you should pay attention to.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

206
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But now the interesting thing is that we can change the noun, in this case thunderstorm, and we can talk about, for example, a severe tornado warning.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
All right.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So if there's a severe tornado warning, then I really have to pay attention to the weather and be careful not to go outside.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or even a severe flood warning.

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You need to know that the streets might become flooded and prepare.

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So they're saying that there's a very high probability that this might happen, so they're warning you to take precaution.

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,000
All right.

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So pay attention to that last one, and we're going to listen to today's dialogue one more time.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We'll be back in a moment to talk a little bit more about the weather.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And those are today's top stories.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Now let's go to John for the weather.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm afraid we're in for a rough weekend, Mary.

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There's a storm system moving through the East Coast.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It will be drizzling all day today, and there's a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening.

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It will be warm and humid all weekend.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's pretty chilly for the summer.

224
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Will it rain on Saturday?

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Unfortunately, yes.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It will be clear early Saturday morning, but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast.

228
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls.

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It gets better on Sunday, though.

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The storm systems move east, and the skies will clear up at night.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s.

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out.

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Back to you, Mary.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Thanks, John.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And there you have it.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Looks like it's a weekend to stay at home.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Alright, so talking about the weather, it always seems like the weatherman is always wrong.

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Always.

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's like the opposite of what should happen.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's right.

243
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But you know, you can't blame them, because all they have is a computer and some sensors, and they have to guess about the weather and help people figure out what to do.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Have you ever experienced anything severe, like a hard thunderstorm or maybe a tornado or something like this?

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have, actually, because I'm from Chicago, and in America, the middle of the country is called the tornado belt.

246
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That means it's a piece of land where tornadoes are very common.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And so in the fall and in the spring, we often have tornadoes, and I've been in a couple tornadoes myself.

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, wow.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Have you seen them?

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

251
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is it amazing to see?

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They're very scary.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're always running inside and locking yourself in the basement.

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's very important to protect yourself in a tornado, because it's very dangerous around the area of the tornado, because the wind is so strong that trucks and cars and telephone poles and big, big heavy objects can fly through the air and hurt people.

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And that's how most of the damage happens.

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay, so this is interesting, because a tornado is also considered a natural disaster.

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, it is.

258
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's a weather phenomenon, whereas earthquakes are a natural disaster, but it's not part of the weather.

259
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, yeah, you're right.

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's not something that it sweeps in and it leaves.

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Like a flood, for example, all of the rain will come down and it will create a flood.

262
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
An earthquake is a natural disaster that's not weather-related.

263
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's right.

264
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay, interesting thing.

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So maybe some of our listeners that live in a very cold area have experienced a heavy snowstorm.

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Like a blizzard.

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like a blizzard.

268
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Or maybe people in a tropical area have experienced a hurricane.

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So let us know if you've ever been in one of these weather-related phenomenons.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And also if you have any comments or questions, we're always at EnglishPod.com.

271
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We hope to see you guys there.

272
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Bye.

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Alright, bye.
