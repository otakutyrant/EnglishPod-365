00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,300
My name is Kathryn, and today we're talking about where people come from or nationalities.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,199
That's right.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:22,780
Many people come from many different countries, just like our listeners, and there are specific words or adjectives and nouns to describe people, like, for example, somebody who is from China.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,500
A Chinese person.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,699
That's right.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,719
So, in your case, Marco, you are an Ecuadorian.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,640
That's right.

10
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,000
So, that means I come from the country Ecuador.

11
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,079
I, on the other hand, am an American.

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,520
I come from America.

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,200
That's right.

14
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,679
So we have a lot of these examples.

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,359
Why don't we jump into the dialogue?

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,939
Let's see where all of the people from this international class are from, and we'll be back to talk about it.

17
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:56,960
Hey, how was your first day of class?

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,520
Yes, I'm on level two, and I'm loving my class this semester.

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,179
It's great being in a class of international students.

20
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:07,120
Mine was okay, except that no one in my class speaks English.

21
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,560
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class, so at least I should improve a lot this semester.

22
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:16,099
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

23
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:18,180
It's the United Nations in my class.

24
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:20,420
We have people from all over the world.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:31,540
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scott, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,879
Who else do we have?

27
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:38,200
Oh, we have a Moroccan, a Tagolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,379
That's quite the array of nationalities.

29
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,459
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

30
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:56,260
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

31
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,560
Well, I think you're pretty lucky, actually.

32
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,280
You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:08,099
I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I think I might change classes.

35
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,219
Don't!

36
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,000
Stay the course.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,199
Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,439
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,560
I highly doubt it.

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,819
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,360
Well, there is that, yes.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,580
So the student jokes that their class is kind of like the United Nations.

43
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,620
So it does sound like it.

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,520
We have so many different nationalities that we're going to look at them in two groups today.

45
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:50,379
But the United Nations, as you know, is a political group that has people from all over the world who make decisions about politics and the environment, things like that.

46
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:51,080
That's right.

47
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,000
So why don't we take a look at these nationalities now on Language Takeaway.

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,879
The first few are from Europe.

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,379
So these are some European nationalities.

50
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,740
We've got German.

51
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,020
Where is a German from?

52
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,719
A German is from Germany.

53
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,960
Okay, so next to Germany we have another country, Poland.

54
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,819
What do we call a person from Poland?

55
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,000
You call that person a pole.

56
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,240
So is this for a woman and a man, or is this just one gender?

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,240
Yeah, it's for both.

58
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,400
Okay, so pole.

59
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,060
Yeah, a girl that's from Poland would be also a pole.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,319
Now someone that comes from Scotland, on the other hand.

61
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:32,000
That would be a Scott.

62
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,159
Or if it's a man, a Scotsman.

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,300
Scotsman, okay.

64
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,039
Now this is interesting because we are mentioning the nouns of these nationalities, like for example German.

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,659
Now when we took a look at pole from Poland, what would be the adjective?

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,919
Do I say I am pole?

67
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,979
I am Polish.

68
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,159
Or if you want to use the noun, I am a pole.

69
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,879
But the adjective can be used for things as well.

70
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,219
I love to eat Polish sausages.

71
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:05,699
Okay, or for example something from Scotland, you can say I love Scottish whiskey.

72
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,180
Or I love Scottish kilts, those skirts.

73
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,280
So that's the adjective.

74
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,240
But in the case of France, the country France, we have to say as a noun, he is a Frenchman.

75
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,060
Okay, and if it's a woman, a French woman.

76
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,639
That's right, or in the case of an adjective, I love to eat French bread.

77
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,620
Okay, now moving on to South America, we took a look at a Brazilian and a Chilean.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,740
Okay, so Brazil, Brazilian.

79
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,379
In this country there are many Brazilians.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,199
And Chile, or Chile, as many Americans say, has people called Chileans.

81
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,759
Some people say Chilean, so I don't know, I guess the accent varies a little bit.

82
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,540
Now why don't we move back to the other side of the world, we have a New Zealander.

83
00:04:55,179 --> 00:05:04,839
Alright, so many of you have heard of Australia, maybe New Zealand is not as famous, it's a small country near Australia, and the people who come from there are called New Zealanders.

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,319
It's very hard to say those sometimes, especially when we have to use the adjective New Zealand.

85
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,500
That's right, so the student said he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

86
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:23,920
Alright, so Kiwi was a special kind of bird that could only be found in New Zealand, and so this became a very popular symbol for New Zealand.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,000
And now people from New Zealand call themselves Kiwis, so I could say I have many Kiwi friends.

88
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,259
That's right, okay, Kiwis.

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,800
So now if we go to the African continent, we have Moroccan and Togolese.

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,480
So Morocco is in North Africa, and a person who comes from there is Moroccan.

91
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,699
You can also say I like to eat Moroccan food, which is very popular.

92
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:51,120
But when we talk about the country Togo, what do we call a person from that country?

93
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,980
Togolese.

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,079
Togolese.

95
00:05:53,079 --> 00:06:01,240
So it's Togo, that's the way you pronounce it, because if you look at it, I would say to go, right, but it's not to go, it's Togo.

96
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,019
Or as my French speaking friends would say, Togo.

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,139
That's right.

98
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:08,620
Alright, so that's our first set of nationalities.

99
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,620
Let's listen to today's dialogue one more time, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss the other nationalities.

100
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,579
Hey, how was your first day of class?

101
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm on level two and I'm loving my class this semester.

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,779
It's great being in a class of international students.

103
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,699
Mine was okay, except that no one in my class speaks English.

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,160
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class, so at least I should improve a lot this semester.

105
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,699
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,779
It's the United Nations in my class.

107
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
We have people from all over the world.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,120
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scott, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

109
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,500
Who else do we have?

110
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh, we have a Moroccan, a Tagolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

111
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,980
That's quite the array of nationalities.

112
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:12,060
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

113
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:23,879
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

114
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,160
Well, I think you're pretty lucky, actually.

115
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,879
You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

116
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:35,699
I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier.

117
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:38,000
I think I might change classes.

118
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:38,819
Don't!

119
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:39,620
Stay the course.

120
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,800
Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful.

121
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,040
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

122
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,220
I highly doubt it.

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,399
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

124
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,980
Well, there is that, yes.

125
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,500
All right, we're back.

126
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,500
So now we have more nationalities prepared for you, so let's take a look at those now on Language Takeaway Part 2.

127
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,100
We're in Asia for this part of today's lesson, so we're going to start with a country called Pakistan.

128
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,620
What do we call the people from Pakistan?

129
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,399
We say they are Pakistani.

130
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:25,740
Okay, so in Chicago, for example, there are many Pakistanis.

131
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,860
Okay, and moving on to Southeast Asia, we have Indonesians.

132
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:36,399
All right, Indonesia is the country, and people who come from there are Indonesian.

133
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:37,740
Okay, very good.

134
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,860
Now if we go back to the North part of Asia, we have South Koreans.

135
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,179
So we have North and South Korea on our maps.

136
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:50,340
A person from North Korea is North Korean, and a person from South Korea is South Korean.

137
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,700
It's kind of like that same structure, American, Brazilian, Korean.

138
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:55,600
Very good.

139
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,240
And moving to the island of Japan, we have Japanese.

140
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:08,039
So this is an adjective, we're talking about a Japanese person, he is Japanese, or we can also talk about the food, like sushi is Japanese food.

141
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:08,759
That's right.

142
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,259
Okay, moving back to Southeast Asia again, we have Malaysia.

143
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,179
So people from Malaysia are called Malaysian.

144
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,419
Okay, again with this pattern, Malaysian, Korean.

145
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:21,659
That's right.

146
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,379
And I think you say Malaysian food, or you say Malay.

147
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,779
I've heard some people say Malay.

148
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:34,000
I've said Malaysian food generally, but Malay I think is one of the languages, and I think it's an ethnic group as well.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,320
So you can have Malay people in Singapore, for example.

150
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:37,879
Okay.

151
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,799
And actually we have Thai people and Singaporeans.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,759
So we have two countries there, Thailand and Singapore.

153
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:49,860
So Thai is the adjective to describe things that come from Thailand.

154
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,159
It's kind of unusual, it doesn't fit that pattern that I mentioned, but it's a very important one to remember if you like to eat food from this country, Thai food.

155
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,440
Yeah, excellent food.

156
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,179
And Singaporean food is also pretty good, and people from Singapore are also called Singaporean.

157
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,639
Here we've got a very tricky one.

158
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,600
We've got the country, the Philippines.

159
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,000
What do you call a person from the Philippines?

160
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,740
So the Philippines is actually spelled P-H-I, like Philippines, right?

161
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:21,360
But if somebody is from the Philippines, we say Filipino with an F.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All right, Filipino.

163
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:36,440
This is interesting, especially for people who are native Spanish speakers, because the Philippines was a Spanish colony for a very long time, and so you might hear someone refer to himself as a Filipino, he's a man, or if she is a woman, a Filipina.

164
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,460
So this is very similar to the Spanish structure of having a gender on the end of the word.

165
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,399
That's right.

166
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,220
And well, now we're moving on to Kazakhstan and Russia.

167
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,220
We have people that are from Kazakhstan and Russia, and we say they are Kazakhstani.

168
00:10:51,220 --> 00:11:02,840
So this is very common in that part of the world, to end the adjective in an I, like Afghanistan, Afghani, Pakistan, Pakistani, Kazakhstan, Kazakhstani.

169
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,419
And so these are the stands, the former U-S-S-R.

170
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:06,980
That's right.

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,179
So this is a very important structure to remember, but Russia is pretty easy.

172
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,419
Yeah, people from Russia, you say they are Russian, or you have Russian food.

173
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,440
I love Russian food.

174
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,799
All right, so we have a lot of different nationalities there, and obviously we didn't cover all of them, I think, I don't know, maybe 200 nationalities.

175
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:31,740
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more about this really interesting topic.

176
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,259
Hey, how was your first day of class?

177
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,779
I'm on level two, and I'm loving my class this semester.

178
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,419
It's great being in a class of international students.

179
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,419
Mine was okay, except that no one in my class speaks English.

180
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,820
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class, so at least I should improve a lot this semester.

181
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,360
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

182
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,460
It's the United Nations in my class.

183
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,679
We have people from all over the world.

184
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:13,799
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scott, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

185
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,179
Who else do we have?

186
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:20,460
Oh, we have a Moroccan, a Tagolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

187
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,639
That's quite the array of nationalities.

188
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,740
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

189
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:38,539
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

190
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:40,840
Well, I think you're pretty lucky, actually.

191
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,539
You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

192
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:48,200
I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates.

193
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,659
Especially with the language barrier, I think I might change classes.

194
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,460
Don't!

195
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,259
Stay the course.

196
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,480
Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful.

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,679
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

198
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,820
I highly doubt it.

199
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,039
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

200
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,559
Well, there is that, yes.

201
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,860
All right, we're back, so talking about nationalities, I think there's one that we didn't mention that's very, very popular.

202
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,240
People from Ireland.

203
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,440
Okay, so people from Ireland are called Irish.

204
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,179
Irish.

205
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:25,360
The Irish, or Irishmen.

206
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,840
This is a similar structure to a lot of those countries in Northern Europe, like Sweden and Finland.

207
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,179
That's right, so somebody from Sweden would be called Swedish.

208
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,059
Or a Swede is the noun, so I love to eat Swedish food like salmon.

210
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,779
But the similar structure applies to Finland.

211
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,379
In Finland, they're very famous for their Finnish bread.

212
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,059
Finnish, so that's the way that you say Finnish, double N, right?

213
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,960
That's right, it's not like I finished my homework, it's like F-I-N-N-I-S-H, Finnish.

214
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,779
And now, what about people from Denmark?

215
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,419
They are Danish.

216
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:05,879
Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,379
And what about people from Norway?

218
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,799
They are Norwegian, so that's one that does not fit the pattern.

219
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:14,679
And this is a very interesting one that also doesn't fit the pattern at all.

220
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:15,980
People from Holland.

221
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,820
Okay, so Holland as a country has two names.

222
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,639
We sometimes say Holland, we sometimes say the Netherlands.

223
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,320
But a person who comes from Holland is called Dutch.

224
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,620
He is Dutch.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,779
That's right, so it doesn't have to do with Holland, you don't say a Hollander, or Netherlands, you don't say Netherlander, it's Dutch.

226
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:35,500
Dutch.

227
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,519
Dutch.

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,240
You'll also read this on like cookie tins, you know, boxes for cookies, Dutch-style cookies.

229
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:41,860
That's right.

230
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,980
All right, so that's a very important one when it comes to food.

231
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,139
But we're very curious to hear about where you come from.

232
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:55,700
You should try some of the new vocabulary words that we have introduced here, talk about your friends or your family, but also tell us if we didn't include your nationality.

233
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,440
That's right, all right, so we'll see you guys there.

234
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,460
EnglishPod.com.

235
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:58,879
Bye.

236
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,500
Bye.
