EnglishPod.com Hey, how was your first day of class?

2
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,640
I'm a level 2 and I'm loving my class this semester.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,300
It's great being in a class of international students.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,280
Mine was okay, except that no one in my class speaks English.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,679
I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class, so at least I should improve a lot this semester.

6
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,219
That's both fortunate and unfortunate.

7
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,300
It's the United Nations in my class.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,560
We have people from all over the world.

9
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:43,619
There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scott, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,020
Who else do we have?

11
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:50,299
Oh, we have a Moroccan, a Tagolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,479
That's quite the array of nationalities.

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,600
Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:08,400
There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,680
Well, I think you're pretty lucky, actually.

16
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:13,400
You'll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.

17
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,219
I guess so, but I think it's going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,519
I think I might change classes.

19
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,340
Don't!

20
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,120
Stay the course!

21
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,359
Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,599
I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.

23
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:31,739
I highly doubt it.

24
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,879
Your girlfriend is Chinese.

25
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:36,400
Well, there is that, yes.
