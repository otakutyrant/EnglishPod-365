EnglishPod.com Hello sir, what can I do for you today?

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, I need a new suit.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have an important interview next week so I really need to look sharp.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No problem we have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Great.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Very well, sir.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Sure.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Very good.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now if you will accompany me we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.
