EnglishPod.com Hello sir, what can I do for you today?

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,640
Hello, I need a new suit.

3
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,559
I have an important interview next week so I really need to look sharp.

4
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:22,760
No problem we have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:23,640
Great.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,359
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:29,719
Very well, sir.

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,679
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,359
Sure.

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,920
I also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,380
Very good.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,960
Now if you will accompany me we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.
