00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,580
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,339
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,359
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson all about going shopping.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,179
That's right.

5
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:15,240
Today we are going with a guy to a shop, and he's buying a new suit.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,539
Okay, so lots of great words for men or for buying clothes for your husband or brother.

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,420
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,640
Our next talk will be back in a moment.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,619
Hello, sir.

10
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:35,740
What can I do for you today?

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,380
Hello.

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,619
I need a new suit.

13
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,539
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

14
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:42,880
No problem.

15
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:46,740
We have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:47,619
Great.

17
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,359
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

18
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:53,719
Very well, sir.

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,700
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,359
Sure.

21
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,899
I'll also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,380
Very good.

23
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:05,980
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,939
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:18,859
So a very simple dialogue about a guy needing a suit, and he talked to the tailor apparently about a couple of things.

26
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,719
Now, why don't we take a look at some of those words in Language Takeaway?

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,760
Well, first of all, a tailor is a person who makes clothes.

28
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:33,680
So in this case, a man who makes suits.

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,180
And the first thing that we have to talk about is the kinds of suits that he has.

30
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,340
He says, we have a broad selection of suits.

31
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,859
Okay, so this adjective, broad, what does that mean?

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,040
It means wide.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,379
You know, you can have a very broad street.

34
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,680
That means many cars can fit across it.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,019
But in this case, we're talking about a selection.

36
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:58,379
So that means a broad selection of suits, very, very many suits to choose from.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:07,819
Okay, so for example, if you go to a music store, where they sell CDs and stuff like that, they might, they will have a broad selection of music.

38
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,520
So you can have rap and hip hop and R&B, etc.

39
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,319
That's right.

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,180
Or the iTunes store has a broad selection of music, you can choose basically anything.

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,979
That's right.

42
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,360
Okay.

43
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,039
So we have a broad selection of suits.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,599
And he said, well, great, I actually need a three piece suit.

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,580
Okay, so there are different kinds of suits.

46
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:36,000
Some just have two pieces like pants and a jacket, but the kind that the man wants is a three piece suit.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,060
So that means there's a jacket, pants, or trousers, some people might say, and the vest.

48
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:42,939
Okay.

49
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,280
So yeah, you've probably seen is that they look very nice.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,180
It's basically under or over your shirt, you wear a vest.

51
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,139
And so if you wear a vest with the suit, it's called the three piece suit.

52
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,740
You know who I'm thinking of right now who always wears three piece suits?

53
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,939
He's very famous, a football player, actually.

54
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

55
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,479
Really?

56
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,460
David Beckham.

57
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,379
I don't know if you guys watch the World Cup.

58
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,280
But in the World Cup, David Beckham was always wearing a three piece suit.

59
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:08,759
Wow.

60
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:09,520
And that heats.

61
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,180
That's amazing.

62
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,659
Okay, so we have a three piece suit.

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,780
Now we don't have a four piece suit, do we?

64
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:15,960
I don't think so.

65
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:22,020
Maybe tux, you have like the, on your waist, the cumberbund.

66
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:22,819
Oh, cumberbund.

67
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:23,419
That's what it's called.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:23,780
Okay.

69
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,520
Well, that's for a tuxedo.

70
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,400
Now, moving on, we talk about the materials of the suit.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,039
And he said, well, I preferably want something made from Italian cashmere or wool.

72
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,759
Okay, so Italian is an adjective that describes things that come from Italy.

73
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,180
And Italy is very famous for its fabrics and silk.

74
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,280
And so in this case, we're talking about Italian wool.

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,120
Cashmere is a very expensive, very soft kind of wool.

76
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, and wool is basically a sort of material that comes from the, from the sheep, from the hair of the sheep.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,680
That's right.

78
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,460
And so different sheep, different animals have different kinds of wool.

79
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,539
And these have different prices.

80
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,560
So some are more expensive and some are cheaper.

81
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,740
Cashmere is very expensive.

82
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,680
Okay, very good.

83
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,819
And so he also is offered some shirts and he's like, yeah, sure, I'll take some shirts.

84
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,420
And I also need some silver cuff links.

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:33,699
Okay, so when you close your shirts by your, by your wrist, you usually have a button or in some cases, something a little bit more fancy.

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,639
And when it's more fancy, it's called a cuff link.

87
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,839
Yes, you've probably seen it.

88
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:44,459
It looks like a small metal button that you can remove from your shirt.

89
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,040
So the, it looks a lot better.

90
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:55,379
It's kind of hard to explain, but just imagine on your wrist, you have a small metal button that you can close your shirt at the wrist.

91
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:55,980
That's right.

92
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,899
And some people have very, very fancy ones with special pictures.

93
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:07,439
So you could have, for example, a car if you love cars or a, you know, a diamond cuff link with a diamond on it.

94
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:07,939
That's right.

95
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:15,220
In this case, he wants a cuff links made of silver and also he wants a pair of silk ties.

96
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,620
So a pair of means two.

98
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:25,660
He wants two different silk ties and the tie is basically a, um, is something that you, you put around your neck.

99
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,259
Men wear these usually to the office and ones that are made of silk are usually more expensive.

100
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

101
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,699
So a silk tie and a, okay.

102
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,139
So we've pretty much covered everything that he needs.

103
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,000
He wants a very nice suit with a lot of great accessories.

104
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,180
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

105
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,779
And we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

106
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,740
Hello, sir.

107
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,839
What can I do for you today?

108
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,519
Hello.

109
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,819
I need a new suit.

110
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,680
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

111
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,019
No problem.

112
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:07,879
We have a broad selection of suits, all tailor made so it will fit perfectly.

113
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:08,740
Great.

114
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,480
I want a three piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

115
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:14,839
Very well, sir.

116
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,819
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

117
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:17,480
Sure.

118
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,000
I also take some silver cuff links and a pair of silk ties.

119
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:22,500
Very good.

120
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,120
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

121
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:39,500
So in Fluency Builder today, we have three very useful phrases that you can say when you're with the tailor at the store buying a suit.

122
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,819
The first one is to look sharp.

123
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:42,779
That's right.

124
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,800
He says that he has a job interview and he wants to look sharp.

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:47,680
Okay.

126
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,420
So to look means to have the appearance of, but sharp.

127
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,120
What does this mean?

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:02,779
Basically, take it as a chunk or as a phrase, and if you look sharp, it means you look smart, you look good, you look clean, you look very nice.

129
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,420
So this is normally something we say to men.

130
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,500
You look really sharp today.

131
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,839
Or I want him to look sharp.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to buy him a nice silk tie.

133
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,040
That's right.

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,439
So to look sharp, as I said, to look very nice, very clean, very handsome.

135
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,379
Okay.

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
So looking sharp.

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:30,639
And well, when we were talking about the suit, the person mentioned that all the suits are tailor-made.

138
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:31,480
All right.

139
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,759
This is a very important phrase if you want to go shopping for clothes that are made for you.

140
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,240
So something is tailor-made if the sizes are made only for fitting you.

141
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:42,779
That's right.

142
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,360
If you go to a department store and you buy a suit off of the shelf or the rack, it's not tailor-made.

143
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,319
But if the tailor makes it, he sews it to your size, then it's tailor-made.

144
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:54,899
That's right.

145
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,819
Wedding dresses are tailor-made.

146
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,720
Special suits are tailor-made.

147
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,660
So this is usually an expensive kind of clothing.

148
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,019
Okay.

149
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:06,300
So it basically means the tailor, the person, made it especially for you.

150
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,759
That's right.

151
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,579
And the opposite, as you said, would be off the rack.

152
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,620
Off the rack.

153
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,680
And this means that when you go to the store, you pick something, you like it, and you buy it.

154
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,540
There's no one that's going to sew it to make it fit you.

155
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,120
That's right.

156
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,079
So this is actually how most of us get our clothes.

157
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,680
You go to the department store, you get a pair of jeans, a t-shirt.

158
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,899
Obviously all that stuff is off the rack.

159
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,899
It's not tailor-made for your size.

160
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,480
That's right.

161
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,060
Okay.

162
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,000
But if you really want to get something tailor-made, you need to be able to talk to the tailor about it.

163
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:38,200
And so he will usually say, let me take your measurements.

164
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,460
This is our next phrase.

165
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,120
That's right.

166
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:45,200
The tailor mentioned that he wants to take them over there and take his measurements.

167
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,980
So when the tailor says, I want to take your measurements, or I need to take your measurements, what does that mean?

168
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,139
That means I need to measure parts of your body to help make the suit.

169
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,480
So he'll normally measure your shoulders, your waist, your hips, and how long things will be.

170
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:05,919
So your arms and your legs.

171
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:11,299
And these are all important measurements to know how big or how small to make the suit.

172
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:11,799
That's right.

173
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:17,279
You want the tailor to take your measurements, or you can also say you have to get measured.

174
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,220
That's right.

175
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,120
So to get measured or to take someone's measurements.

176
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,419
These are key phrases for buying a tailor-made suit.

177
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,159
Very good.

178
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,600
Okay.

179
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:29,700
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk some more.

180
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,460
Hello, sir.

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,539
What can I do for you today?

182
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,220
Hello.

183
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,480
I need a new suit.

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,379
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

185
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,720
No problem.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,559
We have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

187
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,460
Great.

188
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,179
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

189
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:58,559
Very well, sir.

190
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,519
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

191
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,179
Sure.

192
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
I'll also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

193
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,220
Very good.

194
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:10,840
Now if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,860
So do you have any tailor-made suits, Marco?

196
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,580
I actually don't.

197
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:23,940
I haven't – here to the office, I never wear a suit.

198
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:26,539
We don't really need to wear suits, all fancy.

199
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:34,460
And there have been very few occasions where I've needed a suit, so I actually don't have a suit at the moment.

200
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:35,379
Not even one.

201
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,159
Not even one.

202
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,600
Not even off the rack.

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,460
I left them all at home and I just haven't used them.

204
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,159
And probably they wouldn't fit anymore.

205
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,360
This is the problem with getting things tailor-made as well.

206
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,600
The thing is though, with a tailor-made suit, usually it's made to get bigger or smaller.

207
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:56,720
So maybe the shoulders and the arms are the same, but if you gain weight or you lose weight, the tailor can make those small, small changes.

208
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,440
That's right.

209
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:02,600
Actually I would – I had a friend who got some tailor-made jeans.

210
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,600
And I think that would be nice because sometimes, I don't know, jeans for me, they don't fit well.

211
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,500
Yeah, me neither.

212
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,899
There's a very famous company that does tailor-made jeans that I was thinking about going to because I hate buying jeans off the rack.

213
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,419
Yeah, they usually don't fit either.

214
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:23,259
The waist is too – I need a bigger waist, but then everything is too baggy and it just doesn't look right or everything is too small.

215
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,960
So I think this is a very interesting thing, although I don't know how expensive it would be because getting tailor-made clothes is relatively expensive.

216
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:34,580
It can be very expensive, although that's usually in America or in Europe.

217
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,200
In places like India and China, I think it's much more common to have things made to fit you, tailor-made.

218
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:49,220
This is a very interesting subject and actually we are wondering if maybe you know a tailor, you are a tailor, or you've gotten things tailor-made for you.

219
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,799
Maybe you got married recently and you had a tailor-made tuxedo or a tailor-made wedding dress.

220
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,240
That's right.

221
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,860
So let us know.

222
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,080
We can be found at EnglishPod.com.

223
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:57,980
We hope to see you there.

224
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,480
All right.

225
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:58,899
Bye, guys.

226
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,299
Bye.

227
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,720
Bye.
