00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson all about going shopping.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we are going with a guy to a shop, and he's buying a new suit.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so lots of great words for men or for buying clothes for your husband or brother.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Our next talk will be back in a moment.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello, sir.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What can I do for you today?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I need a new suit.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No problem.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Great.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Very well, sir.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sure.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Very good.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So a very simple dialogue about a guy needing a suit, and he talked to the tailor apparently about a couple of things.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now, why don't we take a look at some of those words in Language Takeaway?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, first of all, a tailor is a person who makes clothes.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So in this case, a man who makes suits.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And the first thing that we have to talk about is the kinds of suits that he has.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He says, we have a broad selection of suits.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, so this adjective, broad, what does that mean?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It means wide.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You know, you can have a very broad street.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That means many cars can fit across it.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But in this case, we're talking about a selection.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So that means a broad selection of suits, very, very many suits to choose from.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, so for example, if you go to a music store, where they sell CDs and stuff like that, they might, they will have a broad selection of music.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So you can have rap and hip hop and R&B, etc.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or the iTunes store has a broad selection of music, you can choose basically anything.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So we have a broad selection of suits.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And he said, well, great, I actually need a three piece suit.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so there are different kinds of suits.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Some just have two pieces like pants and a jacket, but the kind that the man wants is a three piece suit.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So that means there's a jacket, pants, or trousers, some people might say, and the vest.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So yeah, you've probably seen is that they look very nice.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's basically under or over your shirt, you wear a vest.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And so if you wear a vest with the suit, it's called the three piece suit.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You know who I'm thinking of right now who always wears three piece suits?

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
He's very famous, a football player, actually.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Really?

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
David Beckham.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know if you guys watch the World Cup.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But in the World Cup, David Beckham was always wearing a three piece suit.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wow.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And that heats.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's amazing.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, so we have a three piece suit.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now we don't have a four piece suit, do we?

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't think so.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Maybe tux, you have like the, on your waist, the cumberbund.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Oh, cumberbund.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's what it's called.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, that's for a tuxedo.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now, moving on, we talk about the materials of the suit.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And he said, well, I preferably want something made from Italian cashmere or wool.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, so Italian is an adjective that describes things that come from Italy.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And Italy is very famous for its fabrics and silk.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so in this case, we're talking about Italian wool.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Cashmere is a very expensive, very soft kind of wool.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, and wool is basically a sort of material that comes from the, from the sheep, from the hair of the sheep.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And so different sheep, different animals have different kinds of wool.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And these have different prices.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So some are more expensive and some are cheaper.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Cashmere is very expensive.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, very good.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And so he also is offered some shirts and he's like, yeah, sure, I'll take some shirts.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I also need some silver cuff links.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, so when you close your shirts by your, by your wrist, you usually have a button or in some cases, something a little bit more fancy.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And when it's more fancy, it's called a cuff link.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, you've probably seen it.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It looks like a small metal button that you can remove from your shirt.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So the, it looks a lot better.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's kind of hard to explain, but just imagine on your wrist, you have a small metal button that you can close your shirt at the wrist.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And some people have very, very fancy ones with special pictures.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So you could have, for example, a car if you love cars or a, you know, a diamond cuff link with a diamond on it.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In this case, he wants a cuff links made of silver and also he wants a pair of silk ties.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay.

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So a pair of means two.

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He wants two different silk ties and the tie is basically a, um, is something that you, you put around your neck.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Men wear these usually to the office and ones that are made of silk are usually more expensive.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So a silk tie and a, okay.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So we've pretty much covered everything that he needs.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He wants a very nice suit with a lot of great accessories.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hello, sir.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What can I do for you today?

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hello.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I need a new suit.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No problem.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We have a broad selection of suits, all tailor made so it will fit perfectly.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Great.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I want a three piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Very well, sir.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sure.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I also take some silver cuff links and a pair of silk ties.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Very good.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So in Fluency Builder today, we have three very useful phrases that you can say when you're with the tailor at the store buying a suit.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The first one is to look sharp.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He says that he has a job interview and he wants to look sharp.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So to look means to have the appearance of, but sharp.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What does this mean?

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Basically, take it as a chunk or as a phrase, and if you look sharp, it means you look smart, you look good, you look clean, you look very nice.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So this is normally something we say to men.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You look really sharp today.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Or I want him to look sharp.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to buy him a nice silk tie.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So to look sharp, as I said, to look very nice, very clean, very handsome.

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So looking sharp.

137
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And well, when we were talking about the suit, the person mentioned that all the suits are tailor-made.

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
All right.

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is a very important phrase if you want to go shopping for clothes that are made for you.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So something is tailor-made if the sizes are made only for fitting you.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's right.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you go to a department store and you buy a suit off of the shelf or the rack, it's not tailor-made.

143
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But if the tailor makes it, he sews it to your size, then it's tailor-made.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wedding dresses are tailor-made.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Special suits are tailor-made.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So this is usually an expensive kind of clothing.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So it basically means the tailor, the person, made it especially for you.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And the opposite, as you said, would be off the rack.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Off the rack.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And this means that when you go to the store, you pick something, you like it, and you buy it.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's no one that's going to sew it to make it fit you.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So this is actually how most of us get our clothes.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You go to the department store, you get a pair of jeans, a t-shirt.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Obviously all that stuff is off the rack.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's not tailor-made for your size.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's right.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But if you really want to get something tailor-made, you need to be able to talk to the tailor about it.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And so he will usually say, let me take your measurements.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is our next phrase.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's right.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The tailor mentioned that he wants to take them over there and take his measurements.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So when the tailor says, I want to take your measurements, or I need to take your measurements, what does that mean?

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That means I need to measure parts of your body to help make the suit.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So he'll normally measure your shoulders, your waist, your hips, and how long things will be.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So your arms and your legs.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And these are all important measurements to know how big or how small to make the suit.

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's right.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You want the tailor to take your measurements, or you can also say you have to get measured.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's right.

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So to get measured or to take someone's measurements.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
These are key phrases for buying a tailor-made suit.

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Very good.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk some more.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hello, sir.

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What can I do for you today?

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I need a new suit.

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No problem.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We have a broad selection of suits all tailor-made so it will fit perfectly.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Great.

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I want a three-piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Very well, sir.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Would you like to have some shirts made also?

191
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sure.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll also take some silver cufflinks and a pair of silk ties.

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Very good.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So do you have any tailor-made suits, Marco?

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I actually don't.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I haven't – here to the office, I never wear a suit.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We don't really need to wear suits, all fancy.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And there have been very few occasions where I've needed a suit, so I actually don't have a suit at the moment.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Not even one.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Not even one.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Not even off the rack.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I left them all at home and I just haven't used them.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And probably they wouldn't fit anymore.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is the problem with getting things tailor-made as well.

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The thing is though, with a tailor-made suit, usually it's made to get bigger or smaller.

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So maybe the shoulders and the arms are the same, but if you gain weight or you lose weight, the tailor can make those small, small changes.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right.

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Actually I would – I had a friend who got some tailor-made jeans.

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And I think that would be nice because sometimes, I don't know, jeans for me, they don't fit well.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, me neither.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There's a very famous company that does tailor-made jeans that I was thinking about going to because I hate buying jeans off the rack.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, they usually don't fit either.

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The waist is too – I need a bigger waist, but then everything is too baggy and it just doesn't look right or everything is too small.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I think this is a very interesting thing, although I don't know how expensive it would be because getting tailor-made clothes is relatively expensive.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It can be very expensive, although that's usually in America or in Europe.

217
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
In places like India and China, I think it's much more common to have things made to fit you, tailor-made.

218
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is a very interesting subject and actually we are wondering if maybe you know a tailor, you are a tailor, or you've gotten things tailor-made for you.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe you got married recently and you had a tailor-made tuxedo or a tailor-made wedding dress.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's right.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So let us know.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We can be found at EnglishPod.com.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We hope to see you there.

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All right.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Bye, guys.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Bye.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Bye.
