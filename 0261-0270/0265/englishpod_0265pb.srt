00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we are dealing with a house that is filled with different types of bugs.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ew, bugs.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, it's summertime, so it's not that uncommon, but not a pleasant thing to deal with.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we're going to call an exterminator.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So you might be asking yourself what that is, but before we explain, why don't you listen to the dialogue for the first time.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
These bugs are driving us crazy.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We just bought this house, and it is infected with just about everything.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, there's nothing that we can't handle.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Unfortunately, that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No problem.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Just get rid of the bugs.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So now we have six keywords that we've chosen out for you.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's take a look at those now on Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, Marco, you've already told our users the very first word.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That would be exterminator.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What is an exterminator?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a person, right?

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a person that has the job to exterminate or to delete or eliminate different types of bugs or pests.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So an exterminator's job is to kill bugs.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And usually an exterminator comes to your home or your office to do this, right?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So maybe in your house you have a lot of different types of bugs.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Maybe you have, I don't know, spiders.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So an exterminator will come and he will try to get rid of the spiders.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Great.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So an exterminator, in a general sense, gets rid of pests, and pest is our next word.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A pest.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now, we're talking about bugs, and they can be considered a sort of pest.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, pest, though, is a more general term, right?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So you can say pest about something like rats or mice.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So basically some type of animal that is very annoying and also causes some sort of harm or danger.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So there was a movie, if I remember correctly, in the 1990s.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It was terrible, and it was called The Pest.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, that's right.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And it's all about this person who is very annoying.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So you can even say an annoying person or a bothersome person is a pest.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're such a pest.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Okay.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So obviously our home is filled with bugs, and that's what the person said, that it is infested.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So a place, like an office building, or like you said, Marco, a home is infested if it is filled with something.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And so infested means it's filled with something bad.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So in this case, the house is infested with bugs.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They're living upstairs, downstairs, in the basement, in the kitchen, they're everywhere.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And she said that we, well, actually they have termites in the wood.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All right.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So termites are a special kind of bug that almost always live in wood, right?

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They're little bugs that I think eat the wood.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And this is why they're so dangerous, because they make the house weak, because they eat off all the wood that supports it.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So we can say the house fell down because it was infested with termites.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Termites.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And also we have a very common pest or a bug.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We have cockroaches.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, I hate these.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And they're everywhere this summer.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Cockroaches come in different sizes.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Some are big, some are small, but they're very, very strong bugs.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They can live through anything.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They're small, usually brown, but sometimes I think you can see black cockroaches.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And they love to be near food and decaying things like garbage bins.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's right.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So a very common type of pest, cockroach.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And in order to get rid of termites and cockroaches and all these types of bugs, we have to fumigate the house.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So this is one method that the exterminator uses to kill bugs.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And like in the dialogue, when you fumigate a house, basically you fill the house with fumes or gases that kill bugs.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So people like you and me, we can't be in the house when that happens, right?

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Actually, if you see an exterminator, he will always fumigate wearing a mask so he doesn't inhale those poisonous gas.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Right.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So it's very dangerous for people and you'll have to make sure you talk to your exterminator to make sure that the gases he's using aren't getting into your body.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's right.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
These bugs are driving us crazy.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well there's nothing that we can't handle.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Unfortunately, that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No problem.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Just get rid of the bugs.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All right, so now we've chosen three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

114
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well this first phrase comes from the very beginning of today's dialogue.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The second person in the dialogue says these bugs are driving us crazy, so to drive someone crazy.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, so if you're driving someone crazy, it means that you're making them crazy.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
All right, so it could be you're making them angry or you're making them frustrated, but it has nothing to do with cars, right?

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, there's no driving involved.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So driving here means making.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're making me crazy.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You're really making me frustrated.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's right.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So in this case, the animals, the bugs were driving them crazy.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They were so annoying that they were very irritated.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So I could do something, Marco, that will drive you crazy.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I could tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's right.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's driving me crazy.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Doesn't annoy you?

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, yes.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, so I'll stop so it doesn't drive you crazy anymore.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's right.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, so now obviously bugs are driving them crazy, and she went on to explain that it's because the house is infested with just about everything.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Well this is a great phrase because we can say it in a lot of different contexts.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
In this context, it means there is not everything, every single bug in the house, but just about everything.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That means almost every bug you can think of is in this house.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So it's kind of a way of exaggerating also because obviously, well, they have cockroaches, they have termites, but they're saying we have a lot of different types of bugs.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We have just about everything that you can imagine.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You could even say, this restaurant has just about every Chinese dish you could ever think of.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's not true, it doesn't have every single one, but it has a lot.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, so that's the way that you use just about everything.

144
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And for our final phrase, we used it a little bit earlier on, let's explain it a little bit.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When we're talking about bugs, we want to get rid of bugs.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is why we call the exterminator, to get rid of the cockroaches.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You might hear this phrase a lot when you're watching movies about gangsters or mobsters, like The Sopranos, the TV show, get rid of him, right?

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this is a phrase that means, in this case, to kill something or to kill someone, to get rid of it, to get rid of him.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
To not have it anymore.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So, rid means to get away or to throw away.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But in this case, you're not just throwing it away, you're killing these bugs.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's right.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So we want to get rid of the bugs.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now obviously, as you said, we can also throw away, for example, these shoes are too old.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm going to get rid of them.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or, hey Marco, this milk smells funny.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you get rid of it?

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mm-hmm.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Very good.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So that's the way that you would use that phrase, to get rid of something.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the very last time, and we're back to talk a little bit more.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
These bugs are driving us crazy.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We just bought this house, and it is infected with just about everything.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard.

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, there's nothing that we can't handle.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

171
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Unfortunately, that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
No problem.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Just get rid of the bugs.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So bugs.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Everyone loves bugs, right?

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know.

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm actually okay with termites or, for example, cockroaches.

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
They're a little bit weird, but I actually really dislike spiders.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So you're okay with cockroaches, but spiders make you nervous.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Spiders are...

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, the thing is, spiders can actually hurt you.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And cockroaches generally cannot.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They're gross.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They're dirty.

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But spiders, there are very, very many kinds of dangerous spiders out there that are poisonous.

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's right.

189
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So for example, termites, nothing's going to happen, or cockroaches, they're nasty.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Not unless your house is weakened by hundreds of millions of termites.

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's right.

192
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But for example, I think other people have snakes sometimes as pests, because they live in areas that have a lot of snakes, or mice, because snakes are attracted by mice.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So some people keep cats for that reason.

195
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They want the cats, especially on farms, the cats to catch the mice, or to scare the snakes away.

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But I don't really have a problem with snakes or spiders, but I do have a problem with scorpions.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, scorpions.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you live close to a desert or a very dry area, scorpions, they really scare me.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I've seen on, I think, Discovery Channel that in Australia they're very common, and so not only scorpions, but also spiders.

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So whenever you put your shoes on, you have to check that there's nothing in it.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Also, shower drains.

203
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You know where the water goes down the hole in the shower?

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oftentimes you get things like scorpions in the desert areas that come out of the drains.

205
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Really?

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, wow.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That looks like something from a horror movie or something.

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah, and all of a sudden you're in the shower and there's pests coming out of the drains.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, that's nasty.

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Terrifying.

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
All right, so a lot of different types of kind of scary bugs and pests, but we would like to know if you've ever had an infestation in your home, or what pests are you afraid of?

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So let us know.

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We hope to see you there.

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
All right.

We'll see you guys next time.

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Bye.
