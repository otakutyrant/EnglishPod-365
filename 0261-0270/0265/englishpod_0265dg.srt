EnglishPod.com Hi, did you call for an exterminator?

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,500
Yes, thank goodness you're here.

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,899
These bugs are driving us crazy.

4
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,219
What sort of pests are we dealing with?

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,960
We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,760
We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,740
Well there's nothing that we can handle.

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,899
I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of.

9
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,880
We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,759
Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.

11
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:49,520
No problem, just get rid of the bugs.
