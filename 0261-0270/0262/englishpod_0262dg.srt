EnglishPod.com Well, Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:10,160
I don't think so, Mr Parsons.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,839
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,599
Okay, well, listen.

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,059
Here's my business card with my mobile number.

6
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:20,820
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,699
Of course, you can also call Miss Childs, too.

00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,339
Great.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,640
Um, when can I expect to hear from you?

10
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:34,820
Well, we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week.

11
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:38,460
Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,320
How does that sound?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,939
That sounds perfect.
