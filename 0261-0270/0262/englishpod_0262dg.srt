EnglishPod.com Well, Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't think so, Mr Parsons.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, well, listen.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here's my business card with my mobile number.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Of course, you can also call Miss Childs, too.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Great.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Um, when can I expect to hear from you?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How does that sound?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That sounds perfect.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, Mr Parsons.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The pleasure's all mine, Rebecca.

Absolutely.
