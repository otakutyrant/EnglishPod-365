00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And if you've been following along with us recently, you'll know that we have a series about interviewing in English, and so today we have the very last episode of that series.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today is the last part of our interview series, and we're basically just saying goodbye and we're doing some other things when you're leaving an interview.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's very important, the things that you say.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right, because this is the last thing that you're going to do in the interview, so it's what your interviewer will remember.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't think so, Mr.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Parsons.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, well, listen, here's my business card with my mobile number.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Of course, you can also call Ms.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Childs, too.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Great.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Um, when can I expect to hear from you?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, we are finishing the short list interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ms.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How does that sound?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That sounds perfect.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, Mr.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Parsons.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The pleasure's all mine, Rebecca.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I hope to hear from you very soon.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Absolutely.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thanks for coming, Rebecca.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Goodbye.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, great.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So really good things from Rebecca.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She said some very interesting things, key things there.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So why don't we take a look at those on Language Takeaway?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
At the beginning of the end of the interview, Rebecca says, listen, I think you have covered all the main points for me.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So this is after Mr.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Parsons asks her if she has questions.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And this word, covered, is very important.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So if we talk about cover, to cover the main points, or to cover a topic, it means to discuss it thoroughly or to have it finished.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if I still have questions, we have not covered everything.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But if I did ask all the questions that I have, then we've covered everything.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So the verb here is to cover.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And Mr.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Parsons says, well, you know what, here's my business card with my mobile number.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So this word, business card, key element of any interview or any business situation.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As you say, a key part of any business interaction.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So a business card is a very small card, usually thick.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And it has a person's name, job, phone number, and sometimes email address now on the card.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So the information can change.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But it's a contact card, basically, for one person.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So this is very important to have around, especially in situations like this.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And moving on, he also told her that if she has any other questions, to not hesitate and to contact him.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is a very common phrase.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't hesitate to contact me or don't hesitate to ask.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So to hesitate means to be nervous about something or to maybe not do it because you're uncomfortable.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, you know, Marco, I want to ask you something, but I'm not sure if I want to ask you.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Maybe you'll be angry.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I'm hesitating.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The verb here is to hesitate.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have doubts.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I have doubts.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And so he says, don't hesitate to contact me.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That means any questions, any issues, please call me.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Very good.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And Mr.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Parsons said that they are finishing the short list of interviews tomorrow.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So what does it mean, a short list?

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, a short list is something we talk about during the interview process because the interviewer, so in this case, Mr.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Parsons, will have a long list of people who want the job.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And maybe after the first interview, he will cut the list down to a very small number of people, 10 or 15.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And that is called the short list.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So those are the people who did well on the first interview, but who maybe should come back for a second or third interview.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Very good.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So a lot of great things there.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why don't we take a break?

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's go back and listen to the dialogue.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's see what Mr.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Parsons and Rebecca said.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And we'll be back with some really good phrases that you can close off an interview with.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't think so, Mr.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Parsons.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Well, listen, here's my business card with my mobile number.

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Of course, you can also call Ms.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Childs too.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Great.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Um, when can I expect to hear from you?

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, we are finishing the short list interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Ms.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How does that sound?

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That sounds perfect.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, Mr.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Parsons.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I hope to hear from you very soon.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Absolutely.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thanks for coming, Rebecca.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Goodbye.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
All right, we're back.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So now let's take a look at those phrases we mentioned on Fluency Builder.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Fluency Builder.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So let's go back to the beginning where Mr.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Parsons is talking about, uh, questions that Rebecca might have.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And so Mr.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Parsons says if any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So this phrase spring to mind is very interesting.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What does this mean?

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, basically if something springs to your mind or springs to mind, it means that it comes very suddenly and quickly into your mind.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It just pops into your head.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wow.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So to spring or springs in this case is like jumping.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So something hits your mind very quickly.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It comes into your mind very quickly.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, oh, I don't really have any ideas, Marco, for that party next week, but you know, if anything springs to mind, you should let me know.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So if you have any sudden ideas or anything you suddenly remember, that's what it means to spring to mind.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So taking a look at these expressions that Rebecca used when she's leaving, for example, you know that you finished the interview and a typical question that you want to make is when can I expect to hear from you?

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is a great question at the end of an interview because it's basically a way of saying, listen, I'm interested in this job.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
When will you call me about it?

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And so the phrase, when can I expect to hear from you means when will you tell me your decision?

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's right.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But it's a lot more polite and formal and better than saying, when are you going to call me?

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You would never say that.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, you wouldn't want to say that in an interview because it makes you sound desperate, like you really need the job.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
In this case, you know, when can I expect to hear from you?

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's like, oh, well, you know, I hope that you'll get in touch with me.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And well, he explained that they're short-listing everything and that they will be in touch with her very soon.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And she said, wow, that sounds perfect.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me.

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So this phrase, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me is very long, but you know what thank you very much means.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The key here is for taking the time to do something.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now what does this mean?

152
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What is another way we can use this?

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's basically saying thank you so much for giving me an opportunity to talk to you.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I know you're very busy and I know you don't have a lot of time, so thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right.

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So you could even use this with a teacher at school.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You know, you have a question, your teacher is busy, but your teacher makes some time to meet with you.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You say, hey, listen, professor or listen, teacher, thank you so much for taking the time to speak to me.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're just demonstrating that you appreciate the effort and the time.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And you're being very polite.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And now the last phrase, when Rebecca is leaving the room, they're shaking hands maybe and Rebecca says, I hope to hear from you very soon.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can say I hope to hear from you soon, but in this case she's saying, listen, I really want this job.

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
She doesn't want to say call me, you know, call me tomorrow.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
She says, I hope to hear from you soon.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And I hope that this works out, that I get the job.

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So she's basically demonstrating a lot of interest saying, well, I really like the job and I really would like for you to call me and give me good news.

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So I hope to hear from you soon.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Exactly.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and we'll be back in a moment to talk a little bit more about how to end an interview.

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Well, Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't think so, Mr Parsons.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I think you have covered all the main points for me.

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay.

177
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, listen, here's my business card with my mobile number.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If any other questions spring to mind, don't hesitate to contact me.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Of course, you can also call Ms.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Childs too.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Great.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Um, when can I expect to hear from you?

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well, we are finishing the short list interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ms.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday.

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How does that sound?

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That sounds perfect.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me, Mr Parsons.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The pleasure is all mine, Rebecca.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I hope to hear from you very soon.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Absolutely.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Thanks for coming, Rebecca.

193
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Goodbye.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So this is a great way of ending an interview.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Rebecca did a really good job.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And I think there are a couple of suggestions or tips that you would like to give our users.

197
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, well, one of them is don't at the end of the interview, ask the person if you have the job.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They'll say we will be in touch or thank you so much for coming in.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But if they don't say we would really like to have you join this company, then you probably shouldn't ask.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You should say, you know, I when can I expect to hear from you?

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's more polite.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because I think a lot of times if you didn't get the job, it makes the interviewer feel very uncomfortable.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But also it's just a polite thing to do.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So be careful with that.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And I've also been told from people in business that if you do receive a job offer, don't accept right away.

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Say I will think about it and I'll get back in touch with you.

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Kind of like a strategy maybe to better negotiate the terms and conditions.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So you want to take that information, you want to go home, you want to think about it, talk about it with your wife or your husband and decide, is this something I want?

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And then you can contact the employer.

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Right.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, I think that's a very good idea.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And also, I think it's not a wise thing to call or contact the employer asking if you've got the job or asking if they have any news yet, because I think that can be a little bit annoying.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But if they say we will be in touch on Tuesday and it's a week later and they never got back to you, send a follow up.

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Of course.

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A follow up is an email or a letter or even a phone call where you say, listen, I'm really glad I got to meet you today.

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I hope that we have the opportunity to work together in the future.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Please be in touch.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Sincerely.

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then your name.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Kind of like a reminder.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a reminder.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like I want the job.

223
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Here's my information.

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's let's do this.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Or at least if I didn't get the job, let me know that I didn't get it.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, exactly.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
All right.

228
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So a lot of great advice here.

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Great things coming.

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And we'll be back again with another series.

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're going to have a presentation series, so be sure to keep an eye out for that.

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And if you have any other questions or comments, we're always at EnglishPod.com where you can find us.

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We'll see you there.

234
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Bye, guys.
