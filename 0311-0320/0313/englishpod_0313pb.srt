00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,879
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,580
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:12,560
My name is Katherine, and as you know, we've had a series going about small talk in English, so today's lesson is a part of that series.

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,099
That's right.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:22,940
Today we're going to listen to two friends, two girlfriends, meeting, and they haven't seen each other for a long time, so we're just going to see how they quickly have a small conversation.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,460
Hey, Michelle.

7
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,440
Is that you?

8
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,100
Wow.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,879
Grace.

10
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:33,320
Long time no see.

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:34,799
Where have you been?

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,679
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,579
Well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,460
You did?

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,579
Congratulations.

16
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:43,820
Thanks a lot.

17
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:45,880
So how are things with you, Michelle?

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,320
Well, same old, same old, you know.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,960
Nothing much has changed here.

20
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,280
Are you still seeing Chris?

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,200
No.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,219
Actually, we split up last month.

23
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,140
Oh, dear.

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,859
I'm sorry to hear that.

25
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:03,420
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party, so, well, let's just wait and see.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,560
Good for you, Michelle.

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,659
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,000
Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,120
So the first word we have here today, Marco, is the word promotion.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,859
Grace says, well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office.

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,859
That's right.

32
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,140
So she got a promotion, and a promotion is work-related.

33
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:34,599
That means that you got a better position.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,319
That's right.

35
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,099
But you didn't change companies.

36
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:45,540
So in your company, you had a job, and you did well in that job, and so your boss gave you a better job in the company, and that's a promotion.

37
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,439
That's right.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,799
Okay, so she got a promotion.

39
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:59,239
When they were talking about work, and now they started talking about their personal life, and Grace asked if Michelle is still seeing Chris.

40
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,939
Okay, so the verb here is to see someone, to be seeing someone.

41
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,120
We're not actually talking about eyes and looking, we're talking about dating.

42
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:08,780
That's right.

43
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,259
So if you're seeing Chris, it means you are dating Chris.

44
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,520
Okay, so that's an interesting way of describing a relationship.

45
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,599
So you say, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm seeing someone.

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,060
I can't date you, I'm seeing someone else.

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,139
Or you could ask someone, are you seeing anyone right now?

48
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:27,979
That means are you dating anyone?

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,280
Do you have a boyfriend, basically?

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,379
Okay.

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,699
And sadly, no, they are not together anymore.

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,020
She says, actually, we split up last month.

53
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,280
All right, so this is another relationship term.

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,419
To split up means to break up, or to stop dating.

55
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,240
To stop seeing each other.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,580
So there are two ways of seeing it, as you said, to split up or to break up.

57
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,139
That's right.

58
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:56,680
So unfortunately they split up, or unfortunately they broke up, they are no longer seeing each other.

59
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,639
That's right.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,159
Okay.

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,039
But she said she had some good news because she met a really cute guy at a networking party.

62
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,300
What is networking?

63
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,900
All right, so networking is something that you do, especially in the business world.

64
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,580
You go to events, parties, happy hours, and you meet people.

65
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,080
You meet strangers, and you talk about work, and you try to meet as many people as you can.

66
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:26,300
Okay, so it's not really a social party to actually just go and meet random people.

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,099
You're trying to meet people that will be interesting for your business, or maybe to get some other ideas.

68
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,259
It's for a business purpose.

69
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:33,939
That's right.

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:44,500
So perhaps in your town, you own a small business, and your town has decided to have a Chamber of Commerce networking party, so you can meet other small business owners.

71
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,759
Okay, very good.

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,400
So that's what we have for Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,180
Let's go back and listen to our dialogue for the second time.

74
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,599
Hey Michelle, is that you?

75
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,439
Wow, Grace, long time no see.

76
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,979
Where have you been?

77
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,740
Oh yeah, well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

78
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,539
You did?

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,460
Congratulations!

80
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:11,960
Thanks a lot.

81
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,000
So, how are things with you, Michelle?

82
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,480
Well, same old, same old, you know.

83
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,100
Nothing much has changed here.

84
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,379
Are you still seeing Chris?

85
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,300
No, actually, we split up last month.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,939
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,540
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party, so, well, let's just wait and see.

88
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:32,759
Good for you, Michelle!

89
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,259
All right, so now let's talk about these small, quick, but very useful phrases for small talk on Fluency Builder.

90
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:47,379
Fluency Builder.

91
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:56,279
So this first phrase is a phrase that you'll hear a lot when people greet each other, but perhaps friends who haven't seen each other in a very long time.

92
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,100
We use this phrase, long time no see.

93
00:04:59,399 --> 00:04:59,839
That's right.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,819
Now, you look at it and it may seem like it's incorrect, right, because you're missing something.

95
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:06,759
That's right.

96
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,019
Long time no see.

97
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:08,980
Who knows see?

98
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,319
What long time?

99
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,040
That's right.

100
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,360
But this actually means, I haven't seen you in a long time.

101
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,259
That's right.

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,800
So the phrase is, long time no see, hey, Michelle, long time no see, how are you?

103
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,199
That's the way that you use it, but just take it as a phrase, don't try to analyze it too much.

104
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,100
So, hey Marco, long time no see.

105
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,160
That's right.

106
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:29,639
Okay.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
And, well, they're talking and she's like, well, how are you?

108
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:35,899
And she says, well, you know, same old, same old.

109
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,500
All right, this is another one.

110
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,680
It doesn't look right.

111
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,680
It looks wrong.

112
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,160
But we do say this, and twice, same old, same old.

113
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,759
And this means nothing has changed.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,459
There's nothing really new in my life.

115
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:48,839
Right.

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,680
The same old things in my life, nothing really new or exciting.

117
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,319
Same old.

118
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:53,699
Exactly.

119
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:56,500
So I could say, hey, Marco, you know, how's the job going?

120
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,199
You know, same old, same old.

121
00:05:58,699 --> 00:05:59,000
All right.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,740
So nothing has changed in his job.

123
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,279
He has not gotten a promotion.

124
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,899
That's right.

125
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:02,939
All right.

126
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,579
So now Michelle was, again, describing about the guy that she met at the networking party.

127
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,220
And she said, well, let's just wait and see.

128
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,800
It seems like an incomplete sentence because let's wait and see what.

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,839
All right.

130
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,019
So let's wait and see what.

131
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
That's the question, though.

132
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,540
You know, what are we waiting to see?

133
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:30,600
Well, she's basically saying, we don't know how things will go, but we, you know, we'll have to wait for the future to come before we can make a decision or figure out what's going on.

134
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,160
That's right.

135
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,399
So, for example, Marco, we're at the office and I say, how is that report coming along?

136
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,379
Is it, you know, were the numbers good?

137
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,540
And I can say, yeah, the numbers seemed all right, but we'll just wait and see.

138
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,199
Perhaps we don't have all the numbers yet, so we have to wait to get the rest of them.

139
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,699
That's right.

140
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,000
So you're just basically saying, I don't know what will happen in the future.

141
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,519
Let's just hope that it will be good and let's see what happens.

142
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:57,019
Let's just wait and see.

143
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,339
Let's just wait and see.

144
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,000
All right.

145
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,100
So let's go back and listen to our dialogue one last time.

146
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:50,939
Okay, so this was another part of our small talk series.

147
00:07:51,060 --> 00:08:01,759
As you see, very useful and quick little phrases so you can have a very brief conversation with maybe someone you haven't seen or a little chit chat at the office.

148
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,379
That's right.

149
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,360
And these are things that if you remember them, you memorize them, you can use in almost any conversation.

150
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,980
Also, I'm sorry to hear that or good for you.

151
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:15,240
These are really great phrases that are very, very flexible.

152
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,079
That's right.

153
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,660
Actually, that's a really good one.

154
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:24,500
I'm sorry to hear that maybe someone gives you a little bit of bad news or something bad happened in their life.

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,759
But it's very polite and a nice way of saying, hey, I understand.

156
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm sorry to hear that.

157
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:30,920
That's right.

158
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,440
So we hope that you've learned something new in today's lesson.

159
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:41,899
If you have any questions about the phrases or words you've heard, please check out our website EnglishPod.com and leave us a question on the community section or in a note.

160
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,100
We'll be happy to answer them.

161
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,720
All right, guys.

162
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,240
We'll see you there.

163
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,679
Bye.

164
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,000
Bye.
