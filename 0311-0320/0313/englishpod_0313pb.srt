00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine, and as you know, we've had a series going about small talk in English, so today's lesson is a part of that series.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we're going to listen to two friends, two girlfriends, meeting, and they haven't seen each other for a long time, so we're just going to see how they quickly have a small conversation.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey, Michelle.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Is that you?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Wow.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Grace.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Long time no see.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Where have you been?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, yeah.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You did?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Congratulations.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thanks a lot.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So how are things with you, Michelle?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, same old, same old, you know.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Nothing much has changed here.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you still seeing Chris?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Actually, we split up last month.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, dear.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party, so, well, let's just wait and see.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good for you, Michelle.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of the language on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So the first word we have here today, Marco, is the word promotion.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Grace says, well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's right.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So she got a promotion, and a promotion is work-related.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That means that you got a better position.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But you didn't change companies.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So in your company, you had a job, and you did well in that job, and so your boss gave you a better job in the company, and that's a promotion.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, so she got a promotion.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000
When they were talking about work, and now they started talking about their personal life, and Grace asked if Michelle is still seeing Chris.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, so the verb here is to see someone, to be seeing someone.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We're not actually talking about eyes and looking, we're talking about dating.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if you're seeing Chris, it means you are dating Chris.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, so that's an interesting way of describing a relationship.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So you say, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm seeing someone.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't date you, I'm seeing someone else.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or you could ask someone, are you seeing anyone right now?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That means are you dating anyone?

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you have a boyfriend, basically?

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And sadly, no, they are not together anymore.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She says, actually, we split up last month.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, so this is another relationship term.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
To split up means to break up, or to stop dating.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To stop seeing each other.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So there are two ways of seeing it, as you said, to split up or to break up.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So unfortunately they split up, or unfortunately they broke up, they are no longer seeing each other.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But she said she had some good news because she met a really cute guy at a networking party.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What is networking?

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
All right, so networking is something that you do, especially in the business world.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You go to events, parties, happy hours, and you meet people.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You meet strangers, and you talk about work, and you try to meet as many people as you can.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, so it's not really a social party to actually just go and meet random people.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're trying to meet people that will be interesting for your business, or maybe to get some other ideas.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's for a business purpose.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So perhaps in your town, you own a small business, and your town has decided to have a Chamber of Commerce networking party, so you can meet other small business owners.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, very good.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So that's what we have for Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's go back and listen to our dialogue for the second time.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey Michelle, is that you?

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wow, Grace, long time no see.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Where have you been?

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh yeah, well, you see, I got a promotion, so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You did?

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Congratulations!

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Thanks a lot.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So, how are things with you, Michelle?

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Well, same old, same old, you know.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Nothing much has changed here.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are you still seeing Chris?

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No, actually, we split up last month.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party, so, well, let's just wait and see.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Good for you, Michelle!

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right, so now let's talk about these small, quick, but very useful phrases for small talk on Fluency Builder.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Fluency Builder.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So this first phrase is a phrase that you'll hear a lot when people greet each other, but perhaps friends who haven't seen each other in a very long time.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We use this phrase, long time no see.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now, you look at it and it may seem like it's incorrect, right, because you're missing something.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Long time no see.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who knows see?

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What long time?

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's right.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But this actually means, I haven't seen you in a long time.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So the phrase is, long time no see, hey, Michelle, long time no see, how are you?

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's the way that you use it, but just take it as a phrase, don't try to analyze it too much.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, hey Marco, long time no see.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's right.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And, well, they're talking and she's like, well, how are you?

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And she says, well, you know, same old, same old.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right, this is another one.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It doesn't look right.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It looks wrong.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But we do say this, and twice, same old, same old.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And this means nothing has changed.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's nothing really new in my life.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The same old things in my life, nothing really new or exciting.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Same old.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Exactly.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So I could say, hey, Marco, you know, how's the job going?

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You know, same old, same old.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
All right.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So nothing has changed in his job.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He has not gotten a promotion.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's right.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All right.

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So now Michelle was, again, describing about the guy that she met at the networking party.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And she said, well, let's just wait and see.

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It seems like an incomplete sentence because let's wait and see what.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

130
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So let's wait and see what.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's the question, though.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You know, what are we waiting to see?

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, she's basically saying, we don't know how things will go, but we, you know, we'll have to wait for the future to come before we can make a decision or figure out what's going on.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's right.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So, for example, Marco, we're at the office and I say, how is that report coming along?

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it, you know, were the numbers good?

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And I can say, yeah, the numbers seemed all right, but we'll just wait and see.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Perhaps we don't have all the numbers yet, so we have to wait to get the rest of them.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's right.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So you're just basically saying, I don't know what will happen in the future.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's just hope that it will be good and let's see what happens.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's just wait and see.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's just wait and see.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All right.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So let's go back and listen to our dialogue one last time.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, so this was another part of our small talk series.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,000
As you see, very useful and quick little phrases so you can have a very brief conversation with maybe someone you haven't seen or a little chit chat at the office.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's right.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And these are things that if you remember them, you memorize them, you can use in almost any conversation.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Also, I'm sorry to hear that or good for you.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
These are really great phrases that are very, very flexible.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's right.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Actually, that's a really good one.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry to hear that maybe someone gives you a little bit of bad news or something bad happened in their life.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But it's very polite and a nice way of saying, hey, I understand.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's right.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So we hope that you've learned something new in today's lesson.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you have any questions about the phrases or words you've heard, please check out our website EnglishPod.com and leave us a question on the community section or in a note.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We'll be happy to answer them.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
All right, guys.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We'll see you there.

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Bye.

164
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Bye.
