EnglishPod.com Hey Michelle, is that you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wow, Grace!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Long time no see!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Where have you been?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh yeah, well you see I got a promotion so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You did?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Congratulations!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So, how are things with you, Michelle?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, same old, same old, you know.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Nothing much has changed here.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Are you still seeing Chris?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, actually we split up last month.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, well, let's just wait and see.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Good for you, Michelle!
