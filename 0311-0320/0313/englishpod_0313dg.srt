EnglishPod.com Hey Michelle, is that you?

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,779
Wow, Grace!

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,160
Long time no see!

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,679
Where have you been?

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:18,480
Oh yeah, well you see I got a promotion so I moved to the new Pudong office last September.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,359
You did?

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,460
Congratulations!

8
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:21,699
Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,760
So, how are things with you, Michelle?

10
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,260
Well, same old, same old, you know.

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,879
Nothing much has changed here.

12
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,120
Are you still seeing Chris?

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,079
No, actually we split up last month.

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,679
Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,759
But I met a really cute guy last night at a networking party.

16
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,299
So, well, let's just wait and see.

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,460
Good for you, Michelle!
