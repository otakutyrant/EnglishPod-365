00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Melanie, can you help me with something?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sure Tracy, let me just get my laptop.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right, all set.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, so, to whom it may concern, I am writing… Umm, Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them, so in English, you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay, more relaxed.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Got it.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey Sally, what's up?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is Tracy here?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just… Okay Tracy, now it's too relaxed.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You've still got to show some respect.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How about starting with Dear Miss Cooper?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm writing to confirm… Great, okay.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Viola magazine.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's great.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to $45,600 RMB.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thanks for… Whoa, okay, back up a second Tracy.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's too direct.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before publication?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You don't want to offend her.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oops, okay, you're right.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then I can just end with all the best, Tracy.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with yours sincerely.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's more professional.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you.
