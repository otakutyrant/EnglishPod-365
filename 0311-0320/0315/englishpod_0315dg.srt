EnglishPod.com Melanie, can you help me with something?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,719
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,239
Sure Tracy, let me just get my laptop.

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,300
Right, all set.

5
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:38,539
Okay, so, to whom it may concern, I am writing… Umm, Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

6
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:46,020
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them, so in English, you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

7
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,520
Okay, more relaxed.

8
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,560
Got it.

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,500
Hey Sally, what's up?

10
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:51,600
Is Tracy here?

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,939
Just… Okay Tracy, now it's too relaxed.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,200
You've still got to show some respect.

13
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:00,479
How about starting with Dear Miss Cooper?

14
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:03,560
I'm writing to confirm… Great, okay.

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:20,400
Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Viola magazine.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,200
That's great.

17
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:33,019
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to $45,600 RMB.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,920
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

19
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:45,079
Thanks for… Whoa, okay, back up a second Tracy.

20
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:47,140
That's too direct.

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,859
Can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before publication?

22
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,780
You don't want to offend her.

23
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,739
Oops, okay, you're right.

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,140
Then I can just end with all the best, Tracy.

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with yours sincerely.

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,039
That's more professional.

27
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

28
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,539
Thank you.
