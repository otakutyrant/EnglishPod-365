1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Katherine, and we have an unusual lesson for you today.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's more about writing than about speaking.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, many times we have to write emails, and if we're working in a sales environment, we may need to write an email to a potential client.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All right.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're going to learn what is appropriate and what is not in today's lesson.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Melanie, can you help me with something?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy, and I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sure, Tracy, let me just get my laptop.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All right.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
All set.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So, to whom it may concern.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I am writing ...

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So in English, you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
More relaxed.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Got it.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, Sally.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's up?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is Tracy here?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Just ...

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, Tracy.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Now it's too relaxed.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You've still got to show some respect.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How about starting with, Dear Ms.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Cooper, I'm writing to confirm ...

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Great.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Dear Ms.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisements you requested for the spring issue of Viola magazine.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's great.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to $45,600 RMB.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thanks for ...

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, okay.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Back up a second, Tracy.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's too direct.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before publication?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You don't want to offend her.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oops.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're right.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Then I can just end with, all the best, Tracy.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with, yours sincerely.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's more professional.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
All right, we're back.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Now let's take a look at some of that vocab we heard on language takeaway.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Language takeaway.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We have some wonderful adjectives today.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The first one that I wanted to discuss, Marco, is formal.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Formal.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We want to be a little bit more formal when we're writing someone we don't really know too much.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But we have to be careful because sometimes you can be too formal.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So what exactly does formal mean?

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So if you write a formal email, it's very proper, very respectful.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So proper in the way that you wouldn't use colloquial terms or phrasal verbs that you would use with your friends.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, a good example is writing to a lawyer or a judge.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You want to use formal language.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Even with a teacher, you might use more formal language.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But with a friend, you don't have to.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's something else.

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So when you're writing something that's formal, it's important to be polite as well.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now what is polite?

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Right.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So you want to be formal, you want to be serious, and you want to be polite.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You want to show respect.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You want to be nice, basically.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And so people can often be described as polite.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's very polite or she's not polite at all.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Right.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And when I was a little kid, my mom used to say, it's very important to be polite.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Always say thank you and you're welcome when you're talking to other people.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And that's one way of being polite.

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now also when we are describing the way that you speak to someone or the way that you write, you can be very direct.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now being direct means that you say exactly what you want or exactly what you're thinking.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So maybe if we're talking to this company, you say, hi, I want this.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I will pay this much.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Bye.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's maybe too direct.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So sometimes you need to be a little less direct and say nice things in an email.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's right.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So maybe you want to say to someone that you don't really like the clothes they're wearing, You say, hey, do you like my new shirt?

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And if you're very direct, you would say, no, I think it's very ugly.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I hate it.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's too direct.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So maybe you would say, I don't really think it suits you very well.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Or I think a different color would be better on you.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So that's being a little bit less direct.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Now obviously, if you're too direct with someone, you may offend that person.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
All right.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
To offend is a verb and to offend someone means to say something that makes them unhappy or upset or even angry.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So going back to the same example of the shirt, if you say, I think that shirt is very ugly, that person might be offended.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Gosh.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Or maybe if you say, you know, I think people with brown hair are so ugly and there's someone next to me with brown hair, they say, oh, I'm offended.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm not ugly, but I have brown hair.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay.

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So you don't want to offend anyone by being too direct or you don't want to have anyone feel offended.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Now for our last phrase here on language takeaway, we have towards the end of the dialogue, Tracy.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Tracy, thanks Melanie by saying you are a lifesaver.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So don't be confused.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There is also a candy called lifesavers and she's not calling her a candy.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Right.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She's saying, wow, thank you.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You really helped me.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So when someone helps you a lot, you can call them a lifesaver.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Marco, what exactly is the object, the lifesaver?

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you've ever been on a boat, you see this big orange circle that is used to throw into the water to help someone to prevent them from drowning.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That is called a lifesaver.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I'm drowning.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm having a hard time writing this email.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I do not know what to say.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Marco, you come and help me.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can say, oh, wow, thank you so much.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're a lifesaver.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's exactly right.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So we've taken a look at five key words there.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why don't we take a listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back with fluency builder.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Melanie, can you help me with something?

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Sure, Tracy.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let me just get my laptop.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Right.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
All set.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So to whom it may concern.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I am writing.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So in English, you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
More relaxed.

154
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Got it.

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey, Sally.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What's up?

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's Tracy here.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Just.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, Tracy.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now it's too relaxed.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You've still got to show some respect.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
How about starting with dear Miss Cooper?

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm writing to confirm.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Great.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dear Miss Cooper.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisements you requested for the spring issue of Viola magazine.

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's great.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The final costing, including advert design and production comes to $45,600 RMB.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Thanks for...

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Whoa.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Back up a second, Tracy.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's too direct.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before publication.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You don't want to offend her.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're right.

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Then I can just end with all the best, Tracy.

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with yours sincerely.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's more professional.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So today in Fluency Builder, we have a number of phrases you can use when you're writing an email.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Some of them are very polite and formal.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Some of them are very informal or casual.

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now this first phrase, Marco, is very, very formal, right?

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's right.

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We start our letter by stating, to whom it may concern.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
All right.

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
To whom it may concern.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Remember that M there.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
This is a very formal phrase and we're going to take it as a phrase.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is how you begin a formal letter.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Usually you start this letter if it's directed to maybe a company or someone not specific.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You don't know that person's name and you're just saying, you know, whoever's reading this letter, whoever it concerns.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, I could say, dear Marco.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But in this case, maybe I don't know who the name of the person I am writing this email to.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's a big company.

203
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There are many people.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So if you don't know who you're writing to in a company or in an organization, you say, to whom it may concern.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay.

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Now we started very formal.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Melanie said, I think it's a little bit too formal.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Maybe we should be more relaxed.

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So Tracy says, okay, got it.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So how about, hey Sally, what's up?

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What's up?

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, what's up?

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's up is the kind of thing I say with my friends.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, hey Marco, what's up?

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Right.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But I would never say this in a formal situation with a boss or with a, you know, an employer or with a more serious situation.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Exactly.

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Especially if you're writing an email to a client.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't really want to say what's up.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No, never.

222
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So remember, this is spoken English with your friends, but not something you would write.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So the key here is that you have to show some respect.

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Okay.

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So that's another great phrase.

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You show some respect.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
All right.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So the key here is that this is, the verb is to show, right?

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Not to give.

230
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You want to show respect to someone.

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, how do you show respect?

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, the way that you act, your behaviors.

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So if I'm polite and I say, you know, mister and miss and thank you and please, these are ways to show respect.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's right.

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's right.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So that's the way that you are being respectful.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You are showing respect by being very polite.

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:19,000
For example, in Japan, it is common to take your shoes off when you go to a friend's home, their house, in order to show respect to them.

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's right.

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Very good.

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Now, as we continue writing the letter, towards the end, we wanted to play it safe and just write your sincerely to close the letter off.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
All right.

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So this phrase, play it safe, what does this mean?

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When we're talking about making a decision or taking a risk, we want to play it safe.

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We want to use the less risky option.

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
All right.

247
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So the key here is that the verb is to play.

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Play it safe.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
This means that, yeah, there's maybe a risky option and a safe option and it's better to take the safe option.

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Play it safe.

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's right.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So that's the way that you would use this phrase to play it safe, to make a decision that doesn't have too much risk or that you know that will work very well.

253
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And to close things off, another option to end the letter, we could say all the best.

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
All the best, Tracy.

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All the best, Tracy.

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All right.

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So this is a way to end a letter.

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You can say sincerely or best, but it's a very nice way to end if you just say all the best and then you say, you know, after that you have a comma and then you sign your name.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's right.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All right.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Melanie, can you help me with something?

263
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy, and I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English.

264
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sure, Tracy.

265
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let me just get my laptop.

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Right.

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
All set.

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
OK, so to whom it may concern.

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I am writing.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Um, Tracy, I think that's a little too formal.

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I know you want to be polite, but you've already made contact with them.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So in English, you can be a bit more relaxed in the opening.

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
OK, more relaxed.

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Got it.

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hey, Sally, what's up?

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's Tracy here.

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Just OK, Tracy.

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now it's too relaxed.

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You've still got to show some respect.

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How about starting with Dear Miss Cooper?

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm writing to confirm.

282
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Great.

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
OK.

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Dear Miss Cooper, I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisements you requested for the spring issue of Viola magazine.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's great.

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The final costing, including advert design and production, comes to $45,600 RMB.

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We want payment 10 working days before publication, or we will cancel the ad.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Thanks for...

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Whoa.

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
OK, back up a second, Tracy.

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's too direct.

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But can I suggest you say, please note that the final payment is due two working weeks before publication?

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You don't want to offend her.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
OK, you're right.

295
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then I can just end with all the best, Tracy.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Maybe I'd play it safe and just finish with yours sincerely.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's more professional.

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, Melanie, you're a lifesaver.

299
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Thank you.

300
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So talking about ending formal emails or emails that you're writing to clients, colleagues, we can say sincerely and your name, sincerely, Marco, you can say all the best, best regards.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Now, I've noticed that some people who aren't native English speakers, sometimes they will close a letter, maybe even a formal letter, saying yours truly, Marco, for example.

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is that really appropriate for a business setting or a client?

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I would not use yours truly.

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Maybe if you're trying to build a relationship with your client and you're very honest, but it seems to me to be very personal.

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Very romantic.

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes, yours truly.

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:39,000
So I would say in that case, use sincerely or kind regards or regards, which are a little bit more professional and less emotional.

308
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
If you want to have a romantic letter, you can say, you know, all my love or love or yours truly or yours faithfully.

309
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:57,000
This is a very important topic, I think, because many times in school we do learn how to write letters, but usually they are more personal letters.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And so we memorize that usually at the end of the email or the end of the letter, you say yours, Marco, or yours truly, Marco.

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And although it is correct, it's not really appropriate for a professional setting.

312
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's right.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So just as a reminder, if you're signing off your email or your letter and you're at an office here in your company, you want to say best or best regards or some of the things that we talked about here today.

314
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Very good.

315
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
All right.

316
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So if you have any questions or any other doubts, you can always find us at EnglishPod.com and we'll see you guys there.

317
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Bye.
