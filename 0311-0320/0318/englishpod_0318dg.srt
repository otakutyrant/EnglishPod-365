00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Oh, I feel terrible.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's wrong with me?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Looks like you have a cold.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You should take some medicine.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't think it's a cold.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
An allergy?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I never thought about that.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hmm.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ow!

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I guess not.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Not funny.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, my bad.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How about dust?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This office is full of it.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You brought your cat into the office?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, it's Mr.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Snuffle's birthday today.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ah, put it away!

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I guess we found the problem.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're allergic to cats.
