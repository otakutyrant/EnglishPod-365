00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:07,860
EnglishPod.com Oh, I feel terrible.

2
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,960
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,419
What's wrong with me?

4
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:14,660
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

5
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:15,960
Looks like you have a cold.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,879
You should take some medicine.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,019
I don't think it's a cold.

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,339
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,399
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,899
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

11
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:29,519
An allergy?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,519
I never thought about that.

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:37,659
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

14
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:38,659
Hmm.

15
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,299
Ow!

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,840
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

17
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,280
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,979
I guess not.

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,340
Not funny.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,759
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,240
Okay, my bad.

22
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,240
How about dust?

23
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,479
This office is full of it.

24
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:58,740
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

25
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,920
You brought your cat into the office?

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,500
Yeah, it's Mr.

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,540
Snuffle's birthday today.

28
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,840
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,099
Ah, put it away!

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,920
I guess we found the problem.

31
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,659
You're allergic to cats.
