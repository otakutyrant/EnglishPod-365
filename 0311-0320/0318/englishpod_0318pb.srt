00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine and today we're talking about something that I think a lot of people experience, especially with certain things like peanuts and cats.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So what are we talking about?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we are talking about allergies.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So that means that we have a problem with maybe cats.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They make us sick or with certain foods.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Like a lot of people who are allergic to milk, actually.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we're going to talk about a couple of these allergies and symptoms.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So why don't we have a listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, I feel terrible.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's wrong with me?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It looks like you have a cold.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You should take some medicine.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't think it's a cold.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
An allergy?

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I never thought about that.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ow!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I guess not.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Not funny.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, my bad.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How about dust?

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This office is full of it.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You brought your cat into the office?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, it's Mr.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Snuffle's birthday today.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah, put it away!

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I guess we found the problem.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're allergic to cats.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Alright, so now let's take a look at vocab on Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright, so Marco, we have a number of things that might happen if you're feeling like you're allergic to something.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The first one is, my eyes are all watery.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so your eyes get watery, and that means you start to have a lot of water, a lot of tears in your eyes.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right, but you're not sad, you're not crying, it's just that you have this reaction that you cannot control, and the water maybe comes down from your eyes.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right, usually your eyes get wet and watery, itchy, red, so a lot of that.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There's another thing too, this happens a lot, you feel like you can't stop sneezing.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
To sneeze.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A sneeze is something you do when the air comes out of your nose.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Out of your nose, out of your mouth, out of everywhere.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, and you can't control it, and sometimes it's very, very strong.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You move your head, but it's something that you do when you're allergic to something like a cat or a flower, but also maybe when you smell something, some spice like hot pepper.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, or when you're sick, when you have a cold.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And so his friend says that maybe they should put him into quarantine.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Alright, now this is a joke.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you have allergies, you don't have to go to quarantine, but quarantine is very serious.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's a place where people go when they have a dangerous or very infectious disease, and quarantine means that no one else can come in and you cannot go out.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right, exactly, so I think when they had the pig flu, the swine flu, many people were put into quarantine to make sure they didn't give it to someone else.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right, so usually in quarantine you have to wait until you can prove that you're not sick anymore and then you get to leave.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Alright, so they were talking about maybe the options of what he's allergic to.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He says, I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, so what is pollen and where does it come from?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Alright, now pollen is actually a very common allergy and pollen comes from flowers.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's kind of like a special dust or a special kind of thing that you see on flowers that gets blown away.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So when it's springtime, many people suffer from allergies because there's a lot more pollen in the air.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So it's that little dust, usually sometimes yellow that you can find on flowers, and this is actually what butterflies and bees look for.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's right.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, and then he talked about, well, he's not allergic to bees, and his friend threw a peanut at him, but he said it in a very strange way.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He said, why did you chuck that peanut at me?

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
To chuck.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To chuck.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now this is a very spoken English way of saying something.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To chuck means to throw.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So like, Marco, why did you chuck that pillow at me?

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That was mean.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Alright, so to chuck is to throw, but usually to throw something strongly.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So as you said, it's very spoken English.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not really proper to actually write it or say it to someone in a formal occasion.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, that's right.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So you wouldn't say this in your English exam, but you could say this with your friends.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, so to chuck something.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So that's all the vocab we have for you.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
An allergy?

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I never thought about that.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hmm.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ow!

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I guess not.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Not funny.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay, my bad.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How about dust?

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This office is full of it.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You brought your cat into the office?

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, it's Mr.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Snuffle's birthday today.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ah, put it away!

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I guess we found the problem.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're allergic to cats.

109
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
All right, we're back, so now it's time for Fluency Builder.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right, now we heard a very difficult word later on in the dialogue.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Jim said, Not funny.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Right.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right, so this phrase, to go into shock, is very important.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Go into shock.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now, what does it mean to go into shock?

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, shock is something, especially anaphylactic shock, which means that I think you stop breathing because your body basically shuts down and your throat tightens so you can't breathe.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But to go into shock means that your body will kind of stop doing its normal functions.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For example, if you fall in very, very, very cold water, your body goes into shock.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Right.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And this is something that is a physical reaction.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You see it all the time in movies, I think, when a nurse or a doctor or someone yells, He's going into shock.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right?

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right, and they have to get the paddles and beep.

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Right, exactly.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So that's what it means when you go into shock, but you use this verb.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You go into shock.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's going into shock.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right, doctor.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's gone into shock.

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Uh-huh.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And, well, he said, Okay, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My bad.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He said, My bad.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What is my bad?

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
All right, my bad is another phrase that comes from spoken English, so be careful with how you use it.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is something you can use with your friends.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
My bad is a way of saying my fault or excuse me.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
My mistake.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
My mistake.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So if you do something wrong and you say, Oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake, you can just say, Oh, my bad.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Or, you know, Jerry, can we go outside for a second?

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to talk to you.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I mean, Marco, my bad.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Right, exactly.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That means, you know, my fault.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I made a mistake.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But this is very colloquial, and I think it's very juvenile, right?

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think younger people use this my bad.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
My bad.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yeah, it's younger, yeah.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's a younger.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
All right.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And for our last phrase, when Jim was talking about maybe being allergic to pollen or he said, I'm desensitized to bee stings.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
All right, so desensitized, you should know automatically that prefix D means not.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
All right, so it's negative.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm desensitized means that I'm not sensitive to.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All right.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That means that, you know, if I get stung by a bee, like me, it gets big and red and it hurts.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But this person, he doesn't have a reaction.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's desensitized.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So there's no reaction.

165
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's no red.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's no swelling.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I think you see it a lot for people that maybe live in an area where there are a lot of mosquitoes.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And if we go there, we're going to get bitten and it's going to be itchy.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But people who live there, they've been bitten so many times that they probably don't even feel it or probably don't even get bitten anymore.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They're desensitized.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Or you could say that I'm desensitized to loud noises.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
OK, I live in a city and there's a metro near my apartment.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can hear it.

175
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's very loud.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And so I'm desensitized to the noise.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That means I don't really notice it anymore.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It doesn't bother me.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Right.

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Very good.

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So that's all the vocab and phrases we've prepared for you today.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, I feel terrible.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

185
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What's wrong with me?

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Looks like you have a cold.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You should take some medicine.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't think it's a cold.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
An allergy?

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I never thought about that.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hmm.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ow!

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

199
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I guess not.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Not funny.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay, my bad.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How about dust?

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This office is full of it.

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You brought your cat into the office?

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, it's Mr.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Snuffle's birthday today.

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ah, put it away!

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I guess we found the problem.

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're allergic to cats.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Alright, so speaking about allergies, we always talk about the common ones, like pollen, dust, and you also mentioned about food, like somebody who cannot drink milk.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They're allergic to milk.

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right.

217
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We have a special name for this, actually.

218
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Someone who cannot drink milk or dairy products, like ice cream, is called lactose intolerant.

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So if you're lactose intolerant, it means that your stomach is very upset after you have dairy products, because lactose is basically dairy.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And there are some people also who are allergic to seafood, for example fish or shrimp or any type of seafood.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's right, and also people who are allergic to gluten.

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Now gluten is a very common product that is found in breads and cereal, things like that, and so people who have an allergy to gluten actually have to change their diet quite a bit.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, they have to look for things that are gluten-free, which is very hard because apparently it's in everything.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's right, so if you have one of these allergies, you can find dairy-free on the box or gluten-free on the box, and specialty food stores will have these labels.

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And so are you allergic to anything?

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No, not really.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sometimes in here, in China, I feel like I'm a little bit allergic.

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have allergies when the seasons change, but at home, no.

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have no allergies.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No allergies.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No, me neither.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm very lucky, I think, because I can't imagine if I had an allergy to peanuts or to seafood, which not only would be a shame because you can't have these foods, but if you accidentally have it, it could be life-threatening.

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

234
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Like my dad, who is allergic to bees, would go into anaphylactic shock if he were stung.

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And so you have to be very careful because you never know when you'll have an accident like that.

236
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Exactly.

237
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So this is an interesting topic.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Maybe you guys want to share if you are allergic to anything.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Maybe you are allergic to certain types of foods, chemicals.

240
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Some people are allergic to certain types of shampoo, for example.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Or fabrics like cotton.

242
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So if you want to share with us, let us know at our website, EnglishPod.com.

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We'll see you guys there.

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Bye.
