00:00:00,639 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,620
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:12,759
My name is Katherine and today we're talking about something that I think a lot of people experience, especially with certain things like peanuts and cats.

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,660
So what are we talking about?

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:14,259
That's right.

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:16,379
Today we are talking about allergies.

7
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:20,120
So that means that we have a problem with maybe cats.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,379
They make us sick or with certain foods.

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,660
Like a lot of people who are allergic to milk, actually.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,379
That's right.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,920
So we're going to talk about a couple of these allergies and symptoms.

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,299
So why don't we have a listen to our dialogue and we'll be back in a bit.

13
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,500
Oh, I feel terrible.

14
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,600
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,100
What's wrong with me?

16
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:48,320
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,579
It looks like you have a cold.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,520
You should take some medicine.

19
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,679
I don't think it's a cold.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,119
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

21
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,039
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

22
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,539
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,140
An allergy?

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,140
I never thought about that.

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,280
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

26
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:13,739
Ow!

27
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,480
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,920
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,620
I guess not.

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,980
Not funny.

31
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,420
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

32
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,879
Okay, my bad.

33
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:25,840
How about dust?

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,280
This office is full of it.

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,359
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,579
You brought your cat into the office?

37
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:39,140
Yeah, it's Mr.

38
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,200
Snuffle's birthday today.

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,459
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

40
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,719
Ah, put it away!

41
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:47,560
I guess we found the problem.

42
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,299
You're allergic to cats.

43
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,400
Alright, so now let's take a look at vocab on Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:08,020
Alright, so Marco, we have a number of things that might happen if you're feeling like you're allergic to something.

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,560
The first one is, my eyes are all watery.

46
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay, so your eyes get watery, and that means you start to have a lot of water, a lot of tears in your eyes.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:26,620
That's right, but you're not sad, you're not crying, it's just that you have this reaction that you cannot control, and the water maybe comes down from your eyes.

48
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,419
Right, usually your eyes get wet and watery, itchy, red, so a lot of that.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,400
There's another thing too, this happens a lot, you feel like you can't stop sneezing.

50
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:40,939
To sneeze.

51
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,520
A sneeze is something you do when the air comes out of your nose.

52
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,039
Out of your nose, out of your mouth, out of everywhere.

53
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,259
Yeah, and you can't control it, and sometimes it's very, very strong.

54
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:04,039
You move your head, but it's something that you do when you're allergic to something like a cat or a flower, but also maybe when you smell something, some spice like hot pepper.

55
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,400
Yeah, or when you're sick, when you have a cold.

56
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:06,900
That's right.

57
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,520
And so his friend says that maybe they should put him into quarantine.

58
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,060
Alright, now this is a joke.

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,199
If you have allergies, you don't have to go to quarantine, but quarantine is very serious.

60
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:26,259
It's a place where people go when they have a dangerous or very infectious disease, and quarantine means that no one else can come in and you cannot go out.

61
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:36,900
Right, exactly, so I think when they had the pig flu, the swine flu, many people were put into quarantine to make sure they didn't give it to someone else.

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,280
That's right, so usually in quarantine you have to wait until you can prove that you're not sick anymore and then you get to leave.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
That's right.

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,939
Alright, so they were talking about maybe the options of what he's allergic to.

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:54,180
He says, I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, so what is pollen and where does it come from?

66
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,460
Alright, now pollen is actually a very common allergy and pollen comes from flowers.

67
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,479
It's kind of like a special dust or a special kind of thing that you see on flowers that gets blown away.

68
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,120
So when it's springtime, many people suffer from allergies because there's a lot more pollen in the air.

69
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,180
So it's that little dust, usually sometimes yellow that you can find on flowers, and this is actually what butterflies and bees look for.

70
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:20,720
That's right.

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Okay, and then he talked about, well, he's not allergic to bees, and his friend threw a peanut at him, but he said it in a very strange way.

72
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,759
He said, why did you chuck that peanut at me?

73
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,399
To chuck.

74
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,519
To chuck.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,500
Now this is a very spoken English way of saying something.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,259
To chuck means to throw.

77
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,100
So like, Marco, why did you chuck that pillow at me?

78
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,060
That was mean.

79
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,600
Alright, so to chuck is to throw, but usually to throw something strongly.

80
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,540
So as you said, it's very spoken English.

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,759
It's not really proper to actually write it or say it to someone in a formal occasion.

82
00:04:58,939 --> 00:04:59,480
Yeah, that's right.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,839
So you wouldn't say this in your English exam, but you could say this with your friends.

84
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,819
Okay, so to chuck something.

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,680
So that's all the vocab we have for you.

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,019
Why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

88
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,839
An allergy?

89
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,819
I never thought about that.

90
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,980
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

91
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,000
Hmm.

92
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,620
Ow!

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,139
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

94
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,600
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

95
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,319
I guess not.

96
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:55,660
Not funny.

97
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,079
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

98
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,560
Okay, my bad.

99
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,560
How about dust?

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,819
This office is full of it.

101
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:07,060
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

102
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,259
You brought your cat into the office?

103
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,819
Yeah, it's Mr.

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,879
Snuffle's birthday today.

105
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,160
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,420
Ah, put it away!

107
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,240
I guess we found the problem.

108
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,000
You're allergic to cats.

109
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,120
All right, we're back, so now it's time for Fluency Builder.

110
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,319
All right, now we heard a very difficult word later on in the dialogue.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,819
Jim said, Not funny.

112
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,740
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

113
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:44,660
Right.

114
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,620
All right, so this phrase, to go into shock, is very important.

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,759
Go into shock.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,620
Now, what does it mean to go into shock?

117
00:06:51,620 --> 00:07:04,500
Well, shock is something, especially anaphylactic shock, which means that I think you stop breathing because your body basically shuts down and your throat tightens so you can't breathe.

118
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:09,540
But to go into shock means that your body will kind of stop doing its normal functions.

119
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,240
For example, if you fall in very, very, very cold water, your body goes into shock.

120
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:15,959
Right.

121
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,920
And this is something that is a physical reaction.

122
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:26,000
You see it all the time in movies, I think, when a nurse or a doctor or someone yells, He's going into shock.

123
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:26,720
Right?

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,319
That's right, and they have to get the paddles and beep.

125
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:30,279
Right, exactly.

126
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,980
So that's what it means when you go into shock, but you use this verb.

127
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,620
You go into shock.

128
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,680
He's going into shock.

129
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,459
That's right, doctor.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
He's gone into shock.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,759
Uh-huh.

132
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,920
And, well, he said, Okay, I'm sorry.

133
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:44,779
My bad.

134
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,040
He said, My bad.

135
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,040
What is my bad?

136
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,519
All right, my bad is another phrase that comes from spoken English, so be careful with how you use it.

137
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,040
This is something you can use with your friends.

138
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,180
My bad is a way of saying my fault or excuse me.

139
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,139
My mistake.

140
00:07:59,439 --> 00:07:59,879
My mistake.

141
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:06,500
So if you do something wrong and you say, Oh, I'm sorry, that was my mistake, you can just say, Oh, my bad.

142
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:07,439
That's right.

143
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,720
Or, you know, Jerry, can we go outside for a second?

144
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,360
I have to talk to you.

145
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:12,600
I mean, Marco, my bad.

146
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,660
Right, exactly.

147
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,379
That means, you know, my fault.

148
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:15,819
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,600
I made a mistake.

150
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,819
But this is very colloquial, and I think it's very juvenile, right?

151
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,379
I think younger people use this my bad.

152
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,120
My bad.

153
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,959
Yeah, it's younger, yeah.

154
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,560
That's a younger.

155
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:25,899
All right.

156
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:36,600
And for our last phrase, when Jim was talking about maybe being allergic to pollen or he said, I'm desensitized to bee stings.

157
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:42,679
All right, so desensitized, you should know automatically that prefix D means not.

158
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,259
All right, so it's negative.

159
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,379
I'm desensitized means that I'm not sensitive to.

160
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,019
All right.

161
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:55,919
That means that, you know, if I get stung by a bee, like me, it gets big and red and it hurts.

162
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,379
But this person, he doesn't have a reaction.

163
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,659
He's desensitized.

164
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,240
So there's no reaction.

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,080
There's no red.

166
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,799
There's no swelling.

167
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,980
I think you see it a lot for people that maybe live in an area where there are a lot of mosquitoes.

168
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,740
And if we go there, we're going to get bitten and it's going to be itchy.

169
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:21,720
But people who live there, they've been bitten so many times that they probably don't even feel it or probably don't even get bitten anymore.

170
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,700
They're desensitized.

171
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,179
That's right.

172
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
Or you could say that I'm desensitized to loud noises.

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,740
OK, I live in a city and there's a metro near my apartment.

174
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,220
I can hear it.

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,940
It's very loud.

176
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,059
And so I'm desensitized to the noise.

177
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,059
That means I don't really notice it anymore.

178
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,960
It doesn't bother me.

179
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,460
Right.

180
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,220
Very good.

181
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,200
So that's all the vocab and phrases we've prepared for you today.

182
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:46,679
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

183
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,799
Oh, I feel terrible.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,919
I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery.

185
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,379
What's wrong with me?

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,620
Wow, you're not dying, are you?

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,899
Looks like you have a cold.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,840
You should take some medicine.

189
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,980
I don't think it's a cold.

190
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,419
I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.

191
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,379
Maybe we should put you into quarantine.

192
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,860
Jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

193
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,460
An allergy?

194
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
I never thought about that.

195
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:23,600
I don't think I'm allergic to pollen, though, and I'm desensitized to bee stings after being stung so many times.

196
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:24,620
Hmm.

197
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,220
Ow!

198
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,799
Why did you chuck that peanut at me?

199
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,220
Just checking if you're allergic to peanuts.

200
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,940
I guess not.

201
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,299
Not funny.

202
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,720
I could have gone into anaphylactic shock.

203
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,200
Okay, my bad.

204
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:38,179
How about dust?

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,639
This office is full of it.

206
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,679
Yes, the whole office is dusty, yet I only feel affected near our desks.

207
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,899
You brought your cat into the office?

208
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,460
Yeah, it's Mr.

209
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,500
Snuffle's birthday today.

210
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,779
I didn't want him to be alone on his special day.

211
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,059
Ah, put it away!

212
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:59,879
I guess we found the problem.

213
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:01,620
You're allergic to cats.

214
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:17,019
Alright, so speaking about allergies, we always talk about the common ones, like pollen, dust, and you also mentioned about food, like somebody who cannot drink milk.

215
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,059
They're allergic to milk.

216
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:18,559
That's right.

217
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,220
We have a special name for this, actually.

218
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,620
Someone who cannot drink milk or dairy products, like ice cream, is called lactose intolerant.

219
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:36,600
So if you're lactose intolerant, it means that your stomach is very upset after you have dairy products, because lactose is basically dairy.

220
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:43,940
And there are some people also who are allergic to seafood, for example fish or shrimp or any type of seafood.

221
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,700
That's right, and also people who are allergic to gluten.

222
00:11:47,259 --> 00:12:00,340
Now gluten is a very common product that is found in breads and cereal, things like that, and so people who have an allergy to gluten actually have to change their diet quite a bit.

223
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah, they have to look for things that are gluten-free, which is very hard because apparently it's in everything.

224
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:15,320
That's right, so if you have one of these allergies, you can find dairy-free on the box or gluten-free on the box, and specialty food stores will have these labels.

225
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,580
And so are you allergic to anything?

226
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,679
No, not really.

227
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,600
Sometimes in here, in China, I feel like I'm a little bit allergic.

228
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,379
I have allergies when the seasons change, but at home, no.

229
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,580
I have no allergies.

230
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,200
No allergies.

231
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:30,960
No, me neither.

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:45,580
I'm very lucky, I think, because I can't imagine if I had an allergy to peanuts or to seafood, which not only would be a shame because you can't have these foods, but if you accidentally have it, it could be life-threatening.

233
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,340
That's right.

234
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,500
Like my dad, who is allergic to bees, would go into anaphylactic shock if he were stung.

235
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,500
And so you have to be very careful because you never know when you'll have an accident like that.

236
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,120
Exactly.

237
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,059
So this is an interesting topic.

238
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:01,419
Maybe you guys want to share if you are allergic to anything.

239
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:07,159
Maybe you are allergic to certain types of foods, chemicals.

240
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,679
Some people are allergic to certain types of shampoo, for example.

241
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:12,220
Or fabrics like cotton.

242
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,259
So if you want to share with us, let us know at our website, EnglishPod.com.

243
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,179
We'll see you guys there.

244
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:18,659
Bye.
