Sorry Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

Can we hang on a sec?

Well, I did say eleven o'clock sharp, and it's now five past, so...

00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,719
Hi everyone, I'm so sorry I'm late.

It's raining cats and dogs outside, and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

Right, as I was saying the subject of the meeting is...

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:41,020
Hi Maggie, I'm terribly sorry, the traffic is murder out there.

12
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:42,079
Sit down, Brono!

13
