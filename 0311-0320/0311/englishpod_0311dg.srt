Sorry Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Can we hang on a sec?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, I did say eleven o'clock sharp, and it's now five past, so...

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hi everyone, I'm so sorry I'm late.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's raining cats and dogs outside, and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay James, take a seat quickly please.

Right, the subject of the meeting is the importance.

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hi guys, please excuse me, I was held up in traffic.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Right, as I was saying the subject of the meeting is...

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hi Maggie, I'm terribly sorry, the traffic is murder out there.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sit down, Brono!

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

Who would like to start?
