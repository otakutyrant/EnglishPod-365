00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about a very important topic.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is about time.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So sometimes we are a little bit lazy or maybe we sleep too much and we're late to work or a meeting.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
All right.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So learn many different ways to talk about being late today.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, everyone.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Shall we begin?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Sorry, Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Can we hang on a sec?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp, and it's now five past, so...

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hi, everyone.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm so sorry I'm late.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's raining cats and dogs outside, and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, James, take a seat quickly, please.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Right.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The subject of the meeting is the importance.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hi, guys.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Please excuse me.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I was held up in traffic.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Right.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
As I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi, Maggie.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm terribly sorry.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The traffic is murder out there.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sit down, Bruno.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Who would like to start?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So now let's take a look at some of this vocab on language takeaway.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Language takeaway.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So, first up, we have a word that we heard.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The phrase was, I did say 11 o'clock sharp.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, so if you say the time, like 11 o'clock, and then you add sharp at the end, what does that mean?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That means exactly.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So, 11 o'clock, exactly 11 o'clock, 11-0-0, not 11-0-1, not 11-0-2, but 11 o'clock.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So if I say, I'll be there at 3 o'clock sharp.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That means you won't be there at 2.58, you will not be there at 3-0-4, you'll be there at 3 o'clock.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, so, 3 o'clock sharp.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So if you say the time and then you add sharp, it means at that exact time.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, James was late, he said he was late because he had to wait ages for a taxi.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so this might be confusing for some people, Marco, because I can say, what's your age?

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How old are you?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But here, ages has a different meaning.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So I had to wait ages means I waited a very long time.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So the word ages means for a very long time, it's always related to time in this sense.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I could say, Marco, it's so good to see you, I haven't seen you in ages.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That means I haven't seen you in such a long time.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, very good.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And now the next person, Sally, came in and she said she was held up in traffic.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, to be held up in traffic means to be stuck in traffic.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That means you were made late because there were so many cars on the road.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, so somebody or something else made you late.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right, so to be held up means to be made late.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I could ask you, Marco, why are you so late?

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What held you up?

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Exactly, what held you up.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That means what made me late.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It could be many different things.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, yeah.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it could be traffic or maybe I could be held up by the doctor, maybe he took longer than what I expected.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Or there's no elevator and I'm waiting for the elevator and I got held up by the elevator.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, very good.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And now the importance of being punctual, that's the topic of the meeting.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And so what is this word punctual?

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, so punctual is an adjective and it describes something as being on time.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So the opposite of this word would be what?

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So the opposite would be late.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Late, okay, so she's a very punctual student, she always comes to class on time.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She's never late.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Punctual, so you describe a person as being punctual or not.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, very good.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's review all this vocab, let's go back and listen to the dialogue again.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Right, the subject of the meeting is the importance.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hi guys, please excuse me, I was held up in traffic.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right, as I was saying the subject of the meeting is...

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hi Maggie, I'm terribly sorry, the traffic is murder out there.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sit down, Bruno.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who would like to start?

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right, now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Fluency Builder.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We have a lot of really great phrases today that describe, well, that are excuses for not being on time or for not being punctual.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The first one we heard was actually different though.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
One of the students said, can we hang on a sec?

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hang on a sec, okay.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So if you ask someone to hang on, that means to wait.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hang on, wait, yeah exactly, so hang on just means to wait, it's very casual.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay now if we add a sec, hang on a sec, or hang on a minute, that means wait for a little while.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A little while, a sec, S-E-C stands for second.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And it's very common in this phrase we hear hang on a sec, or wait a sec.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wait a sec, uh-huh, okay, very good.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So it's very casual, it's very spoken English, although the word sec doesn't really exist, it's just a short way of saying second.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Exactly, and later on we heard James come in, he was one of those people that we had to wait for, and he said, it's raining cats and dogs outside.

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right, okay, it's raining cats and dogs.

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So are cats and dogs falling from the sky?

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They are not, so this might sound very weird to you, this does not mean there are cats and dogs falling down from the clouds, but it does mean that it's raining a lot, it's raining really hard outside.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, very good, so it's a phrase used to say it's raining a lot, it's raining very very hard, raining cats and dogs.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So Maggie's trying to continue with the meeting as many people keep coming in and disrupting her, so she says, right, as I was saying, the subject of the meeting.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:12,000
As I was saying, now this is a really important phrase because you're going to hear this a lot in meetings or in conversations where someone is distracted, so okay, we're having, oh wait, I'm sorry, I have to talk to this person over here, when you want to come back to what you were talking about, you want to return to the topic, you say, as I was saying.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right, as I was saying, so maybe you were interrupted, maybe you got distracted, and you want to continue talking about the same topic, as I was saying, and then you continue talking.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So you return to the original point you were making.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, very good.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And well, Bruno was the last guy to come in and he said that traffic is murder out there.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay, so murder, to murder means to kill someone, but we're not talking about killing people here, we're talking about an analogy, we're saying it's as bad as murder.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So in this case, traffic is murder means traffic is really awful, it's really terrible outside.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So in what other situation or with what other noun, instead of traffic, can we use this something is murder?

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The weight is murder, so that means you have to wait a very, very long time.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, all right, very good.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So now why don't we go back to the dialogue, let's have one last review and we'll be right back.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay, everyone, shall we begin?

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sorry, Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Can we hang on a sec?

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp, and it's now five past, so...

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Hi, everyone.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm so sorry I'm late.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's raining cats and dogs outside, and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, James, take a seat quickly, please.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Right, the subject of the meeting is the importance.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hi, guys, please excuse me, I was held up in traffic.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Right, as I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

129
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hi, Maggie, I'm terribly sorry, the traffic is murder out there.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Sit down, Bruno.

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Who would like to start?

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So Marco, are you a punctual person or are you usually late?

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
For social gatherings, I'm usually pretty punctual.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For work, I'm usually very late.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've noticed you're one of the last people to come in in the morning.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, usually for work, I arrive late, but not like too late.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Some people may even be an hour or two or something, a couple minutes, 15 minutes is alright, but I do hate to wait if we agree to meet up at 2 o'clock and you come in at 2.30, I don't know, let's say to the movies, then I think that's really irritating.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I agree, I'm a very punctual person and I get very annoyed when people are late to meetings or when people come late to appointments or parties.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, and I think it's different in different countries because in many different places they have what they call the local time.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So if you say, okay, the meeting is at 9, then everyone assumes that the meeting is supposed to start at 9, but then everyone comes in at 9 but grabs a cup of coffee, talks at the cooler, gets their seat, checks their email and then the meeting will start at 9.30 instead of 9.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right, or for example, the transportation you will find in different countries can be punctual or not punctual.

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
In Germany their transportation is very famous for being punctual, but in India you will find that the trains are not very punctual, you might wait one or two or six hours for a train.

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, exactly.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So it's different in different countries.

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I imagine that in a place like Germany it would be considered a very bad thing to arrive late to a meeting, for example.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, I'm curious about that.

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So let us know, is it acceptable in your country to be a little bit late to a meeting or to an appointment?

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is punctuality important?

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let us know.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

153
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Bye.
