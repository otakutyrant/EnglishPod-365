00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,899
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:04,620
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,900
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about a very important topic.

4
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,220
This is about time.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,279
That's right.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,559
So sometimes we are a little bit lazy or maybe we sleep too much and we're late to work or a meeting.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,280
All right.

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,160
So learn many different ways to talk about being late today.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,839
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,940
Okay, everyone.

11
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,719
Shall we begin?

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,039
Sorry, Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

13
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,060
Can we hang on a sec?

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,719
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp, and it's now five past, so...

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,359
Hi, everyone.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,039
I'm so sorry I'm late.

17
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,539
It's raining cats and dogs outside, and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,179
Okay, James, take a seat quickly, please.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,119
Right.

20
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,979
The subject of the meeting is the importance.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,619
Hi, guys.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
Please excuse me.

23
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,340
I was held up in traffic.

24
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:56,579
Right.

25
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,039
As I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

26
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:00,740
Hi, Maggie.

27
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,780
I'm terribly sorry.

28
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,320
The traffic is murder out there.

29
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,120
Sit down, Bruno.

30
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,900
Okay, now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

31
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,700
Who would like to start?

32
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:20,280
So now let's take a look at some of this vocab on language takeaway.

34
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:23,719
Language takeaway.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
So, first up, we have a word that we heard.

36
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,319
The phrase was, I did say 11 o'clock sharp.

37
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:36,859
Okay, so if you say the time, like 11 o'clock, and then you add sharp at the end, what does that mean?

38
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,400
That means exactly.

39
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:47,620
So, 11 o'clock, exactly 11 o'clock, 11-0-0, not 11-0-1, not 11-0-2, but 11 o'clock.

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,000
So if I say, I'll be there at 3 o'clock sharp.

41
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:59,359
That means you won't be there at 2.58, you will not be there at 3-0-4, you'll be there at 3 o'clock.

42
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:00,079
That's right.

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,739
Okay, so, 3 o'clock sharp.

44
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,859
So if you say the time and then you add sharp, it means at that exact time.

45
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,180
Now, James was late, he said he was late because he had to wait ages for a taxi.

46
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay, so this might be confusing for some people, Marco, because I can say, what's your age?

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,599
How old are you?

48
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,439
But here, ages has a different meaning.

49
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,860
So I had to wait ages means I waited a very long time.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,639
That's right.

51
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,560
So the word ages means for a very long time, it's always related to time in this sense.

52
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,159
So I could say, Marco, it's so good to see you, I haven't seen you in ages.

53
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,080
That means I haven't seen you in such a long time.

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,719
Okay, very good.

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,659
And now the next person, Sally, came in and she said she was held up in traffic.

56
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,500
Okay, to be held up in traffic means to be stuck in traffic.

57
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,780
That means you were made late because there were so many cars on the road.

58
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,060
Okay, so somebody or something else made you late.

59
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,340
That's right, so to be held up means to be made late.

60
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,460
I could ask you, Marco, why are you so late?

61
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:10,719
What held you up?

62
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,379
Exactly, what held you up.

63
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,740
That means what made me late.

64
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,520
That's right.

65
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,840
It could be many different things.

66
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,699
Okay, yeah.

67
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:26,120
So it could be traffic or maybe I could be held up by the doctor, maybe he took longer than what I expected.

68
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,180
Or there's no elevator and I'm waiting for the elevator and I got held up by the elevator.

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,699
Okay, very good.

70
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:37,560
And now the importance of being punctual, that's the topic of the meeting.

71
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,919
And so what is this word punctual?

72
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:46,800
Okay, so punctual is an adjective and it describes something as being on time.

73
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,319
So the opposite of this word would be what?

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,819
So the opposite would be late.

75
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,300
Late, okay, so she's a very punctual student, she always comes to class on time.

76
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
She's never late.

77
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,039
Punctual, so you describe a person as being punctual or not.

78
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:06,639
That's right.

79
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,060
Okay, very good.

80
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,219
Let's review all this vocab, let's go back and listen to the dialogue again.

81
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,139
Right, the subject of the meeting is the importance.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,480
Hi guys, please excuse me, I was held up in traffic.

83
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,199
Right, as I was saying the subject of the meeting is...

84
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,480
Hi Maggie, I'm terribly sorry, the traffic is murder out there.

85
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,300
Sit down, Bruno.

86
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,100
Okay now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

87
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,860
Who would like to start?

88
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,480
All right, now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,959
Fluency Builder.

90
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:20,459
We have a lot of really great phrases today that describe, well, that are excuses for not being on time or for not being punctual.

91
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,980
The first one we heard was actually different though.

92
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,939
One of the students said, can we hang on a sec?

93
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,160
Hang on a sec, okay.

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,879
So if you ask someone to hang on, that means to wait.

95
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Hang on, wait, yeah exactly, so hang on just means to wait, it's very casual.

96
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,680
Okay now if we add a sec, hang on a sec, or hang on a minute, that means wait for a little while.

97
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,759
A little while, a sec, S-E-C stands for second.

98
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,360
And it's very common in this phrase we hear hang on a sec, or wait a sec.

99
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,779
Wait a sec, uh-huh, okay, very good.

100
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:05,000
So it's very casual, it's very spoken English, although the word sec doesn't really exist, it's just a short way of saying second.

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:15,160
Exactly, and later on we heard James come in, he was one of those people that we had to wait for, and he said, it's raining cats and dogs outside.

102
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,519
That's right, okay, it's raining cats and dogs.

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,040
So are cats and dogs falling from the sky?

104
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:33,360
They are not, so this might sound very weird to you, this does not mean there are cats and dogs falling down from the clouds, but it does mean that it's raining a lot, it's raining really hard outside.

105
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:41,319
Okay, very good, so it's a phrase used to say it's raining a lot, it's raining very very hard, raining cats and dogs.

106
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:51,019
So Maggie's trying to continue with the meeting as many people keep coming in and disrupting her, so she says, right, as I was saying, the subject of the meeting.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:12,240
As I was saying, now this is a really important phrase because you're going to hear this a lot in meetings or in conversations where someone is distracted, so okay, we're having, oh wait, I'm sorry, I have to talk to this person over here, when you want to come back to what you were talking about, you want to return to the topic, you say, as I was saying.

108
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:23,860
That's right, as I was saying, so maybe you were interrupted, maybe you got distracted, and you want to continue talking about the same topic, as I was saying, and then you continue talking.

109
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,019
So you return to the original point you were making.

110
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,259
Okay, very good.

111
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:34,500
And well, Bruno was the last guy to come in and he said that traffic is murder out there.

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:45,699
Okay, so murder, to murder means to kill someone, but we're not talking about killing people here, we're talking about an analogy, we're saying it's as bad as murder.

113
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:52,019
So in this case, traffic is murder means traffic is really awful, it's really terrible outside.

114
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,680
So in what other situation or with what other noun, instead of traffic, can we use this something is murder?

115
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,800
The weight is murder, so that means you have to wait a very, very long time.

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,199
Okay, all right, very good.

117
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:12,699
So now why don't we go back to the dialogue, let's have one last review and we'll be right back.

118
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,560
Okay, everyone, shall we begin?

119
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,860
Sorry, Maggie, but we're missing a few people.

120
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,879
Can we hang on a sec?

121
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,560
Well, I did say 11 o'clock sharp, and it's now five past, so...

122
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,199
Hi, everyone.

123
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,879
I'm so sorry I'm late.

124
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,379
It's raining cats and dogs outside, and I had to wait ages for a taxi.

125
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,019
Okay, James, take a seat quickly, please.

126
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:40,840
Right, the subject of the meeting is the importance.

127
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:45,179
Hi, guys, please excuse me, I was held up in traffic.

128
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,519
Right, as I was saying, the subject of the meeting is...

129
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:53,159
Hi, Maggie, I'm terribly sorry, the traffic is murder out there.

130
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,960
Sit down, Bruno.

131
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,700
Okay, now, as you're aware, the topic for the meeting is the importance of being punctual.

132
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,539
Who would like to start?

133
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,340
So Marco, are you a punctual person or are you usually late?

134
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:15,240
For social gatherings, I'm usually pretty punctual.

135
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,840
For work, I'm usually very late.

136
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,620
I've noticed you're one of the last people to come in in the morning.

137
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,580
Yeah, usually for work, I arrive late, but not like too late.

138
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:47,860
Some people may even be an hour or two or something, a couple minutes, 15 minutes is alright, but I do hate to wait if we agree to meet up at 2 o'clock and you come in at 2.30, I don't know, let's say to the movies, then I think that's really irritating.

139
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:57,840
I agree, I'm a very punctual person and I get very annoyed when people are late to meetings or when people come late to appointments or parties.

140
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:07,039
Yeah, and I think it's different in different countries because in many different places they have what they call the local time.

141
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:25,399
So if you say, okay, the meeting is at 9, then everyone assumes that the meeting is supposed to start at 9, but then everyone comes in at 9 but grabs a cup of coffee, talks at the cooler, gets their seat, checks their email and then the meeting will start at 9.30 instead of 9.

142
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:31,379
Right, or for example, the transportation you will find in different countries can be punctual or not punctual.

143
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:43,039
In Germany their transportation is very famous for being punctual, but in India you will find that the trains are not very punctual, you might wait one or two or six hours for a train.

144
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,299
Yeah, exactly.

145
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,379
So it's different in different countries.

146
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:55,620
I imagine that in a place like Germany it would be considered a very bad thing to arrive late to a meeting, for example.

147
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,039
Yeah, I'm curious about that.

148
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:03,580
So let us know, is it acceptable in your country to be a little bit late to a meeting or to an appointment?

149
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:05,919
Is punctuality important?

150
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:06,879
Let us know.

151
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,500
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

152
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,460
All right, we'll see you guys there.

153
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:09,840
Bye.
