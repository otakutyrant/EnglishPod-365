1
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:07,960
EnglishPod.com What can I get you?

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,460
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,619
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:12,839
That's a lady's drink.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,960
You're embarrassing me.

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,419
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,219
It's a good drink.

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,600
It's too soft.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,019
Order something with a little more kick to it.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,620
Fine.

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,179
I'll have a sex on the beach.

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,719
You have got to be kidding me.

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,420
Come on, it's delicious.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,280
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,019
Forget it.

16
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
I'm ordering for you.

17
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,619
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,020
Put it on my tab.

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,380
Here.

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,200
Now this is a real drink.

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,820
That's strong.

22
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,299
This is going to get me wasted.

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,380
That's the idea.
