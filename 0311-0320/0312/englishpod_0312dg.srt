1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com What can I get you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's a lady's drink.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're embarrassing me.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a good drink.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's too soft.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Order something with a little more kick to it.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fine.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll have a sex on the beach.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You have got to be kidding me.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Come on, it's delicious.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Forget it.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm ordering for you.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Put it on my tab.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now this is a real drink.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's strong.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is going to get me wasted.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's the idea.
