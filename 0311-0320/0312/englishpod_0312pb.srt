00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about going out for a drink.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to a bar and we're going to order cocktails.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we're going to learn all about the different types of cocktails and a little bit more language that you can use at a bar.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We'll be back in a moment.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What can I get you?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's a lady's drink.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're embarrassing me.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a good drink.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's too soft.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Order something with a little more kick to it.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Fine.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll have a sex on the beach.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You have got to be kidding me.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Come on.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's delicious, especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Forget it.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm ordering for you.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Put it on my tab.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Here.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now this is a real drink.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's strong.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is going to get me wasted.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's the idea.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All right.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're back.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So now let's take a look at some of those drinks on Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So in Language Takeaway today, we're going to focus on the names of drinks.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So we heard four of them in today's dialogue.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What was that first one, Marco?

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The first one was a Cosmo or also called a Cosmopolitan.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So this is something if you watch the TV show Sex in the City, you will have heard before because the girls always order cosmos.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now, a cosmopolitan is served in a martini glass, right?

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Right.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You've seen the martini glass.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It kind of looks like a triangle.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it's very easy to spill.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So what does a Cosmo have?

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because obviously a cocktail is a combination of different liquors or alcohol with maybe juices and stuff like that.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So what does a Cosmo have?

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's a good question.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Cosmo is a vodka drink, I believe, and it's served in a martini glass.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it's generally considered a drink for ladies, for women.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why is that?

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Probably because it's a weaker drink, but also because it's popular in the media and in movies and stuff as a women's drink.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that's how it got that reputation.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I see.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Very good.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So that's what a Cosmo is.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now, if we move on to another very popular drink, a little bit more tropical, I think everyone always has it in the Caribbean or when they're on vacation at the beach.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's called a Sex on the Beach.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This name might make you laugh because Sex on the Beach, it's very descriptive, but it's actually a very common drink.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And in the dialogue, he talks about how he likes to have this drink served in a pineapple or a coconut.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So that means it's very fruity.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I think it's a rum drink.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And it usually has either coconut juice in it or maybe some pineapple juice.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Very fruity.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Very fruity.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think even they add a little bit of vanilla or even ice cream or milk or something like that.

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So it's very fruity.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's kind of like a milkshake with liquor.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Weird.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know that I've ever had one.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But this is the part of the dialogue where his friend says, come on, you need to buy something that's more manly.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He orders a scotch on the rocks instead.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Okay.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So a scotch is a type of liquor.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a whiskey.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Scotch whiskey comes from Scotland and it's a whiskey drink.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And basically scotch on the rocks means scotch poured over ice.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So in this case, rocks means ice and you'll hear this often.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you want that on the rocks?

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you want that on ice?

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So you don't say I want whiskey with ice or you don't say I want scotch with ice.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can just say on the rocks.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Scotch on the rocks.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So it may be if you're ordering a rum drink and you don't want it mixed with anything, you can say rum on the rocks on the rocks.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Very good.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And not only are we ordering a scotch on the rocks, but we're also ordering a Manhattan.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So what does a Manhattan have?

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All right.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A Manhattan is a very strong cocktail.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It has bourbon, which is a kind of whiskey, an American whiskey.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It has vermouth, which is also a very strong ingredient.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It has bitters.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What is bitters?

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Bitters is another kind of ingredient that is often used in cocktails to make things bitter.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ah, okay.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So it's not a sweet drink.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, no, no.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's not a sweet drink.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Although they sometimes put a little bit of lemon or orange rind in the drink, and that's the skin of the orange.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So both these drinks are pretty strong.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
They're very interesting though.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All the ones that we've seen, the Cosmo, the Sex on the Beach, they're all called cocktails.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And a cocktail has the characteristic that it usually has alcohol, right?

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So cocktail is a mix of different ingredients, but is an alcohol-based drink.

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can also get non-alcoholic cocktails.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So there is that option.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All right.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Very good.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So why don't we take a break?

125
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

126
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What can I get you?

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

128
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's a lady's drink.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're embarrassing me.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What are you talking about?

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's a good drink.

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's too soft.

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Order something with a little more kick to it.

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Fine.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll have a Sex on the Beach.

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You have got to be kidding me.

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Come on.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's delicious.

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Forget it.

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm ordering for you.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll have a Scotch on the Rocks, and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Put it on my tab.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Here.

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now this is a real drink.

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's strong.

148
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is going to get me wasted.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's the idea.

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right.

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
We're back.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So now let's talk a little bit more about these drinks on Fluency Builder.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Fluency Builder.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So Marco, there are many different ways to talk about drinks, but the most important ones that we often discuss, especially with cocktails, is weak drinks versus strong drinks.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right.

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Weak drinks versus strong drinks.

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now, usually the Cosmo or maybe the Sex on the Beach, it's considered to be a weak drink.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So it's not very strong because there's less alcohol.

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Like a Cosmo has fruit juice, like cranberry juice, and the Sex on the Beach is very fruity, so it makes it less alcohol-y.

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's right.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And actually, those two also have one type of alcohol, so it's not very strong, whereas maybe a Manhattan has all this mix of bourbon and other drinks as well, so it'll be a strong alcoholic drink.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah, and Scotch on the Rocks is also very strong because it's just scotch.

164
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're not mixing it with anything.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, there's just some ice and some scotch, so that's a strong drink.

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So obviously, his friend was saying that all those drinks are too weak.

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He should order something with a little more kick to it.

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So in this context, kick means strength, so alcohol.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He wants a drink that's not weak, that's strong, so a strong drink has more kick than a weak drink.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So can we use this with food or with other situations?

172
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can, but with food, it usually means spice, so Indian food tends to have a lot of kick to it.

173
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That means it's very spicy.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, so with alcohol, it's strong.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
With food, it's usually spicy.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If this rice has a kick to it, it means it's a little spicy.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's right.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So just think about kick as meaning that something is strong or has a strong flavor.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay, very good.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now when they were ordering, they didn't pay immediately because she said, put it on my tab.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All right, so to put something on a tab.

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is really important when you're going to a bar or a restaurant and you want to order drinks.

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A tab is a bill that you don't pay immediately.

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The bartender will write down all of the drinks that you have and all of their prices, and you pay when you leave.

185
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, so if you put something on your tab, you'll pay it later or when you leave.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So normally at a bar in America, you say, I want to start a tab.

188
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That means I want to start a bill, and you give the bartender your credit card, and he will keep your credit card until you leave.

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, really?

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So he keeps your credit card until you leave because obviously, maybe you start a tab and then you want to leave and you don't want to pay, then it's a problem.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Or people get a little bit drunk and they forget they have to pay, so bartenders now keep your credit card so that even if you forget to pay, they can charge you.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, wow.

193
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Very interesting.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And now for our last phrase.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He was a little bit concerned because this drink is so strong.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He said, this is going to get me wasted.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, so to be wasted or to get wasted means to get very, very drunk.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
To drink too much.

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So if you say I'm wasted, it means I'm very drunk.

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm very drunk.

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or you could say, oh, look at those boys over there.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
They're all wasted.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They're all, you know, being drunk and sick and, yeah.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So it's a very informal, very casual, kind of a colloquial way of saying being drunk or being intoxicated.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's something we often use with friends or as, you know, with young people, but it's not something you want to use in your English class because it's not a good thing to be.

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Not a good thing to be wasted.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Very good.

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So now let's take a break and listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

213
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What can I get you?

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's a lady's drink.

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're embarrassing me.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a good drink.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's too soft.

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Order something with a little more kick to it.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Fine.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll have a sex on the beach.

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have got to be kidding me.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come on.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's delicious.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Forget it.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm ordering for you.

230
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Put it on my tab.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Here.

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now this is a real drink.

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's strong.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is going to get me wasted.

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's the idea.

237
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
All right.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So about cocktails, liquors, what is your favorite cocktail when you go out?

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I almost always order gin and tonic.

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's my cocktail.

241
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So gin is another type of liquor.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It has a very unique taste and tonic is a kind of water, but it has, you know, a certain flavor to it, right?

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It has a flavor to it.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So gin and tonic usually has some gin, some tonic water and some lime, but the tonic water is kind of a bubbly.

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's right.

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's a, it's bubbly.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So that's, I like bubbly drinks, like champagne and stuff like that.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Exactly.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I see.

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's your favorite?

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I am a whiskey guy.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And so I usually order something like this scotch on the rocks or I never like to mix it with anything else.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And especially I really don't like having sweet drinks.

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ah, so you're a purist.

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Kind of.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's just that, you know, when the sweet alcohol and things that are sweet, I don't really think go that well together.

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, I think, I think I agree, although there are some sweet alcohols.

259
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Our Italian friends will be familiar with Limoncello, which is a dessert liqueur, which tastes like lemon or also Kahlua, which is very sweet.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's kind of like, it's a coffee alcohol, right?

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So many people like to put Kahlua in their coffee to have Irish coffee.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's right.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So actually the alcoholic world is very vast and actually many people don't drink alcohol.

264
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Many people may have it occasionally.

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So but the other interesting thing is that usually countries have a national alcoholic drink.

266
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So for example, the Mexican national alcoholic drink would be tequila.

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's right.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Or Russian, Eastern European vodka.

269
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So in your country, maybe you have a local or a national alcoholic drink we would be very interested to know about.

270
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's right.

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let us know.

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We'll see you guys there.

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
All right, guys.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
See you.

276
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Bye.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Bye.
