00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,819
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,560
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about going out for a drink.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,380
That's right.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,240
We're going to a bar and we're going to order cocktails.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:18,640
So we're going to learn all about the different types of cocktails and a little bit more language that you can use at a bar.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,339
Exactly.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,280
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,559
We'll be back in a moment.

10
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,199
What can I get you?

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,600
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,039
That's a lady's drink.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,140
You're embarrassing me.

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,619
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,439
It's a good drink.

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,820
It's too soft.

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,240
Order something with a little more kick to it.

19
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:42,820
Fine.

20
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,380
I'll have a sex on the beach.

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,939
You have got to be kidding me.

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:46,920
Come on.

23
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,500
It's delicious, especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,259
Forget it.

25
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm ordering for you.

26
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:55,820
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

27
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,219
Put it on my tab.

28
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:58,579
Here.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,420
Now this is a real drink.

30
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,020
It's strong.

31
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,520
This is going to get me wasted.

32
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:04,620
That's the idea.

33
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,420
All right.

34
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:08,760
We're back.

35
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,859
So now let's take a look at some of those drinks on Language Takeaway.

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,599
Language Takeaway.

37
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,959
So in Language Takeaway today, we're going to focus on the names of drinks.

38
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,519
So we heard four of them in today's dialogue.

39
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,879
What was that first one, Marco?

40
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,239
The first one was a Cosmo or also called a Cosmopolitan.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,280
Okay.

42
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:36,359
So this is something if you watch the TV show Sex in the City, you will have heard before because the girls always order cosmos.

43
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:40,719
Now, a cosmopolitan is served in a martini glass, right?

44
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:41,040
Right.

45
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,180
You've seen the martini glass.

46
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,840
It kind of looks like a triangle.

47
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,019
And it's very easy to spill.

48
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,599
Yeah.

49
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,079
That's right.

50
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,299
So what does a Cosmo have?

51
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:59,000
Because obviously a cocktail is a combination of different liquors or alcohol with maybe juices and stuff like that.

52
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:00,040
So what does a Cosmo have?

53
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,200
That's a good question.

54
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,060
Cosmo is a vodka drink, I believe, and it's served in a martini glass.

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,159
But it's generally considered a drink for ladies, for women.

56
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:10,939
Why is that?

57
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:19,020
Probably because it's a weaker drink, but also because it's popular in the media and in movies and stuff as a women's drink.

58
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,080
So that's how it got that reputation.

59
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:20,560
I see.

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,240
All right.

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,699
Very good.

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,319
So that's what a Cosmo is.

63
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:31,719
Now, if we move on to another very popular drink, a little bit more tropical, I think everyone always has it in the Caribbean or when they're on vacation at the beach.

64
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,659
It's called a Sex on the Beach.

65
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,340
Okay.

66
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,379
This name might make you laugh because Sex on the Beach, it's very descriptive, but it's actually a very common drink.

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,800
Right.

68
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,740
And in the dialogue, he talks about how he likes to have this drink served in a pineapple or a coconut.

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,419
So that means it's very fruity.

70
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,199
And I think it's a rum drink.

71
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:53,599
Yeah.

72
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:54,039
Yeah.

73
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:59,500
And it usually has either coconut juice in it or maybe some pineapple juice.

74
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,439
Very fruity.

75
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,080
Very fruity.

76
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,080
I think even they add a little bit of vanilla or even ice cream or milk or something like that.

77
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:08,819
So it's very fruity.

78
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,439
It's kind of like a milkshake with liquor.

79
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:10,879
Weird.

80
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,340
Yeah.

81
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,719
I don't know that I've ever had one.

82
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:19,180
But this is the part of the dialogue where his friend says, come on, you need to buy something that's more manly.

83
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,319
He orders a scotch on the rocks instead.

84
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:22,860
Okay.

85
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,879
So a scotch is a type of liquor.

86
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a whiskey.

87
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:27,960
That's right.

88
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,300
Scotch whiskey comes from Scotland and it's a whiskey drink.

89
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,300
And basically scotch on the rocks means scotch poured over ice.

90
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,300
So in this case, rocks means ice and you'll hear this often.

91
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,340
Do you want that on the rocks?

92
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,039
Do you want that on ice?

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,500
Right.

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,919
So you don't say I want whiskey with ice or you don't say I want scotch with ice.

95
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,979
You can just say on the rocks.

96
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,099
Scotch on the rocks.

97
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,460
So it may be if you're ordering a rum drink and you don't want it mixed with anything, you can say rum on the rocks on the rocks.

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,020
Very good.

99
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:06,139
And not only are we ordering a scotch on the rocks, but we're also ordering a Manhattan.

100
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,740
So what does a Manhattan have?

101
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:09,520
All right.

102
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,840
A Manhattan is a very strong cocktail.

103
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,699
It has bourbon, which is a kind of whiskey, an American whiskey.

104
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,779
It has vermouth, which is also a very strong ingredient.

105
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:22,779
It has bitters.

106
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,060
What is bitters?

107
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,639
Bitters is another kind of ingredient that is often used in cocktails to make things bitter.

108
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:29,800
Ah, okay.

109
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:32,079
So it's not a sweet drink.

110
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,740
No, no, no.

111
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,480
It's not a sweet drink.

112
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:40,579
Although they sometimes put a little bit of lemon or orange rind in the drink, and that's the skin of the orange.

113
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,259
So both these drinks are pretty strong.

114
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,379
They're very interesting though.

115
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,519
All the ones that we've seen, the Cosmo, the Sex on the Beach, they're all called cocktails.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,779
And a cocktail has the characteristic that it usually has alcohol, right?

117
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,519
That's right.

118
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,839
So cocktail is a mix of different ingredients, but is an alcohol-based drink.

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,420
Okay.

120
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,399
You can also get non-alcoholic cocktails.

121
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,779
So there is that option.

122
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,279
All right.

123
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:03,860
Very good.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
So why don't we take a break?

125
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,319
Let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

126
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,160
What can I get you?

127
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:18,579
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

128
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,860
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

129
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
That's a lady's drink.

130
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,160
You're embarrassing me.

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,620
What are you talking about?

132
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,420
It's a good drink.

133
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,839
It's too soft.

134
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,240
Order something with a little more kick to it.

135
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:29,819
Fine.

136
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,319
I'll have a Sex on the Beach.

137
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,000
You have got to be kidding me.

138
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,939
Come on.

139
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,660
It's delicious.

140
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,500
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

141
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:38,279
Forget it.

142
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,500
I'm ordering for you.

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,819
I'll have a Scotch on the Rocks, and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

144
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,199
Put it on my tab.

145
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:45,579
Here.

146
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,399
Now this is a real drink.

147
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,019
That's strong.

148
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,500
This is going to get me wasted.

149
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,600
That's the idea.

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,319
All right.

151
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:55,639
We're back.

152
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,519
So now let's talk a little bit more about these drinks on Fluency Builder.

153
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,540
Fluency Builder.

154
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:12,379
So Marco, there are many different ways to talk about drinks, but the most important ones that we often discuss, especially with cocktails, is weak drinks versus strong drinks.

155
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,040
That's right.

156
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,639
Weak drinks versus strong drinks.

157
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:21,639
Now, usually the Cosmo or maybe the Sex on the Beach, it's considered to be a weak drink.

158
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,600
That's right.

159
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,759
So it's not very strong because there's less alcohol.

160
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,560
Like a Cosmo has fruit juice, like cranberry juice, and the Sex on the Beach is very fruity, so it makes it less alcohol-y.

161
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:34,240
That's right.

162
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:49,720
And actually, those two also have one type of alcohol, so it's not very strong, whereas maybe a Manhattan has all this mix of bourbon and other drinks as well, so it'll be a strong alcoholic drink.

163
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:53,540
Yeah, and Scotch on the Rocks is also very strong because it's just scotch.

164
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:53,860
Right.

165
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,899
You're not mixing it with anything.

166
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,500
No, there's just some ice and some scotch, so that's a strong drink.

167
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,360
So obviously, his friend was saying that all those drinks are too weak.

168
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:07,800
He should order something with a little more kick to it.

169
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,199
So in this context, kick means strength, so alcohol.

170
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,480
He wants a drink that's not weak, that's strong, so a strong drink has more kick than a weak drink.

171
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,759
So can we use this with food or with other situations?

172
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:31,620
You can, but with food, it usually means spice, so Indian food tends to have a lot of kick to it.

173
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,339
That means it's very spicy.

174
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,139
Okay, so with alcohol, it's strong.

175
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,600
With food, it's usually spicy.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,120
If this rice has a kick to it, it means it's a little spicy.

177
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:42,759
That's right.

178
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,579
So just think about kick as meaning that something is strong or has a strong flavor.

179
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,899
Okay, very good.

180
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:57,300
Now when they were ordering, they didn't pay immediately because she said, put it on my tab.

181
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,660
All right, so to put something on a tab.

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,319
This is really important when you're going to a bar or a restaurant and you want to order drinks.

183
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:09,319
A tab is a bill that you don't pay immediately.

184
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,899
The bartender will write down all of the drinks that you have and all of their prices, and you pay when you leave.

185
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:21,379
Okay, so if you put something on your tab, you'll pay it later or when you leave.

186
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:21,860
That's right.

187
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,079
So normally at a bar in America, you say, I want to start a tab.

188
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,800
That means I want to start a bill, and you give the bartender your credit card, and he will keep your credit card until you leave.

189
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,399
Oh, really?

190
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,580
So he keeps your credit card until you leave because obviously, maybe you start a tab and then you want to leave and you don't want to pay, then it's a problem.

191
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:46,059
Or people get a little bit drunk and they forget they have to pay, so bartenders now keep your credit card so that even if you forget to pay, they can charge you.

192
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:46,659
Oh, wow.

193
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:47,080
Okay.

194
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:48,299
Very interesting.

195
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:49,679
And now for our last phrase.

196
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,059
He was a little bit concerned because this drink is so strong.

197
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,799
He said, this is going to get me wasted.

198
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,960
Okay, so to be wasted or to get wasted means to get very, very drunk.

199
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:02,799
To drink too much.

200
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,759
So if you say I'm wasted, it means I'm very drunk.

201
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm very drunk.

202
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,980
Or you could say, oh, look at those boys over there.

203
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,039
They're all wasted.

204
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,559
They're all, you know, being drunk and sick and, yeah.

205
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:15,919
Okay.

206
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,620
So it's a very informal, very casual, kind of a colloquial way of saying being drunk or being intoxicated.

207
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:22,299
That's right.

208
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:30,580
So it's something we often use with friends or as, you know, with young people, but it's not something you want to use in your English class because it's not a good thing to be.

209
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,080
Not a good thing to be wasted.

210
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,539
Okay.

211
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:33,600
Very good.

212
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,460
So now let's take a break and listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

213
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,139
What can I get you?

214
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,539
I'll have a Cosmo, please.

215
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,759
Dude, you can't order a Cosmo.

216
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
That's a lady's drink.

217
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,080
You're embarrassing me.

218
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,539
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,360
It's a good drink.

220
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,740
It's too soft.

221
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,120
Order something with a little more kick to it.

222
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,740
Fine.

223
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,299
I'll have a sex on the beach.

224
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,860
You have got to be kidding me.

225
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,840
Come on.

226
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,580
It's delicious.

227
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:06,399
Especially when served with a pineapple or a coconut.

228
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,200
Forget it.

229
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,440
I'm ordering for you.

230
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:11,740
I'll have a scotch on the rocks and my friend here will have a Manhattan.

231
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,139
Put it on my tab.

232
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,500
Here.

233
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,340
Now this is a real drink.

234
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,960
That's strong.

235
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:19,440
This is going to get me wasted.

236
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:20,559
That's the idea.

237
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,299
All right.

238
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,500
So about cocktails, liquors, what is your favorite cocktail when you go out?

239
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,340
I almost always order gin and tonic.

240
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:32,279
That's my cocktail.

241
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,039
So gin is another type of liquor.

242
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,139
That's right.

243
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:46,259
It has a very unique taste and tonic is a kind of water, but it has, you know, a certain flavor to it, right?

244
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,100
It has a flavor to it.

245
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,639
So gin and tonic usually has some gin, some tonic water and some lime, but the tonic water is kind of a bubbly.

246
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,460
That's right.

247
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,899
It's a, it's bubbly.

248
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,179
So that's, I like bubbly drinks, like champagne and stuff like that.

249
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:01,700
Exactly.

250
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,379
I see.

251
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,200
What's your favorite?

252
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:05,620
I am a whiskey guy.

253
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:13,440
And so I usually order something like this scotch on the rocks or I never like to mix it with anything else.

254
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,419
And especially I really don't like having sweet drinks.

255
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,139
Ah, so you're a purist.

256
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,179
Kind of.

257
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:26,639
It's just that, you know, when the sweet alcohol and things that are sweet, I don't really think go that well together.

258
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,340
No, I think, I think I agree, although there are some sweet alcohols.

259
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:43,600
Our Italian friends will be familiar with Limoncello, which is a dessert liqueur, which tastes like lemon or also Kahlua, which is very sweet.

260
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,039
It's kind of like, it's a coffee alcohol, right?

261
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,299
So many people like to put Kahlua in their coffee to have Irish coffee.

262
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,159
That's right.

263
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,059
So actually the alcoholic world is very vast and actually many people don't drink alcohol.

264
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:02,860
Many people may have it occasionally.

265
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,120
So but the other interesting thing is that usually countries have a national alcoholic drink.

266
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:14,840
So for example, the Mexican national alcoholic drink would be tequila.

267
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:15,899
That's right.

268
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,620
Or Russian, Eastern European vodka.

269
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:27,840
So in your country, maybe you have a local or a national alcoholic drink we would be very interested to know about.

270
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,539
That's right.

271
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,080
Let us know.

272
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:30,700
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

273
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,620
We'll see you guys there.

274
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,200
All right, guys.

275
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:32,620
See you.

276
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:32,879
Bye.

277
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,080
Bye.
