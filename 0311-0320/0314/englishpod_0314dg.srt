You have a collect call from Tommy.

Would you like to accept the charges?

00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes, of course.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Dad?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, Tommy.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What happened?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you okay?

Yeah, Dad.

Everything is okay.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for me to go to my friend's house today after school.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, sure.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No problem.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You scared me to death.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've told you to make a collect call in case of an emergency only.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the payphone.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sorry, Dad.
