Dad?

00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,200
Yeah, Tommy.

What happened?

Everything is okay.

00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,560
I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for me to go to my friend's house today after school.

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:52,640
Yeah, sure.

No problem.

You scared me to death.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,920
I've told you to make a collect call in case of an emergency only.

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,960
Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

25
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:04,480
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the payphone.

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,400
Sorry, Dad.
