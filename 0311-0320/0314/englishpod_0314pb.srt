00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're making a phone call.

4
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:13,199
That's right, we are making a special type of phone call, we're making a collect call.

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:22,160
So we will explain what this means, let's listen to the dialogue, let's see if you can more or less guess what a collect call means, and we'll be right back.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,600
This is the operator, how may I help you?

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,100
Yes, I would like to make a collect call.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,539
Okay sir, please dial the number.

9
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:45,939
Now, please state your name.

10
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:46,960
Tommy.

11
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,240
Please wait a moment.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,420
Hello, you have a collect call from Tommy, would you like to accept the charges?

13
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,700
Yes, of course.

14
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,459
Dad?

15
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,680
Yeah Tommy, what happened, are you okay?

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,939
Yeah Dad, everything is okay, I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for me to go to my friend's house today after school.

17
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, sure, no problem.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,700
You scared me to death.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,319
I've told you to make a collect call in case of an emergency only.

20
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,299
Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,879
I ran out of credit, and I also didn't have 25 cents for the pay phone.

22
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:26,819
Sorry Dad.

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,439
Alright, so we're back, we've got a number of words and phrases to look at, let's check out our words in Language Takeaway first.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,599
Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,400
Alright, so as we mentioned, we are making a collect call, so what exactly is a collect call?

26
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:56,799
Alright, well a collect call is a phone call you make when you don't have any money, and the phone company charges the person who answers the phone.

27
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:57,319
Okay.

28
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, so if I call my mom with a collect call, my mom pays.

29
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:02,840
Not you.

30
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,420
Not me.

31
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,359
And you can do this pretty much from any phone, right?

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,860
That's right, you can do this from any phone, normally people use pay phones to do this, but there is one condition that is important with a collect call.

33
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,439
The person who answers the phone, they have to say that it's okay that they pay.

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,039
Okay, you can't just use this with anybody.

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Okay, very good.

36
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,199
So actually when the guy was making this collect call, the operator asked him to dial the number.

37
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,120
Okay, so this is an important verb that we have with making a telephone call.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,319
You make a call, but with the number, the phone number, you actually have to dial it.

39
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:40,759
Right.

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,439
And that comes from those old phones where you don't push the numbers, you pull them.

41
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,060
Yeah, you had to spin the little wheel.

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,539
Yeah, there's circles and you pull the numbers and spin the wheel around, but the verb now is to dial a number.

43
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,080
To dial a number, that's right.

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:04,819
Okay, so you dial your number and, well actually, as we said, you're making this collect call because maybe you don't have any money.

45
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,740
In this case, sometimes in your mobile phone, you have what we call credit.

46
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,360
This is an important word, this is a noun, you have it or you don't have it.

47
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,599
On my phone, for example, I have a lot of credit, but maybe if I don't have any credit, I run out of credit.

48
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:25,379
I don't have any money left, I can't make a phone call.

49
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,800
That's right, so this is what it means when you have credit in your phone.

50
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,599
It means that you have some money with the telephone company, so when you make a call, they discount it from there.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,020
But if you don't have any more credit, you can't make any phone calls.

52
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,419
Exactly, so basically credit represents money.

53
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,280
That's right.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,139
Okay, and as you said, a collect call, you usually make from a payphone.

55
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,539
So what is a payphone?

56
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:55,659
Okay, well we have phones at people's houses, those are regular phones, and we have cell phones which you can carry around.

57
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Well, payphones are public phones that you have to use money in order to make a call on.

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,300
Okay, so usually you will see these at airports, for example.

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,819
Airports, train stations, any big public place where people need to use phones.

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:19,019
They're less common now in some places, but basically you have to put the coins, the money coins, into the phone to get the phone to work.

61
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,360
If you don't have any money, you can't make a call.

62
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,579
Yeah, that's right.

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,839
Okay, so four key words there.

64
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:29,060
Why don't we take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

65
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,420
This is the operator.

66
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,360
How may I help you?

67
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,839
Yes, I would like to make a collect call.

68
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:45,939
Okay, sir.

69
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:47,139
Please dial the number.

70
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:52,720
Now, please state your name.

71
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,699
Tommy.

72
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,980
Please wait a moment.

73
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,139
Hello, you have a collect call from Tommy.

74
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,139
Would you like to accept the charges?

75
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,399
Yes, of course.

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,220
Dad?

77
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,339
Yeah, Tommy.

78
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:12,879
What happened?

79
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,420
Are you okay?

80
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,220
Yeah, Dad.

81
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,139
Everything is okay.

82
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:19,699
I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for me to go to my friend's house today after school.

83
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,779
Yeah, sure.

84
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,720
No problem.

85
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:23,459
You scared me to death.

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,079
I've told you to make a collect call in case of an emergency only.

87
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,040
Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

88
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,620
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the pay phone.

89
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:33,540
Sorry, Dad.

90
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,959
Alright, now we're going to talk a little bit more about the phrases we found in this dialogue on Fluency Builder.

91
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:52,839
So this first phrase is a phrase that you might encounter in many different situations, but today's situation is making a collect call.

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,959
So we heard this phrase, please state your name.

93
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:56,860
That's right.

94
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,860
So you have a verb here, to state your name, state your age.

95
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:07,399
And that basically means to tell us, tell me or tell us what is your name.

96
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:08,139
That's right.

97
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,759
So if I say, hey, you, state your name.

98
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,920
Uh-huh, that means I have to say my name, Marco, for example.

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,779
So you can use it for name, for age.

100
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,480
Yes, state your birthday, please.

101
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,540
So this is often what we have to do when we're on the phone with a service company.

102
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,740
So the bank will ask us, what is your, you know, state your birthday, please, or state your last name, or state your phone number.

103
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,980
They want to confirm our personal information.

104
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:32,639
Okay.

105
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:36,959
And well, as we heard it, so once you do all this, you make a collect call.

106
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:44,819
The person on the other side has to accept, and this is when the operator said, would you like to accept the charges?

107
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,339
In this case, to accept the charges means to offer to pay, okay?

108
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:57,660
So if you accept the charges, that means that the phone company will ask you for money when your bill comes.

109
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:58,399
That's right.

110
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:06,420
So you accept to be charged with money, or you accept the charges that come with this telephone call.

111
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,060
That's right.

112
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:07,680
All right.

113
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,899
And now the dad finally says, are you okay?

114
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,399
You know, is everything all right?

115
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,019
And apparently it was a very trivial thing.

116
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,339
He just called to make sure that he can go to his friend's house, and the dad said, you scared me to death.

117
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,180
Okay, parents often use this phrase in English.

118
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,839
This means, you had me very worried.

119
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,600
I was so worried, so you scared me to death.

120
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,500
That doesn't mean that the father died.

121
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:32,899
Right.

122
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,120
It means he was very, very, very scared.

123
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,079
Right, exactly.

124
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:42,660
So it's a phrase, a little bit obviously with exaggeration, but very common to hear, you scared me to death.

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,040
You scared me a lot.

126
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,779
Yes.

127
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,300
And why did he scare him to death?

128
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,680
Because he told his son to make a collect call in case of an emergency only.

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
Okay, so this phrase, in case of an emergency, is a fixed phrase.

130
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,819
You can see this on the metro, you can see this on the bus, but also you can hear this in conversation.

131
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:13,220
And so, in case of an emergency means only when there is an emergency situation, a fire, an accident, something like that.

132
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:14,240
That's right.

133
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:23,720
Maybe on a train you have seen, or on an airplane, you have a big red button or a lever that says, pull in case of emergency.

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,800
That means, don't pull it now, but pull it if there's a serious problem.

135
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,600
That's right.

136
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,220
So the father says, you know what, I told you only make a collect call in case of an emergency.

137
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:42,940
That means if there's an accident, if the boy's in the hospital, if there is something serious happening, then it's okay to charge to make this collect call.

138
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,879
But other times, like, you know, you forgot your wallet.

139
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,720
That's not an emergency.

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,100
Yeah.

141
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:49,539
All right, very good.

142
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:53,320
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be right back.

143
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:05,860
This is the operator.

144
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,779
How may I help you?

145
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,279
Yes, I would like to make a collect call.

146
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:10,360
Okay, sir.

147
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,700
Please dial the number.

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,100
Now, please state your name.

149
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,139
Tommy.

150
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,419
Please wait a moment.

151
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,679
Hello.

152
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,580
You have a collect call from Tommy.

153
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,600
Would you like to accept the charges?

154
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,860
Yes, of course.

155
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,639
Dad?

156
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,759
Yeah, Tommy.

157
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:37,320
What happened?

158
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:37,860
Are you okay?

159
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,659
Yeah, Dad.

160
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,580
Everything is okay.

161
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,139
I'm calling you because I want to know if it's okay for me to go to my friend's house today after school.

162
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:45,200
Yeah, sure.

163
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,179
No problem.

164
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,899
You scared me to death.

165
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,500
I've told you to make a collect call in case of an emergency only.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Why didn't you call me from your mobile phone?

167
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,059
I ran out of credit and I also didn't have 25 cents for the pay phone.

168
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:57,960
Sorry, Dad.

169
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,600
So making a collect call, very common thing as well.

170
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:13,759
This is the scenario you will find in the United States, for example, if you go to a pay phone, you don't have any money, you want to call your friend, the tour guide, the airport, anything.

171
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,419
You can make a collect call.

172
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,159
That's right.

173
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:20,860
And this is something that is, like I said, becoming less common with cell phones.

174
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,639
But generally speaking, if you don't have any money and you have an emergency situation or you need to call someone, it's very important.

175
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,460
Then you can make a collect call.

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,220
You dial 0 for the operator and you say, I want to make a collect call.

177
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,360
And they will ask you these important questions.

178
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,779
And then what the other person hears is, you know, Catherine would like to make a collect call.

179
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,559
Right, exactly.

180
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,860
Will you accept the charges?

181
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,179
And, you know, if you're my mother, you'll say yes, of course.

182
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,480
That's right.

183
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:51,159
Now, as you said, pay phones, they used to be all over the place and you would have to put in a quarter.

184
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,679
This is why the kid said that he didn't have any money for the pay phone.

185
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,100
But now you don't really see too many pay phones.

186
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,700
Everyone's got mobile phones.

187
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,539
That's right.

188
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,919
And pay phones are less and less common, although a lot of people like to use pay phones just because they're private, not tracked.

189
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,519
Yeah.

190
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:14,279
But what I found is that the airports now, you can't use a pay phone with quarters or money.

191
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,639
Now you've got to use a credit card to use a pay phone.

192
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,120
That's right.

193
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,720
It's become so expensive that you have to swipe your credit card to use the pay phone.

194
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,000
So it's a changing world, Marco.

195
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,340
Now, can we make international collect calls?

196
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,779
I don't think so.

197
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,080
I think it's just America.

198
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,740
OK.

199
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,919
Well, this is a very interesting topic.

200
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:39,000
Obviously, we will see if in your country you can make collect calls or how do you make a call to someone if you don't have any money?

201
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,980
That's a good question.

202
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,759
So let us know.

203
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,440

204
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,179
We'll see you guys there.

205
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:43,519
Bye.
