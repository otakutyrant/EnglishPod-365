00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,919
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,680
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:09,339
My name is Katherine, and today we have another episode in our series all about small talk.

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:10,039
That's right.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:17,980
Today we're going to take a look at a work setting where two colleagues maybe run into each other and they talk very briefly about something.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:18,379
All right.

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,120
So let's check out today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:27,600
Hi, Michelle.

9
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,879
Do you need to use the photocopier?

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,559
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

11
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:31,719
No, please.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,340
Go ahead.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,460
So, how are you, Jeremy?

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,399
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,320
Oh, I'm fine.

16
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:38,740
Thanks.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,659
I'm super busy with work, actually.

18
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,799
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

19
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,479
No.

20
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,399
Tell me more.

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,420
Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill, and he said that they met the head of Lawson's last week.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,039
And?

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:53,159
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,119
Fingers crossed.

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,859
That's great news, Jeremy.

26
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,060
Congratulations.

27
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,520
Anyway, I must get back, but give my regards to your wife, Monica.

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,659
I will, Michelle.

29
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,899
Speak to you soon.

30
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,700
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,799
So now let's take a look at some vocab on language takeaway.

32
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,019
Language takeaway.

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,480
So the first word for you guys today is photocopier.

34
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,640
Now this is something that's very common in offices.

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,500
That's right, a photocopier, also known as a copy machine or just copier.

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,980
Yeah, this is something that you use to print on paper or to copy paper.

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,299
So if I have a document, but I want another copy of it, I put it on this machine and it will copy it and print it out.

38
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:39,939
That's right.

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,959
So those are the ways that you know this machine by this name, either photocopier, copy machine, or just copier.

40
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,780
All right, but after that, we have a very interesting adjective.

41
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,599
This is something that we use very often in spoken English.

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,159
The phrase here, Marco, was I'm super busy, but what does it mean to say you're super something?

43
00:01:59,459 --> 00:01:59,840
That's right.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,659
So when we add the word super to an adjective, we mean that we're very, very, very busy.

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,680
Super busy.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,319
All right, so I'm super hungry.

47
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,599
That means you're very, very, very hungry.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,159
Or I'm super woman.

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,719
Also, it means that you are very much a great woman.

50
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,699
All right, like Superman is very good at going fast and doing things, and so he's super means great or exceptional.

51
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,500
So in this case, I'm exceptionally busy.

52
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,460
That's right.

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,800
And moving on to the next line where Jeremy says that he was discussing the contract with Bill.

54
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,159
So a contract, we know what this means.

55
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, what is this?

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:45,080
So a contract is a document, and it's something that you have to have two or more groups for or two or more parties.

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,659
So Marco, between you and me, we could have a contract.

58
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,379
It says that when we come to record, you will be respectful of me.

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,060
That's right.

60
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,139
And then we will both sign.

61
00:02:53,479 --> 00:03:04,099
So it's kind of an agreement between two, as you said, or more people, but you are promising to respect the contract and to do what the contract says.

62
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,080
And if you don't do what the contract says, we have a special verb.

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,780
We say you broke the contract, so to break, break a contract.

64
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,539
That's right.

65
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:19,159
Well, Jeremy was discussing the contract with Bill, and they said they met the head of Lawson's.

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,060
Now Lawson's is a company that we're just using for the dialogue, but what does it mean, the head of this company?

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,819
Okay, well, if you think about the company as a body, the head is the top.

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,219
And in this case, that would be the president or the manager or the leader.

69
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,699
It's the most important person.

70
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:43,599
Okay, so we can also use this in our offices, for example, the person in charge of marketing, the director of marketing.

71
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,699
We also call him the head of marketing.

72
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:54,740
Or the head of the sales division would be the manager of the sales team or whoever's most important in sales.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,599
Another very common example, I think, is the president.

74
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,780
Many times they call him the head of state.

75
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,060
Yeah, the head of state.

76
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,560
So you can have a dinner with many heads of state.

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,120
And those could be kings or queens or presidents.

78
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,159
Very good.

79
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,520
All right, so that's all the vocab for language.

80
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,719
Take away, why don't we take a short break and listen to the dialogue again.

81
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,339
Hi, Michelle, do you need to use the photocopier?

82
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

83
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,779
No, please go ahead.

84
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,920
So how are you, Jeremy?

85
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,839
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

86
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:30,779
Oh, I'm fine.

87
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,180
Thanks.

88
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,100
I'm super busy with work, actually.

89
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,240
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

90
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,819
No, tell me more.

91
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,160
Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill.

92
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,879
And he said that they met the head of Lawson's last week.

93
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,459
And?

94
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,600
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

95
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,540
Fingers crossed.

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,259
That's great news, Jeremy.

97
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,519
Congratulations.

98
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,800
Anyway, I must get back.

99
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,939
But give my regards to your wife, Monica.

100
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,079
I will, Michelle.

101
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,240
Speak to you soon.

102
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,399
All right, we're back.

103
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,560
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,199
Fluency Builder.

105
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,720
So there's a great phrase here in Fluency Builder that we use when we're trying to be polite in English.

106
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,540
Michelle says, oh, hi, Jeremy.

107
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:14,040
Please go ahead.

108
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,420
OK, so Jeremy asked if she needs to use the photocopier.

109
00:05:19,459 --> 00:05:20,980
And he said, no, Jeremy, it's OK.

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,480
Go ahead.

111
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:22,379
Please go ahead.

112
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,279
OK, this literally means you go ahead of me.

113
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,420
But in reality, she's basically saying, I can wait.

114
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,480
You go first.

115
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,000
So if you're going into a building and somebody opens the door before you and they say, please go ahead.

116
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,579
That means they'll hold the door and you can go inside first.

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,600
So please go ahead.

118
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,879
This is a very polite thing to do.

119
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:51,360
And if you're in line and you see someone is in a hurry, you can say this to them, please go ahead.

120
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:52,980
All right, very good.

121
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,319
Please go ahead.

122
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,680
And we also, going back to the contract, discussed about confirming the deal, OK?

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,860
All right, so you have a deal or an agreement or a contract.

124
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,839
But the thing you do to make sure that you all agree is you confirm.

125
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,680
So this means you want to make sure it is actually going to happen.

126
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,620
And you can actually combine confirm with many different things.

127
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,300
Like you can confirm your tickets to go to Italy.

128
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,100
Or can we confirm those holidays before I make my bookings?

129
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,740
Because I want to go to Italy.

130
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,379
So you confirm something.

131
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,699
And then Jeremy said a very strange phrase here, fingers crossed, after talking about the deal.

132
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,759
OK, so fingers crossed is an interesting phrase.

133
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,139
It doesn't mean, OK, now go cross your fingers.

134
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:44,699
But it's something we say to be superstitious.

135
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,019
Because it means basically, I hope so, or hopefully.

136
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,279
Because fingers crossed, when you cross your fingers in many Anglo-American cultures, you are saying that you hope something will happen.

137
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:57,980
It's to bring good luck.

138
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,459
All right, so, oh gosh, I really hope it doesn't rain today.

139
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
And then I say fingers crossed.

140
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,019
Yeah, well, fingers crossed it doesn't.

141
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,860
That means that we hope it doesn't.

142
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,579
But now that you said that, maybe it will.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,459
Right, right.

144
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's kind of a superstitious belief that people have that if you cross your fingers, it will bring good luck.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,399
Or what you say will happen will happen or won't happen.

146
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,600
That's right, fingers crossed.

147
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,120
All right, so let's take a break now and listen to our dialogue one last time.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,699
Hi, Michelle, do you need to use the photocopier?

149
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,379
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

150
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,120
No, please, go ahead.

151
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,279
So how are you, Jeremy?

152
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,199
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

153
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,480
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

154
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,459
I'm super busy with work, actually.

155
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,579
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

156
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:51,160
No, tell me more.

157
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,199
Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill, and he said that they met the head of Lawson's last week.

158
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:56,779
And?

159
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,939
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

160
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,899
Fingers crossed.

161
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,600
That's great news, Jeremy.

162
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,860
Congratulations.

163
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,139
Anyway, I must get back.

164
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
But give my regards to your wife, Monica.

165
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,420
I will, Michelle.

166
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,600
Speak to you soon.

167
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:28,040
So this is a very common scenario in an office, in a normal office setting, where maybe you meet your friend in the kitchen, or the water cooler, the photocopier, and you have very small, brief conversations.

168
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,339
That's right.

169
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:37,759
And you're often going to hear this called water cooler talk, because you don't want to have a long conversation about something really deep at the water cooler.

170
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:47,639
