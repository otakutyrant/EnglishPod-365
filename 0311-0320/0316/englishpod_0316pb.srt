00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have another episode in our series all about small talk.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we're going to take a look at a work setting where two colleagues maybe run into each other and they talk very briefly about something.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
All right.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So let's check out today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hi, Michelle.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you need to use the photocopier?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No, please.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Go ahead.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, how are you, Jeremy?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, I'm fine.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thanks.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm super busy with work, actually.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Tell me more.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill, and he said that they met the head of Lawson's last week.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And?

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fingers crossed.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's great news, Jeremy.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Congratulations.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Anyway, I must get back, but give my regards to your wife, Monica.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will, Michelle.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Speak to you soon.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So now let's take a look at some vocab on language takeaway.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Language takeaway.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So the first word for you guys today is photocopier.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now this is something that's very common in offices.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's right, a photocopier, also known as a copy machine or just copier.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, this is something that you use to print on paper or to copy paper.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So if I have a document, but I want another copy of it, I put it on this machine and it will copy it and print it out.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So those are the ways that you know this machine by this name, either photocopier, copy machine, or just copier.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All right, but after that, we have a very interesting adjective.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is something that we use very often in spoken English.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The phrase here, Marco, was I'm super busy, but what does it mean to say you're super something?

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So when we add the word super to an adjective, we mean that we're very, very, very busy.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Super busy.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right, so I'm super hungry.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That means you're very, very, very hungry.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or I'm super woman.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Also, it means that you are very much a great woman.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, like Superman is very good at going fast and doing things, and so he's super means great or exceptional.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So in this case, I'm exceptionally busy.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And moving on to the next line where Jeremy says that he was discussing the contract with Bill.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So a contract, we know what this means.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, what is this?

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So a contract is a document, and it's something that you have to have two or more groups for or two or more parties.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So Marco, between you and me, we could have a contract.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It says that when we come to record, you will be respectful of me.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then we will both sign.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So it's kind of an agreement between two, as you said, or more people, but you are promising to respect the contract and to do what the contract says.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And if you don't do what the contract says, we have a special verb.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We say you broke the contract, so to break, break a contract.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, Jeremy was discussing the contract with Bill, and they said they met the head of Lawson's.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Now Lawson's is a company that we're just using for the dialogue, but what does it mean, the head of this company?

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, well, if you think about the company as a body, the head is the top.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And in this case, that would be the president or the manager or the leader.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's the most important person.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, so we can also use this in our offices, for example, the person in charge of marketing, the director of marketing.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We also call him the head of marketing.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Or the head of the sales division would be the manager of the sales team or whoever's most important in sales.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Another very common example, I think, is the president.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Many times they call him the head of state.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yeah, the head of state.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So you can have a dinner with many heads of state.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And those could be kings or queens or presidents.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Very good.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right, so that's all the vocab for language.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Take away, why don't we take a short break and listen to the dialogue again.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hi, Michelle, do you need to use the photocopier?

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No, please go ahead.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So how are you, Jeremy?

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, I'm fine.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thanks.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm super busy with work, actually.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, tell me more.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And he said that they met the head of Lawson's last week.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And?

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Fingers crossed.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's great news, Jeremy.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Congratulations.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anyway, I must get back.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But give my regards to your wife, Monica.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will, Michelle.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Speak to you soon.

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right, we're back.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Fluency Builder.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So there's a great phrase here in Fluency Builder that we use when we're trying to be polite in English.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Michelle says, oh, hi, Jeremy.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Please go ahead.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
OK, so Jeremy asked if she needs to use the photocopier.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And he said, no, Jeremy, it's OK.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Go ahead.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please go ahead.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OK, this literally means you go ahead of me.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But in reality, she's basically saying, I can wait.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You go first.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So if you're going into a building and somebody opens the door before you and they say, please go ahead.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That means they'll hold the door and you can go inside first.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So please go ahead.

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is a very polite thing to do.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And if you're in line and you see someone is in a hurry, you can say this to them, please go ahead.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, very good.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Please go ahead.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And we also, going back to the contract, discussed about confirming the deal, OK?

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right, so you have a deal or an agreement or a contract.

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But the thing you do to make sure that you all agree is you confirm.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So this means you want to make sure it is actually going to happen.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And you can actually combine confirm with many different things.

127
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like you can confirm your tickets to go to Italy.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Or can we confirm those holidays before I make my bookings?

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Because I want to go to Italy.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So you confirm something.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And then Jeremy said a very strange phrase here, fingers crossed, after talking about the deal.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
OK, so fingers crossed is an interesting phrase.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It doesn't mean, OK, now go cross your fingers.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But it's something we say to be superstitious.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because it means basically, I hope so, or hopefully.

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Because fingers crossed, when you cross your fingers in many Anglo-American cultures, you are saying that you hope something will happen.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's to bring good luck.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All right, so, oh gosh, I really hope it doesn't rain today.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then I say fingers crossed.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, well, fingers crossed it doesn't.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That means that we hope it doesn't.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But now that you said that, maybe it will.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Right, right.

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's kind of a superstitious belief that people have that if you cross your fingers, it will bring good luck.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Or what you say will happen will happen or won't happen.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right, fingers crossed.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, so let's take a break now and listen to our dialogue one last time.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hi, Michelle, do you need to use the photocopier?

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, hi, Jeremy.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No, please, go ahead.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So how are you, Jeremy?

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I was talking to Linda about you only last week.

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm super busy with work, actually.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Did you hear about the Lawson contract?

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, tell me more.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, I was discussing the contract with Bill, and he said that they met the head of Lawson's last week.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And hopefully they're going to confirm the deal on Wednesday.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Fingers crossed.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's great news, Jeremy.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Congratulations.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Anyway, I must get back.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But give my regards to your wife, Monica.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I will, Michelle.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Speak to you soon.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So this is a very common scenario in an office, in a normal office setting, where maybe you meet your friend in the kitchen, or the water cooler, the photocopier, and you have very small, brief conversations.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And you're often going to hear this called water cooler talk, because you don't want to have a long conversation about something really deep at the water cooler.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
