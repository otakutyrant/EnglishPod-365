00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we have another episode in our series about small talk.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So small talk, Marco, is what exactly?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Quick little conversation that you have maybe with a colleague or friend or even with a stranger maybe in the elevator, just about the weather or some small little topic.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So you're not talking about the meaning of life.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're talking about the weather or food.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So let's check out today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a minute to talk more about what's going on.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So nice of you.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My pleasure, miss.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Actually, could you recommend what to eat here?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've never been here before.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sure.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious, and it's the healthiest thing on the menu.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I usually get that.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, thanks for the suggestions.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No, don't mention it.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right, we're back.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So as we saw in this dialogue, it's a small talk conversation with two strangers who are actually buying some food.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So this is something that could happen if you are waiting in line at a supermarket, if you're at the bank or even at a shop, like in this case.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Exactly.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This kind of conversation happens all the time.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So let's take a look at some words and phrases in today's Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right, so the first word that we have for you today is the gentleman, the older person, noticed how wet the girl was.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
She said, you are soaked.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All right, so it's raining outside and he says, oh, dear miss, you are soaked.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
All right, this is an adjective.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It describes what she looks like.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So if you are soaked, it means that you are a little bit wet.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Very wet.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Very wet.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know, you can say that someone is a little wet, but if they're soaked, it means their shoes, their pants, their shirt, their hat, everything is very wet.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
OK, you are soaked.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And so it's an adjective, even though it has an ed ending, it may look like a verb or in the past, but it's not.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's an adjective with an ed ending.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it's raining outside.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This woman is very wet.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She's soaked.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
She's wet.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And she says, I have to rush.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have to hurry because of what?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because I'm on my lunch break.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She's on her lunch break.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OK, so during work, we might have something called a break.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is a short time when we don't have to work.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Five minutes, 10 minutes.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And the break that we have at lunch when we get to eat is a little bit longer.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So we call this a lunch break.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So usually people have their lunch break, let's say at noon or one o'clock, and it's usually an hour, like you say.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right, an hour.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
OK, so she's on her lunch break and that's why she's in a hurry.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And so the other guy let her go in front of him and he asked her for some suggestions.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What is good here?

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What do you recommend to eat?

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So he's not familiar with the food, but the woman is.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And she says, well, the avocado sandwich is delicious.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Now let's talk about this fruit because it is a fruit, right, Marco?

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a fruit, an avocado.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You see this, it looks like a big green pear, more or less.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, it's green on the inside and it's dark on the outside.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So to eat it, you have to take off the skin.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yeah, that's right.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And inside it's kind of buttery almost.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not hard like a banana or an apple.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's kind of more very, very soft.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You can take it out with a spoon.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's very, very delicious.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And it's very common in a lot of Latin cooking where you have, for example, guacamole in Mexican cooking, which is made primarily of avocados.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So she recommends the avocado sandwich and then she goes on to describe some of the food.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And now here we're going to take a look at some adjectives, but in a superlative form.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
For example, she said it's the healthiest thing on the menu, this sandwich.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
OK, so this is a really important point, Marco, and I'm glad you brought it up.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can say that this food is healthy.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That means it's good for my body.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But if I say that it's the healthiest, what does that mean?

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
How is that different from healthy?

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Basically, you're saying that it's the on the list of things that are at the restaurant, maybe that are healthy.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is the most healthy.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But you don't say most healthy.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You say healthiest, healthiest.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK, so is chocolate cake the healthiest thing on the menu?

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, probably not.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's probably the least healthy.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So on top, we have the healthiest thing on the menu.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We also have another superlative.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We heard the word tastiest.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Right.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This comes from the adjective tasty.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Something is delicious.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's tasty.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It tastes good.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But here we're saying that it's the thing that tastes the best, the tastiest choice.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
OK, so I think that the avocado sandwich is the tastiest.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That means I think it's the best thing you can eat.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And that's another one, actually.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Best is another superlative, but it's a little bit different because it's not an is, is, is.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's not like tastiest or healthiest.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's just best.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Right.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're saying that it's the number one.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So the best milkshake in town, like in this dialogue.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Or you say the best soccer player in the world is so-and-so.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So this comes from the adjective good.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So we have good, which is not bad, and the best, which is the most good, right?

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah, exactly.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But you don't say the most good.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You say the best.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's the best.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So maybe Ronaldo is one of the best soccer players in the world.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Exactly.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All right.

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So now let's take a break.

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's take a look at everything again, and we'll be right back with Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So nice of you.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you very much.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My pleasure, miss.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Actually, could you recommend what to eat here?

130
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I've never been here before.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Sure.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious, and it's the healthiest thing on the menu.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I usually get that.

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, thanks for the suggestions.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, don't mention it.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
All right, we're back.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So now let's take a look at three phrases we picked out on Fluency Builder.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Fluency Builder.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So a great phrase here, something that we often hear in conversation, polite conversations.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The older man says, I'm in no hurry.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now, what does this mean?

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Does this mean he needs to go somewhere?

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, he says, you know what?

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I really don't have to go anywhere fast.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's why he let her, the girl, get in front of him in line at the shop.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
All right, so basically it means I can wait.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can wait, yeah.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So if somebody says, oh, I'll be right back.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Please wait a moment.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can say, I'm in no hurry.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Take your time.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
OK, so I'm in no hurry means it's not that important.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't have to go fast.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Right.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But if you change the no and you say I'm in a hurry, then that means that you have to go fast.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on, Marco.

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Speed it up.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm in a hurry.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In a hurry.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So just changing those two words, that gives you a completely different meaning.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And well, the girl, Michelle, she said, oh, that's so nice of you.

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you very much.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And he says, my pleasure.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So this is an alternative to the phrase, you're welcome.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OK, this is a very polite way to say you're welcome.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And so when we hear her thank him for something, you know, thank you for letting me go ahead of you.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He says, my pleasure.

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is a great, great phrase for you guys.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Exactly.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So now you have another alternative instead of saying you're welcome or no problem or don't mention it.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now you have it's my pleasure.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is a little bit more formal, but you can use it in any circumstance.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And as I said, another option here is the is the phrase don't mention it, which means exactly the same thing.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're welcome.

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's right.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So the older gentleman says thanks for the suggestions.

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thanks for your help.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And what does the young woman say?

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't mention it.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't mention it.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So this is more colloquial.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is a little bit more spoken language.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
She's saying no problem.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're welcome.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So you have you're welcome.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No problem.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My pleasure.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't mention it.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All ways of saying the same thing.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
All right.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So let's take another listen to our dialog.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We'll be back in a moment.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, dear Miss.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are soaked.

200
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wow.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's really raining heavily outside.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes, it sure is.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I had to run here from work.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, please, why don't you go ahead of me in line?

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm in no hurry.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, that's so nice of you.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Thank you very much.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My pleasure, Miss.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Actually, could you recommend what to eat here?

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've never been here before.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Sure.

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious and it's the healthiest thing on the menu.

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I usually get that.

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town.

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, thanks for the suggestions.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, don't mention it.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All right, we're back.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So talking about the superlatives, I know it's a complicated subject because grammar wise, it can be a little bit difficult to determine when do you say, for example, beautiful.

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Do you say more beautiful or do you say beautifulest?

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You say more beautiful.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, I don't really have a hard and fast rule for everyone.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's one of those things that you learn while you're studying English and you just have to remember.

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, there are some exceptions, but usually you can guide yourself by adjectives that have usually three or more syllables.

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You probably have to use most or more.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Right, you don't say amazingest.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Most amazing.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Most amazing or more amazing.

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What about funny?

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Funny.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So then you say funnier or funniest.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Or sad.

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can say saddest.

236
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
All right, so sad, funny.

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
These are one and two syllables.

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Sad, funny, saddest, funniest.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You can use this ending.

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But with the words like beautiful or amazing, there are three syllables.

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They're long.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You have to say most amazing, most beautiful.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, and there are some exceptions to the rule.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You may find them.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But usually if you see an adjective that's a little bit long like this, you can just say you can just use more for the comparative or most for the superlative.

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
All right, so lots of stuff there.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
