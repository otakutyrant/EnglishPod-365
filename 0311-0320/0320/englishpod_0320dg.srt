00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:12,000
EnglishPod.com I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try, and I have been here for two years already.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
An MBA, hey?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The business schools won't be interested in me.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Nonsense!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
GMAT?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What does that stand for, and what will the test contain?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Graduate Management Admission Test.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It contains three parts.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Analytical writing assessment, the quantitative section, and the verbal section.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
How am I supposed to practice for this?

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Up to you.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You can also use free or private computer software.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Going to church might help as well.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Uh, that's the spirit.
