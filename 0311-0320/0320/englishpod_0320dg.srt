00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:12,400
EnglishPod.com I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try, and I have been here for two years already.

2
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,080
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

3
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,100
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,339
An MBA, hey?

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,480
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,160
The business schools won't be interested in me.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:24,940
Nonsense!

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,280
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,160
GMAT?

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,219
What does that stand for, and what will the test contain?

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,479
Graduate Management Admission Test.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,420
It contains three parts.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,679
Analytical writing assessment, the quantitative section, and the verbal section.

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,920
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

15
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,179
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,619
How am I supposed to practice for this?

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,539
Up to you.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,679
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

19
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:02,100
You can also use free or private computer software.

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,400
Going to church might help as well.

21
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,379
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

22
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,480
Uh, that's the spirit.
