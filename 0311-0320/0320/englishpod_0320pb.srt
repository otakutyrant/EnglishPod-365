00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,279
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:12,359
My name is Katherine, and today we have a special dialogue for you all about this important test that you need for going to graduate school.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,099
That's right.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,839
Today we're going to talk about the famous or very scary GMAT.

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:28,239
All right, so the GMAT, G-M-A-T, is the test that students will take when they want to go to graduate school for business management, so an MBA program.

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

8
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:36,420
It's a pretty much a standard test that you have to take, as you say, to get into one of these programs.

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,780
Today, we're going to talk a little bit about the sections of the test and more or less how it's structured, but not too much in depth.

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,259
That's right.

11
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,700
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

12
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,859
We'll be back in a moment.

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,619
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try, and I have been here for two years already.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,420
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

15
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:05,480
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

16
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,700
An MBA, hey?

17
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,819
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,459
The business schools won't be interested in me.

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,299
Nonsense.

20
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,640
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

21
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:17,519
GMAT?

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,560
What does that stand for, and what will the test contain?

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,799
Graduate Management Admission Test.

24
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,780
It contains three parts.

25
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,040
Analytical writing assessment, the quantitative section, and the verbal section.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,280
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,540
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,980
How am I supposed to practice for this?

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,900
Up to you.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,959
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,439
You can also use free or private computer software.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,739
Going to church might help as well.

33
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,760
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

34
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,859
Uh, that's the spirit.

35
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,519
All right, we're back, so now let's talk about some of the language we found on Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,460
Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,560
All right, so there's a lot of great stuff here.

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,020
The first one we've got is actually more about a job than school.

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,439
This is the career ladder.

40
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:26,340
That's right, Ash is complaining how he can't seem to make any progress in the career ladder.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,400
So what is a career ladder?

42
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,919
We know what a ladder is.

43
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,740
A ladder is a tool that you use to climb from a low place to a high place.

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,379
So for example, if you want to go on the roof of your house, you have to use a ladder.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,300
A career ladder is like an analogy.

46
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:47,460
When you start a career, you start at the bottom and you climb up, up, up to the top.

47
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,939
So going from the bottom to maybe the president of an organization.

48
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:52,819
So that's called the career ladder.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,699
Yeah, climbing from the bottom of a career area, like for example, being the mailman at an office building to being the president of that office.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay, so this is what Ash is complaining about, that it's hard or he can't really seem to go up the career ladder.

51
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:15,300
And so Mindy suggests that he should take the GMAT and go into graduate school.

52
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,240
So as we said, the GMAT is a test that you take, but what does it stand for?

53
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,219
What is GMAT?

54
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,919
GMAT stands for Graduate Management Admission Test, okay?

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,680
So that's the test that you take when you want to go to school.

56
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:36,120
So you have to send your scores to the admissions office of the school you want to go to and they will decide if they're high enough or not.

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,199
Okay, very good.

58
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,960
So not everyone can go to graduate school and you have to take this test and pass it, basically.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,580
Well, there's no pass-fail, but certain schools will say that a score is high enough and other schools will say that a higher score is more important.

60
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:54,879
So you can maybe go to a better school if you have a better score.

61
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:00,159
And well, Mindy went on to explain the three parts of this test.

62
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,120
The first one she said is analytical writing.

63
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,979
Alright, so analytical writing is a very common part of a test.

64
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:14,620
For example, I think the SAT also has analytical writing and basically you're asked to read something and then write about it.

65
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,860
And analytical means that you have to really use your mind to make an argument.

66
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,019
It's not just read and repeat, read and repeat.

67
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,339
Right.

68
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,500
So it basically comes from analyzing.

69
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:25,139
Yes.

70
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,579
You analyze what you read and then you write about it.

71
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:34,839
That's right, you have to think and you have to make, you have to understand what you read and then you have to write something that makes, you know, makes sense.

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,480
It's logical.

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,560
Do you put your opinion in analytical writing?

74
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:37,899
No.

75
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,480
No, so it's all based on facts.

76
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,680
Based on facts and logic and argument.

77
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,980
Uh-huh, okay.

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:51,100
So you have this part of analytical writing and then Mindy talks about the quantitative section of the test.

79
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,319
So what is this?

80
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,259
So the quantitative section, you think of the word quantify, quantity, quantitative has to do with numbers.

81
00:04:59,540 --> 00:04:59,879
Okay.

82
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,579
Math basically.

83
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:10,699
So you have to be able to understand basic math, some algebra, some arithmetic, some statistics for example.

84
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,279
So quantitative sections on tests are the math sections.

85
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:24,139
Now, from my understanding, even though it is a math section, it's not really like they give you a problem, an equation and you have to solve it.

86
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,300
It's more like analysis, right?

87
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,620
They give you some information and you have to use math to solve it.

88
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:31,579
That's right.

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,199
So there are a number of different parts.

90
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,579
One of them is like what you say.

91
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:40,980
It's kind of a, it's about logic while using algebra to solve these problems.

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,540
I think the other part of it has to do with statistics and being able to understand trends, graphs, things like that.

93
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,199
So this is the math section of the exam.

94
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,339
So not only do you have to be able to read, understand and analyze what you're reading, you have to be able to be good at math.

95
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,420
And then finally we have a verbal section.

96
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,180
What is this all about?

97
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,879
This is about your English language and grammar skills.

98
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,139
So the verbal section will test your vocabulary knowledge.

99
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:09,899
Do you understand what big words mean?

100
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,560
Also will test your ability to read passages and analyze them.

101
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:22,560
So I guess this part is the most important, one of the most important parts for foreign students who obviously don't speak English as their first language.

102
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,139
This makes sure that you have a good enough English level to be able to take a graduate program in English, right?

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,740
Part of it's that there's a special test that will test your English abilities, but this is absolutely an important part for a non-native English speaker on the GMAT.

104
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,720
It's hard for English speakers who are born speaking English, you know, native English speakers, yeah.

105
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,879
So it's something that really you should devote your time to if you are a non-native English speaker because there will be some very challenging words there.

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,139
Okay, so those are the three sections of the GMAT.

107
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,540
And so to finish off language takeaway, Ash said that he's going to take this test because he wants to become a corporate fat cat.

108
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,980
Alright, now this is an interesting term.

109
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,040
This is not something we talk about in the office.

110
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,879
This is something we talk about with friends.

111
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,100
So a corporate fat cat, you think corporate corporation has to do with business.

112
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:13,480
So basically we're talking about very important businessmen.

113
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,839
But fat cat's not a good thing, right?

114
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,079
No it's not really.

115
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:36,759
You refer to a fat cat, a corporate fat cat, as a businessman who you consider to have a lot of money, but obviously you make the analogy that they're fat because they have so much money and it's kind of a way of saying that businessmen are not the, corporate fat cats are not the best people around.

116
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,360
No, you're basically saying that these guys, these men on top, they're rich, but they're kind of lazy.

117
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,980
And so he wants to be a corporate fat cat.

118
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:48,379
He wants to be very rich and powerful and not have to work so hard.

119
00:07:49,120 --> 00:08:01,000
Which obviously is not really the case always, but this is a common term that, as you said, you wouldn't really mention it in the office, but it's more of a satirical way of speaking about businessmen.

120
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:08,139
All right, so now let's finish off Language Takeaway and move on to some phrases on Fluency Builder.

121
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,879
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try.

122
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,040
And I have been here for two years already.

123
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,860
Well, have you thought of getting an MBA?

124
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,959
I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

125
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,120
An MBA, hey?

126
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,279
Well, my degree wasn't in business.

127
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,920
The business schools won't be interested in me.

128
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,740
Nonsense.

129
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,059
The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT.

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,960
GMAT?

131
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,980
What does that stand for and what will the test contain?

132
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,299
Graduate Management Admission Test.

133
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,200
It contains three parts.

134
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,419
Analytical Writing Assessment, the Quantitive section, and the Verbal section.

135
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:56,700
Not only does the test score you on the number of questions answered, but also on the difficulty.

136
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,379
How am I supposed to practice for this?

138
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,299
Up to you.

139
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,360
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

140
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,860
You can also use free or private computer software.

141
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,159
Going to church might help as well.

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,139
No matter what I do, I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

143
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,259
Uh, that's the spirit.

144
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,919
Alright, in Fluency Builder today we have a number of really great phrases you can use.

145
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,580
The first one is from Mindy.

146
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,019
She says, I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top.

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,399
Right.

148
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,820
She suggests getting an MBA.

149
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,940
I heard it does wonders to improve your career.

150
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:39,740
This is actually something that you might hear in a commercial.

151
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
It does wonders means it really helps.

152
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,379
It's really beneficial to you.

153
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,879
You might hear it in a commercial, for example, with a face cream.

154
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,559
It does wonders to your skin.

155
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,639
It really makes your skin look good.

156
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:05,879
By using this phrase, it does wonders, you're basically saying it's fast, it's effective, it's almost a miracle of how much it can improve your career, or in this case of the cream, how it can improve your face.

157
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:06,600
That's right.

158
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,259
So the MBA does wonders, it's almost miraculous how positive and effective it will have on your career.

159
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,659
Okay.

160
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:14,940
It does wonders.

161
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:21,120
And then Ash was asking how he's supposed to study for this, and Mindy answered, well, you know what?

162
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,980
It's up to you.

163
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:23,539
You have a lot of options.

164
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,100
So up to you.

165
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,919
Up to you.

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,059
This means it's your decision, okay?

167
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,419
So we can use this in normal life, you know, you and I are out, Marco, and I say, well, I don't know what to eat.

168
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,100
What do you want to eat?

169
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:36,159
I can say, oh, whatever.

170
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:36,759
It's up to you.

171
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,620
Up to me.

172
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,539
That means I get to decide what we eat, and I want pizza.

173
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:41,899
Okay, very good.

174
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,360
So up to you is a way to say, no, you decide.

175
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,820
It's up to you.

176
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,659
It's your decision.

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,159
And for our next phrase, Ash was saying that he's going to study really hard, and he's going to ace the test.

178
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,240
All right.

179
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:59,620
Now, to ace a test, this is a phrase that we use.

180
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,259
We can use it in high school and college as well, not just MBA programs.

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,840
And to ace a test means to do perfectly on it.

182
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,399
Okay.

183
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,600
Okay, that means to get an A or even 100%.

184
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:15,860
So it's important to remember that we have this grading system, A, B, C, D, F.

185
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,059
A is the top.

186
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:17,740
All right.

187
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,320
And so you ace it means you don't make any mistakes, and remember that A for ace.

188
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Okay.

189
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,700
So you can even use it if it's not really a test, like a job interview, you say, I aced that job interview.

190
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,480
I aced it.

191
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:40,559
And in sports, oftentimes, we see this tennis, it's a sports analogy, tennis, when someone serves a ball, and the other player can't even hit the ball back, it's an ace, you get the point.

192
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,179
That's right.

193
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:48,120
So it's an ace for that, or even good sports athletes, do you call them aces?

194
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,659
Aces.

195
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,679
So after a job interview, I can say, you know, wow, Marco, I really aced that interview.

196
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,480
I aced it.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,039
Okay.

198
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,580
And Mindy says, Well, you know what?

199
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:57,759
That's really good.

200
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,639
That's the spirit.

201
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,200
That's the spirit.

202
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,320
Now, this is something you say to someone when you like their attitude.

203
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:03,960
Okay.

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,179
So if I say, Oh, man, I did really bad.

205
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:08,200
This is stupid.

206
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,240
I don't want to study.

207
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,600
You say, Well, that's the bad attitude, right?

208
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,600
But if I say, You know what, I'm going to do awesome.

209
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,259
This is great.

210
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,740
I'm so I'm going to kill this.

211
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,580
I'm going to ace it.

212
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,299
No, you could say that's the spirit.

213
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,299
That's the spirit.

214
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,639
That means good attitude.

215
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,440
That's the right way to think about this.

216
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,740
So you're kind of even encouraging that person.

217
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,659
You're saying you know what, I really like your attitude.

218
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,539
That's the good way of thinking.

219
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,120
Exactly.

220
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,120
So if you want to if you want to push someone and say, you know, good, good for you.

221
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,580
This is a good way to approach it.

222
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,159
You say that's the spirit.

223
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:37,419
Okay, awesome.

224
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,559
So this is all the language that we have for fluency builder.

225
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,279
Why don't we take a break and we'll be right back.

226
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:33,799
Okay, this sounds a little tough.

227
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,200
How am I supposed to practice for this?

228
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,139
Up to you.

229
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:41,200
You could have a one-on-one session with a tutor or group sessions.

230
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,659
You can also use free or private computer software.

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,000
Going to church might help as well.

232
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,519
No matter what I do.

233
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat.

234
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,059
That's the spirit.

235
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,059
All right, we're back.

236
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,279
So now talking about the GMAT and an MBA, this seems to be a very popular topic nowadays.

237
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:13,299
Everyone wants to get obviously a good education and go to graduate school, which means getting your master's degree or your doctoral degree.

238
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,080
What do you think about the GMAT and the MBA?

239
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,620
Is it a miracle worker like this girl says she does?

240
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,679
Wow, it does wonders for your career.

241
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,820
Do you think that's really the case?

242
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,059
I don't know.

243
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,659
You know, maybe if you asked me five years ago, I would say yes.

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,700
But I really believe that it depends on the person.

245
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,039
Nothing is a miracle cure.

246
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,860
I do think that if you really have a good attitude and you work hard, you'll get a lot out of it.

247
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,460
But if you think it's going to get you a job, you're wrong because you have to get yourself a job.

248
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,220
So I think it depends on the person.

249
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,460
Now obviously also it depends on the country, right?

250
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:57,820
Now how popular or how important is it for people to have, let's say, an MBA to get ahead in business in the United States?

251
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,340
I'd say it's pretty important.

252
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,659
You don't have to have an MBA.

253
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:04,679
I mean, you can start your own business and if you're successful, you'll probably start more businesses.

254
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:13,139
But getting an MBA is also a very good opportunity to network, to meet people, to find out more about the industry that you want to start out in.

255
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,879
And so I think in that sense, it's pretty important because it's a way to start making contacts.

256
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,500
Yeah, you definitely meet a lot of people with work experience from different backgrounds, international students.

257
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,120
So it's obviously a great thing.

258
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:35,720
But obviously to be able to do one of these programs, like get an MBA, you have to take these tests, which I understand are very, very difficult.

259
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,460
They are very difficult and it can be very expensive.

260
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,440
I mean, graduate school itself is $100,000, $200,000.

261
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,159
And then to prepare for the tests, you could spend another $1,000 just getting classes or tutoring.

262
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:59,919
So I do think that it can be a lot of money up front, but there are places that you can go to to study and you could even study on your own using your computer.

263
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:00,980
Yeah, exactly.

264
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:13,919
I think this is a very interesting topic because in many different cultures, in many different places, education or, for example, higher learning, like getting an MBA, has different levels of importance.

265
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,000
Like in Europe, a lot of Europeans maybe don't really even pay too much attention to getting an MBA.

266
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,000
Whereas in other countries, they might really emphasize like, you have to have an MBA.

267
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,740
It's really good.

268
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:24,980
It's going to be good for your career.

269
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,740
So it's very interesting to see how in different places they handle it.

270
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,480
It is interesting.

271
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,419
And I'm actually very curious to hear from our users.

272
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,200
Have you ever thought about getting an MBA?

273
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,600
Are MBAs important to do business in your country?

274
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,419
Let us know.

275
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,960
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

276
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,259
All right.

We'll see you guys there.

278
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,240
Bye.
