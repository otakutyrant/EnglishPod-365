EnglishPod.com Hey Susan, have you got a sec?

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,019
I have some questions about my paycheck.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,460
You bet, Emily.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,240
Pull up a chair.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,300
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States, and there are a few things I don't understand.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,399
First off, what is this FICA and SUI SDI tax?

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,839
And why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

8
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,479
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,700
This number here represents your gross pay.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,700
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

11
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,420
Then here we have a series of deductions.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,659
First off are the federal ones.

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,579
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,259
It's your federal income tax.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:56,500
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,679
Alright, I see.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,700
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now?

18
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

19
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,980
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

20
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:16,840
There's the state income tax, and then this SUI SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,540
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,420
Yeah, I don't mind giving them $1.50 for that.

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,299
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

24
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:29,439
That's right.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Not all states have an income tax.

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,140
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,379
I see.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,340
Alright, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,560
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,959
Thanks for your help, Susan.

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,900
No problem.

32
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,760
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,180
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

34
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,420
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

35
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,120
I just never paid much attention.

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,959
See you later.
