EnglishPod.com Hey Susan, have you got a sec?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I have some questions about my paycheck.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You bet, Emily.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Pull up a chair.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States, and there are a few things I don't understand.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
First off, what is this FICA and SUI SDI tax?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This number here represents your gross pay.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then here we have a series of deductions.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First off are the federal ones.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's your federal income tax.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Alright, I see.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There's the state income tax, and then this SUI SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I don't mind giving them $1.50 for that.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's right.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Not all states have an income tax.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I see.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Alright, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thanks for your help, Susan.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No problem.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I just never paid much attention.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
See you later.
