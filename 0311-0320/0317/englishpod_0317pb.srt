00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very complicated topic for you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is an upper intermediate lesson, a little bit more difficult, and we're talking all about taxes, paychecks, and all the information for when you work in the United States.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It confuses me, and I'm American, so take a close listen.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to listen to this dialogue one time, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's going on.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I have some questions about my paycheck.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You bet, Emily.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Pull up a chair.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States, and there are a few things I don't understand.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
First off, what is this FICA and SUISDI tax, and why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This number here represents your gross pay.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Then here we have a series of deductions.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
First off are the federal ones.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's your federal income tax, and then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
All right, I see.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's right.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There's the state income tax, and then this SUISDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, I don't mind giving them $1.50 for that.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Not all states have an income tax.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I see.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
All right.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thanks for your help, Susan.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No problem.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I just never paid much attention.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
See you later.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, we're back.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So obviously a lot of vocab there, a lot of acronyms as well, like FICA and all that stuff.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We'll take a look at that in a little bit.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
First, let's start off with some language on Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Language Takeaway.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So when you get paid, there's a very important number you want to look at, or a couple of numbers.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
These are called deductions.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Now, why do deductions make people sad, Marco?

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because a deduction is to take away or reduce.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So obviously if your salary is, let's say, $1,000 and you have $500 deductions, then you only get five instead of $1,000.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right, so deductions mean what money is being taken away from you, all right?

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's the money that's deducted for certain taxes or certain programs.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's important to remember that deduct to deduct is the opposite of to add.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It means to take away.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
To take away, that's right.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So Emily had some questions about her salary, and so she brought her pay stub to Susan to ask her, why are all these deductions?

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why am I not getting all my salary?

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So pay stubs are very important pieces of paper.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Basically when you go to a store and you buy something, you get a receipt.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Well, when you go to work and you get paid, you get a receipt for your payment.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That means that it shows you how much money you earn and all of these deductions.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So if you're paid every month, you get a paid stub every month.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you're paid every two weeks, you get a pay stub every two weeks.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So it's basically a little receipt that tells you you have been paid and how much you were paid.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right, so Susan started explaining about her gross salary and her net salary.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
All right, and these are the two most important numbers on your pay stub.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
On your pay stub, it will say gross pay, not gross like icky gross, but like total.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So in total, you earn $1,000 a month, but that's not how much money you have in your bank because the money that you earn is actually a little bit different because of these deductions we mentioned.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So the net pay is the actual amount of money you get to keep.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Right.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So the company will pay $1,000, but with taxes and all these deductions, the actual money that you get is less, and that's called the net pay.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So it's important when you're looking at these numbers, look at your gross pay.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is that correct?

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And then afterwards, look at your net pay.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is that what money you actually received?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right, so now getting into a little bit of taxes and the type of taxes that we have out there, not considering the taxes for the salary, this is a different one.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We have a property tax.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So some places in America tax you on the amount of money you earn at your job, but a lot of others like to collect taxes from different areas.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So property tax is one of those.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If you own land, if you own a house or a condo, you will pay a property tax every year.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Every year you have to pay for owning this property.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's right.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Because basically you're paying the state for the land that you have, or the space that you have.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And the bigger your house is, the bigger the land is, the more money you pay.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And you have to pay the same value every year, or does it change over time?

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It can change over time.

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You hear this sometimes.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Property taxes are, or property value increases, and so then property tax will probably increase as well.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And what about sales tax?

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think this is very straightforward, but how does it work?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Well, it's straightforward, Marco, but I don't think they have this in many other places in the world.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
China, for example, we don't really have a sales tax, so people don't have to worry about it.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But a sales tax is a small tax that you pay every time you buy something.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If I buy a TV and the TV is $100, it's possible that the sales tax is 3%, I pay $103.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So that's another way that you are taxed, not on how much money you make, but on the purchases that you make.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It makes sense.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If I buy a lot of cool things, cars, TVs, I'm paying more money to my state to provide services like schools and roads and things like that.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Uh-huh.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So a lot of interesting things here.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think we can move on now to specifically talking about the taxes related to people's salaries or how it works in the United States.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is, remember that we are talking specifically about the United States here, so let's take a look at that now on Fluency Builder.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Fluency Builder.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right, so one of the scary acronyms here, Marco, was FICA.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The FICA.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
FICA.

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It looks very strange here.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What is this FICA?

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Well, this is an acronym.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And remember, acronyms are words that stand for other words.

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So F, federal, I, insurance, C, contribution and A, act.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So Federal Insurance Contribution Act.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Basically, this is a federal tax.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That means that it's everyone in the country.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Everyone has to pay it.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No matter where you live.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Illinois, New York, California, everyone has to pay.

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And how much is this tax, do you know?

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I do not know.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's called a graduated income tax.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That means that people who earn very little pay very little.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
People who earn a lot pay more.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Uh-huh.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So this is something that everyone has to pay, and that's why it's called federal tax, right?

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So in America, federal means national, and state means more local for your own state.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now, she is obviously paying the federal tax that everyone has to pay.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And what about Medicare?

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
All right.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So this is not a tax, per se.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is actually a deduction that goes into kind of a fund.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know, it's a government program.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And when you're older, when you're retired, you will receive benefits from the federal government, from the United States government, to get healthcare.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So Medicare is a kind of healthcare that is paid for by the U.S.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
government.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I see.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So when you're older, you don't really have to pay for your hospital bills then because you worked and contributed to this Medicare fund, then you can go and get treatment.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's right.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Or you pay for part of it, and they pay for part of it.

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it depends on the system.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But yes, it's a way to get healthcare through the government.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And now our next word is interesting because we've heard about Social Security before.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You have the Social Security card, which is basically your ID, or it states also that you are an American.

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But what is the Social Security fund now that you are contributing to?

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, basically, this is another government program that is designed to make sure that people are comfortable when they stop working.

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because when you stop working, you don't have any income anymore.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You need money to live.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And so your whole life, you're paying into this fund, and the government will then give you the money back, some money, to basically live off of when you're retired.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And so how long do you actually have to work in order to be eligible for Social Security?

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I believe you have to be 65 to be eligible for Social Security, but I'm not sure.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's either 60 or 65.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not there yet.

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And actually, another one that's very similar is you have this 401k, which is actually a very interesting name for this tax or fund.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, 401k is more of an investment.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So a 401k is something that you put money into every month or year to access later on when you're retired.

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So again, it's a kind of security for you.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If you work every day, every year for 30 years, 40 years, you want to have some money when you're all done.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And this is basically a retirement savings plan.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So what is the difference between Social Security and the 401k, or are they the same?

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think the difference is where the money goes, I'm not 100%.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But all of these are like, you have to give the government this money, or can I say, hey, I don't want to, don't worry about me, I don't need Social Security, I'm set, I'm saving all on my own, and can I refuse to pay these taxes?

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:43,000
401k, yes, you can refuse, it's not a tax, it's just something that you can, usually this is not a government program, this is something that the company that you work for will set up for you.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But Medicare and Social Security, these are things that you have to pay into.

178
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Because even if you're rich, and you have all this money, you know, there are a lot of people in America that don't have any of this.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And so we consider it something that we do for each other, as much as for ourselves.

180
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Because also, you know, Medicare, Medicaid, these are programs that you can also be eligible for, even if you're 25 years old, or 30 years old, you're poor, you don't have a job.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So these are social programs.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, very good.

183
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's very, very interesting.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You see that, obviously, this is why in movies, you see that people make fun of taxes and how much tax in America there is and how you can escape taxes.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But it's interesting to see how it's made up and why you are giving your money to the government.

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue again.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It was pretty complicated.

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So hopefully, you've understood a little bit more after we've talked about it now.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have some questions about my paycheck.

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You bet, Emily, pull up a chair.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States.

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And there are a few things I don't understand.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
First off, what is this FICA and SUI SDI tax?

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

198
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This number here represents your gross pay.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Then here we have a series of deductions.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
First off are the federal ones.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's your federal income tax.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
All right, I see.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.

207
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's right.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There's the state income tax.

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And then this SUI SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, I don't mind giving them $1.50 for that.

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's right.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Not all states have an income tax.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

217
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I see.

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
All right.

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thanks for your help, Susan.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No problem.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I just never paid much attention.

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
See you later.

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
All right.

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So another interesting thought that came up was, well, where does the money for government spending come from?

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So because you have all these taxes that are for you basically, you have property tax, or maybe does it come from sales tax that maybe the government can make roads and parks and stuff like this?

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, that's the thing.

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Remember earlier we talked about federal and state taxes.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, if it's a state tax like sales tax, you know, in America, I can pay sales tax in California, but maybe in New Mexico there is no sales tax.

234
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So this is a state tax and that means that the state government can use the money for state projects, parks, roads, things like that.

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But then the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, the FICA, this federal tax, that is something that's used for our military, our government.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You know, this pays the paychecks of people in Congress, the president.

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is where all the money to pay them comes from.

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And so basically the state taxes pay for state benefits and programs and the federal taxes pay for these nationwide programs.

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So that's, I think, one of the most interesting things about this topic is that the United States is like 50 small countries that kind of have their own little governments.

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know, they have their own taxes and they have their own rules.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Like in some states you can start driving when you're 16 and others when you're 15.

242
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And so it's like all these little small countries, but at the same time you have this one mega country that has federal taxes and federal insurance and military and all this.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's true.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And, you know, it's an interesting fact about American history that the most conflict in our country has really come down to these two groups.

245
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
One group believes that the federal government, so that's the national government, should have more power than the states.

246
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And another group believes that the states should have more power.

247
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And that is a big problem, you know, this disagreement that we've had in America that goes back to 1776 and the founding fathers.

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And so I don't think it's something that is fixed.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
These things change, you know, sometimes more federal power, sometimes less, but it's a very interesting part of American history.

250
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And also it would be interesting to hear from our users how it works over there, because I know that approximately a rough estimate is that around 30 to 40 percent of Americans' income goes to tax, right?

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
About that, yeah.

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So almost half of your money goes into taxes.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So I wonder how much it is in other people's countries.

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Maybe they have 60 percent of taxes or maybe 10.

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yeah.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So let us know.

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000

258
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We hope to see you guys there.

259
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
All right.

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,000
See you guys.
