00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,480
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,460
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very complicated topic for you.

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,060
That's right.

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:20,940
This is an upper intermediate lesson, a little bit more difficult, and we're talking all about taxes, paychecks, and all the information for when you work in the United States.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,460
That's right.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,000
It confuses me, and I'm American, so take a close listen.

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,239
We're going to listen to this dialogue one time, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's going on.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,039
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,100
I have some questions about my paycheck.

11
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,539
You bet, Emily.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,320
Pull up a chair.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,359
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States, and there are a few things I don't understand.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:56,960
First off, what is this FICA and SUISDI tax, and why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,539
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

16
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,780
This number here represents your gross pay.

17
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,780
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

18
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,500
Then here we have a series of deductions.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,739
First off are the federal ones.

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,680
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,599
It's your federal income tax, and then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

22
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,739
All right, I see.

23
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,819
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.

24
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,079
That's right.

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,060
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

26
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:44,799
There's the state income tax, and then this SUISDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,620
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,500
Yeah, I don't mind giving them $1.50 for that.

29
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:56,379
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

30
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,519
That's right.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,719
Not all states have an income tax.

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,219
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

33
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,459
I see.

34
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:05,480
All right.

35
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,419
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,620
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

37
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,020
Thanks for your help, Susan.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,000
No problem.

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,860
All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,280
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

41
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

42
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,199
I just never paid much attention.

43
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,060
See you later.

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,599
All right, we're back.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,360
So obviously a lot of vocab there, a lot of acronyms as well, like FICA and all that stuff.

46
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,639
We'll take a look at that in a little bit.

47
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,860
First, let's start off with some language on Language Takeaway.

48
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,520
Language Takeaway.

49
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,379
So when you get paid, there's a very important number you want to look at, or a couple of numbers.

50
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,560
These are called deductions.

51
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:56,560
Now, why do deductions make people sad, Marco?

52
00:02:56,979 --> 00:03:00,599
Because a deduction is to take away or reduce.

53
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:10,120
So obviously if your salary is, let's say, $1,000 and you have $500 deductions, then you only get five instead of $1,000.

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,379
All right, so deductions mean what money is being taken away from you, all right?

55
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:19,319
That's the money that's deducted for certain taxes or certain programs.

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,360
It's important to remember that deduct to deduct is the opposite of to add.

57
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,219
It means to take away.

58
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,479
To take away, that's right.

59
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:33,439
So Emily had some questions about her salary, and so she brought her pay stub to Susan to ask her, why are all these deductions?

60
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,400
Why am I not getting all my salary?

61
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,080
That's right.

62
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,819
So pay stubs are very important pieces of paper.

63
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,699
Basically when you go to a store and you buy something, you get a receipt.

64
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,819
Well, when you go to work and you get paid, you get a receipt for your payment.

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,199
That means that it shows you how much money you earn and all of these deductions.

66
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,580
So if you're paid every month, you get a paid stub every month.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,460
If you're paid every two weeks, you get a pay stub every two weeks.

68
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:57,939
Okay.

69
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,500
So it's basically a little receipt that tells you you have been paid and how much you were paid.

70
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:02,979
That's right.

71
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:10,080
All right, so Susan started explaining about her gross salary and her net salary.

72
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,780
All right, and these are the two most important numbers on your pay stub.

73
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,660
On your pay stub, it will say gross pay, not gross like icky gross, but like total.

74
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:33,100
So in total, you earn $1,000 a month, but that's not how much money you have in your bank because the money that you earn is actually a little bit different because of these deductions we mentioned.

75
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,259
So the net pay is the actual amount of money you get to keep.

76
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:38,879
Right.

77
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:50,319
So the company will pay $1,000, but with taxes and all these deductions, the actual money that you get is less, and that's called the net pay.

78
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,699
So it's important when you're looking at these numbers, look at your gross pay.

79
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,459
Is that correct?

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,439
And then afterwards, look at your net pay.

81
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:58,759
Is that what money you actually received?

82
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,519
That's right.

83
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:10,779
All right, so now getting into a little bit of taxes and the type of taxes that we have out there, not considering the taxes for the salary, this is a different one.

84
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:12,399
We have a property tax.

85
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:12,959
That's right.

86
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:21,560
So some places in America tax you on the amount of money you earn at your job, but a lot of others like to collect taxes from different areas.

87
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,180
So property tax is one of those.

88
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:31,180
If you own land, if you own a house or a condo, you will pay a property tax every year.

89
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,860
Every year you have to pay for owning this property.

90
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,459
That's right.

91
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:38,860
Because basically you're paying the state for the land that you have, or the space that you have.

92
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,699
And the bigger your house is, the bigger the land is, the more money you pay.

93
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,939
And you have to pay the same value every year, or does it change over time?

94
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,379
It can change over time.

95
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,519
You hear this sometimes.

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,660
Property taxes are, or property value increases, and so then property tax will probably increase as well.

97
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,379
Okay.

98
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,019
And what about sales tax?

99
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,240
I think this is very straightforward, but how does it work?

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,180
Well, it's straightforward, Marco, but I don't think they have this in many other places in the world.

101
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,379
China, for example, we don't really have a sales tax, so people don't have to worry about it.

102
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,779
But a sales tax is a small tax that you pay every time you buy something.

103
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:16,160
All right.

104
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,639
If I buy a TV and the TV is $100, it's possible that the sales tax is 3%, I pay $103.

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,959
So that's another way that you are taxed, not on how much money you make, but on the purchases that you make.

106
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,620
It makes sense.

107
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:41,519
If I buy a lot of cool things, cars, TVs, I'm paying more money to my state to provide services like schools and roads and things like that.

108
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,000
Uh-huh.

109
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,439
Okay.

110
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,160
So a lot of interesting things here.

111
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:53,860
I think we can move on now to specifically talking about the taxes related to people's salaries or how it works in the United States.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,019
This is, remember that we are talking specifically about the United States here, so let's take a look at that now on Fluency Builder.

113
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,220
Fluency Builder.

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,180
All right, so one of the scary acronyms here, Marco, was FICA.

115
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,240
The FICA.

116
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,779
FICA.

117
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,740
It looks very strange here.

118
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,000
What is this FICA?

119
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,199
Well, this is an acronym.

120
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,639
And remember, acronyms are words that stand for other words.

121
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:24,220
So F, federal, I, insurance, C, contribution and A, act.

122
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,779
So Federal Insurance Contribution Act.

123
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,759
Basically, this is a federal tax.

124
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,220
That means that it's everyone in the country.

125
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:33,500
Everyone has to pay it.

126
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,579
No matter where you live.

127
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,620
Illinois, New York, California, everyone has to pay.

128
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,860
And how much is this tax, do you know?

129
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,860
I do not know.

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
It's called a graduated income tax.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,939
That means that people who earn very little pay very little.

132
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,360
People who earn a lot pay more.

133
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,959
Uh-huh.

134
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,439
Okay.

135
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,319
So this is something that everyone has to pay, and that's why it's called federal tax, right?

136
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:53,899
That's right.

137
00:07:53,899 --> 00:08:00,120
So in America, federal means national, and state means more local for your own state.

138
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,680
Now, she is obviously paying the federal tax that everyone has to pay.

139
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,360
And what about Medicare?

140
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,180
All right.

141
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,000
So this is not a tax, per se.

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,420
This is actually a deduction that goes into kind of a fund.

143
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,040
You know, it's a government program.

144
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:26,220
And when you're older, when you're retired, you will receive benefits from the federal government, from the United States government, to get healthcare.

145
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,800
So Medicare is a kind of healthcare that is paid for by the U.S.

146
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:31,160
government.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:31,879
I see.

148
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:40,100
So when you're older, you don't really have to pay for your hospital bills then because you worked and contributed to this Medicare fund, then you can go and get treatment.

149
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:40,820
That's right.

150
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,820
Or you pay for part of it, and they pay for part of it.

151
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,059
So it depends on the system.

152
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,299
But yes, it's a way to get healthcare through the government.

153
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:48,860
Okay.

154
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,600
And now our next word is interesting because we've heard about Social Security before.

155
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:59,659
You have the Social Security card, which is basically your ID, or it states also that you are an American.

156
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,639
But what is the Social Security fund now that you are contributing to?

157
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:09,879
Well, basically, this is another government program that is designed to make sure that people are comfortable when they stop working.

158
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,379
Because when you stop working, you don't have any income anymore.

159
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:13,960
You need money to live.

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:24,220
And so your whole life, you're paying into this fund, and the government will then give you the money back, some money, to basically live off of when you're retired.

161
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:25,139
Okay.

162
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:31,659
And so how long do you actually have to work in order to be eligible for Social Security?

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,360
I believe you have to be 65 to be eligible for Social Security, but I'm not sure.

164
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,659
It's either 60 or 65.

165
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,960
I'm not there yet.

166
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:39,419
All right.

167
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:48,419
And actually, another one that's very similar is you have this 401k, which is actually a very interesting name for this tax or fund.

168
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,799
Yeah, 401k is more of an investment.

169
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:58,120
So a 401k is something that you put money into every month or year to access later on when you're retired.

170
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,679
So again, it's a kind of security for you.

171
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,679
If you work every day, every year for 30 years, 40 years, you want to have some money when you're all done.

172
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,720
And this is basically a retirement savings plan.

173
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:16,279
So what is the difference between Social Security and the 401k, or are they the same?

174
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,059
I think the difference is where the money goes, I'm not 100%.

175
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:33,840
But all of these are like, you have to give the government this money, or can I say, hey, I don't want to, don't worry about me, I don't need Social Security, I'm set, I'm saving all on my own, and can I refuse to pay these taxes?

176
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:43,679
401k, yes, you can refuse, it's not a tax, it's just something that you can, usually this is not a government program, this is something that the company that you work for will set up for you.

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,080
But Medicare and Social Security, these are things that you have to pay into.

178
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,620
Because even if you're rich, and you have all this money, you know, there are a lot of people in America that don't have any of this.

179
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:57,899
And so we consider it something that we do for each other, as much as for ourselves.

180
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:08,059
Because also, you know, Medicare, Medicaid, these are programs that you can also be eligible for, even if you're 25 years old, or 30 years old, you're poor, you don't have a job.

181
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,019
So these are social programs.

182
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,139
Okay, very good.

183
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,600
It's very, very interesting.

184
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:22,879
You see that, obviously, this is why in movies, you see that people make fun of taxes and how much tax in America there is and how you can escape taxes.

185
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:29,200
But it's interesting to see how it's made up and why you are giving your money to the government.

186
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

187
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,720
So let's listen to today's dialogue again.

188
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,059
It was pretty complicated.

189
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,179
So hopefully, you've understood a little bit more after we've talked about it now.

190
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,080
Hey, Susan, have you got a sec?

191
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,159
I have some questions about my paycheck.

192
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,379
You bet, Emily, pull up a chair.

193
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:52,220
Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States.

194
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,360
And there are a few things I don't understand.

195
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,539
First off, what is this FICA and SUI SDI tax?

196
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,000
And why are there deductions both from Medicare and from my health insurance plan?

197
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,580
Okay, let's start from the top of your pay stub.

198
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,820
This number here represents your gross pay.

199
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,840
Yes, that's easy enough to understand.

200
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,600
Then here we have a series of deductions.

201
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,779
First off are the federal ones.

202
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,720
FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

203
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,379
It's your federal income tax.

204
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:31,620
And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you are unable to work.

205
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:32,799
All right, I see.

206
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,779
So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now.

207
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,139
That's right.

208
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,200
Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

209
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,059
There's the state income tax.

210
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:51,820
And then this SUI SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and or disability fund that our state has set up.

211
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,700
But you can see that it's a pretty small quantity that they take.

212
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,539
Yeah, I don't mind giving them $1.50 for that.

213
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,440
So there are two separate income taxes, one at a state level and one at a federal level.

214
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,559
That's right.

215
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,759
Not all states have an income tax.

216
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,259
Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.

217
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:11,500
I see.

218
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:12,519
All right.

219
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,480
Well, I think everything else I can figure out on my own.

220
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:20,679
The deductions for health insurance and my 401k are pretty self-explanatory.

221
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,080
Thanks for your help, Susan.

222
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:23,039
No problem.

223
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,879
All those deductions do add up and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like.

224
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:30,320
I can understand why you'd want some explanation.

225
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,559
Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,240
I just never paid much attention.

227
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,200
See you later.

228
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:39,759
All right.

229
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:50,080
So another interesting thought that came up was, well, where does the money for government spending come from?

230
00:13:50,080 --> 00:14:00,259
So because you have all these taxes that are for you basically, you have property tax, or maybe does it come from sales tax that maybe the government can make roads and parks and stuff like this?

231
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:01,320
Well, that's the thing.

232
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:04,679
Remember earlier we talked about federal and state taxes.

233
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:12,100
Well, if it's a state tax like sales tax, you know, in America, I can pay sales tax in California, but maybe in New Mexico there is no sales tax.

234
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:21,080
So this is a state tax and that means that the state government can use the money for state projects, parks, roads, things like that.

235
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:29,740
But then the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, the FICA, this federal tax, that is something that's used for our military, our government.

236
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,860
You know, this pays the paychecks of people in Congress, the president.

237
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,379
This is where all the money to pay them comes from.

238
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:43,100
And so basically the state taxes pay for state benefits and programs and the federal taxes pay for these nationwide programs.

239
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:52,500
So that's, I think, one of the most interesting things about this topic is that the United States is like 50 small countries that kind of have their own little governments.

240
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,379
You know, they have their own taxes and they have their own rules.

241
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,139
Like in some states you can start driving when you're 16 and others when you're 15.

242
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:10,779
And so it's like all these little small countries, but at the same time you have this one mega country that has federal taxes and federal insurance and military and all this.

243
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,600
That's true.

244
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:20,120
And, you know, it's an interesting fact about American history that the most conflict in our country has really come down to these two groups.

245
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,600
One group believes that the federal government, so that's the national government, should have more power than the states.

246
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,340
And another group believes that the states should have more power.

247
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:35,299
And that is a big problem, you know, this disagreement that we've had in America that goes back to 1776 and the founding fathers.

248
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,259
And so I don't think it's something that is fixed.

249
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,820
These things change, you know, sometimes more federal power, sometimes less, but it's a very interesting part of American history.

250
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:59,100
And also it would be interesting to hear from our users how it works over there, because I know that approximately a rough estimate is that around 30 to 40 percent of Americans' income goes to tax, right?

251
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,159
About that, yeah.

252
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,419
So almost half of your money goes into taxes.

253
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:05,740
So I wonder how much it is in other people's countries.

254
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,360
Maybe they have 60 percent of taxes or maybe 10.

255
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,080
Yeah.

256
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:10,759
So let us know.

257
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,620

00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,659
We hope to see you guys there.

259
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,120
All right.

260
