00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,939
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,179
Weber.

3
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,779
As a teacher, it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:14,800
Of course.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,500
I'm very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:23,960
Well, Alan is a great student.

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,820
He's a hard worker and very well behaved.

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,600
However, he does struggle a bit with math.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,020
I guess he gets that from me.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,659
I never did well in math when I was a kid.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,799
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,479
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,679
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions.

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,320
It will really help a lot.

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,859
Thanks a lot.

16
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,960
I will definitely do that.

17
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,560
Is there anything else?

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,579
Um, yes.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,320
Here's a notice from our financial department.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,420
Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, yes, I...
