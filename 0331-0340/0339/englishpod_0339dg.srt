00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Weber.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As a teacher, it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Of course.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, Alan is a great student.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He's a hard worker and very well behaved.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
However, he does struggle a bit with math.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I guess he gets that from me.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I never did well in math when I was a kid.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It will really help a lot.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thanks a lot.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I will definitely do that.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is there anything else?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Um, yes.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Here's a notice from our financial department.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, yes, I...
