00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about a very, well, it's a pretty important part of your child's education.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Something that many schools do is they have a conference between the teacher and the parents, so they can talk about how the child is doing.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this is something very common in American schools, and it's important to learn some of the words that you will hear.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's take a listen to our dialogue, and when we come back, we'll be talking about what some of these words and phrases mean.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Weber.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
As a teacher, it's great seeing the kids' parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of course.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, Alan is a great student.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He's a hard worker and very well behaved.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
However, he does struggle a bit with math.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I guess he gets that from me.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I never did well in math when I was a kid.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It will really help a lot.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thanks a lot.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will definitely do that.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Is there anything else?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here's a notice from our financial department.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, yes.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I...

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're back.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So now let's take a look at some language takeaway.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Language takeaway.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
First up in language takeaway, we have the key phrase here, which is parent-teacher conference.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a parent-teacher conference, a parent-teacher conference.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's basically a meeting between the parent of the child and the teacher of the child.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They talk about how well he is doing or she is doing or where she needs or he needs to improve.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is something that can happen maybe twice a year, maybe four times a year.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It depends on the school, but it's just a meeting between the parents or parent of the child and his or her teacher.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So it's very common with schools in order to make sure that the parent knows how the child is doing in school and can improve maybe.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And one of the goals is to provide the parent with insight into how to help the child learn more.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, so insight is kind of like a better understanding of things.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
More clear picture, yeah.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I could say, you know what Marco, I just don't get that woman, Cindy, can you provide some insight into why she made that decision?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So you want some more information or some type of explanation as to why she made that decision.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Exactly.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And so the teacher will then provide this insight by describing what he or she thinks about the student.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And well, the teacher went on to say that Alan is a great student, hard worker, very well behaved.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So he is a hard worker.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That means he is this, it's not an adjective, this is not.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He is a hard worker.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She is a hard worker.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He is very well behaved.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now this is a way to describe him.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He is not naughty.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He is well behaved.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That means he doesn't start fights.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He doesn't talk in class.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He doesn't cheat.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okay, so what would be the opposite?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You say a child or a person is well behaved, what would be the opposite?

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I would say the child who is not well behaved is naughty.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, so you say he is not well behaved or just he is naughty.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's very naughty.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He always starts fights in class.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now the student is having a little bit of problems with math.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So the parent asks what he can do to complement what he is learning in the classroom.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, so to complement.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You might have heard this verb before, but here it means something special.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It means to add to, all right?

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So, okay, the boy, Alan, he's learning a lot in school, but maybe he's not learning enough because his math scores just aren't good enough.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So the father wants to know what can he do in addition to school, you know, what can he do extra to help his boy?

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So that will, it will complement his studies.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So we have to complement someone as to say, oh, you look nice today.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or this, in this situation, this verb we are saying to provide more support or extra help to something.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So I feel really good about accounting, but I want to take an extra math class to complement my accounting studies because I'm just not very confident in my math.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Very good.

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Exactly.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, and towards the end, well, we're talking about how the child's tuition is overdue.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The teacher says the child's tuition is overdue.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What is tuition, Marco?

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, the tuition is the fees that you have to pay for school.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So maybe a private school will have a tuition.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So a high school or an elementary school, but you often hear this in regards to college or university.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So college tuitions in America are very expensive.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And when a tuition is overdue, it means that it hasn't been paid yet.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so the payment is late.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The payment is late.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Now, a lot of things can be overdue.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That means they've passed their due date.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A bill can be overdue.

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So you should have paid your bill already, but you haven't.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So it's overdue.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So a lot of vocab there.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you for coming tonight, Mr.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Weber.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
As a teacher, it's great seeing the kids' parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, Alan is a great student.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He's a hard worker and very well behaved.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
However, he does struggle a bit with math.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I guess he gets that from me.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I never did well in math when I was a kid.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It will really help a lot.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Thanks a lot.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will definitely do that.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is there anything else?

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Um, yes.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Here's a notice from our financial department.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, yes.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I...

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
All right, we're back.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So now we've prepared three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right, the first phrase here on Fluency Builder is to struggle with.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So Alan is a great student, but he does struggle with math.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So to struggle with something means that you are having a hard time.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's difficult for you.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It is difficult.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So when I was a student in elementary school, I struggled with science.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is there anything you struggled with, Marco?

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I struggled with...

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I struggled a little bit with history.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Interesting.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So for Marco, history was hard.

147
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
For me, science was hard.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But you can also use it for your work, right?

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You can say, I'm struggling a little bit at work.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm struggling with my new schedule.

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I have too much to do.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So after the teacher said that Alan is struggling with math, the parent actually said, I guess he gets that from me.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I never did well in math when I was a kid.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So what is the parent saying?

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He gets that from me or she gets that from me.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This means that the child has the same problems the parent has.

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So when the parent was little, he had a hard time with math.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He struggled with math.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And now his child struggles with math.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So it's something that maybe he inherited or he got from his father.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He gets that from me.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So sometimes you will hear that maybe somebody is stubborn and you say, well, you know, I get that from my dad.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm very talkative.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I get that from my mother.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That means my mother is talkative and I have the same characteristic.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So we're basically saying that you kind of genetically inherit the same characteristics.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Exactly.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
All right.

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And the teacher said that, well, in order to improve, Alan should attend tutoring sessions.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Tutoring sessions.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Now, this is important.

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You might have heard the word tutor before.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I have a math tutor, but a tutoring session is actually the time you spend together with your tutor practicing something or studying something.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Right.

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So you don't have a class with your tutor.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You have a tutoring session.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's right.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Class is for a teacher and many students.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But a tutoring session is one on one.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's two people together, a tutor and a student learner.

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So the word tutor can be a noun.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You have a tutor, which is a person that helps you, or you can tutor someone to tutor, which means to teach or to help.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's right.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So in college, I had a tutoring session with a math tutor two times a week.

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That means my math tutor helped me learn math outside of school, after school.

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Very good.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
All right.

191
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So a lot of great stuff there.

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He does struggle a bit with math.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I guess he gets that from me.

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I never did well in math when I was a kid.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What can I do at home to complement what he is learning in the classroom?

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Well, it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math.

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It will really help a lot.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Thanks a lot.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will definitely do that.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Is there anything else?

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes.

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Here's a notice from our financial department.

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Seems your child's tuition is overdue.

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, yes.

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I...

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
All right.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So parent-teacher conferences, a very common thing, a very common thing.

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I think sometimes even a little bit scary for the kid, because your parent is going to go talk to your teacher, and maybe your teacher's not going to say great things about you.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, this is always very nerve-wracking for children, because maybe you didn't tell your mom and dad what you got on your test in science last week, and then your teacher will tell your parents, and your parents will be angry.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So this is the time when the parents can be honest with the teacher, and the teacher can be honest with the parents.

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right, because sometimes teachers will have a file with maybe your test scores, and they will show them to your parents.

214
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So not only what you get on your report cards, but then you actually see the tests, and it could be, like you say, a little nerve-wracking.

215
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I've also heard, though, it can be nerve-wracking for the teacher, because sometimes teachers have to tell parents things that they don't really want to know about their kids.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If the teacher says, hey, your boy, Alan, he's not very good at math, maybe Alan's dad gets angry and says, yo, no, that's not true, he's very good at math.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So it can be hard for everyone, but I think generally they're very positive.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
They really help the students.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, it's interesting, and actually I haven't really seen parent-teacher conferences to be that common outside of the United States.

220
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So maybe if you're a parent, you have attended a parent-teacher conference, or maybe when you were a kid, your parents went to your parent-teacher conference.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And if you don't have parent-teacher conferences in your country, what do you have?

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
How do parents and teachers talk?

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let us know.

224
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

225
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

226
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Bye.

227
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Bye.
