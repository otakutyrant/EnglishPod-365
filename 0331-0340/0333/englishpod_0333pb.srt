00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello everyone and welcome to English Odd.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,779
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,119
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about the human body, right Marco?

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,699
That's right.

5
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:16,460
Today we are going to take a look at very specific vocabulary words related to your body, what's inside your body.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,359
So let's just jump right into this dialogue.

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,620
Let's listen to this anatomy class.

8
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:31,820
Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,159
Today we will review everything we have learned.

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,840
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,579
The brain.

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,920
That's right, the brain.

13
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:45,000
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,039
Then what major organ is in our chest?

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:47,740
The heart.

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,719
Very good.

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,299
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:59,320
Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

19
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,460
Now what about the organs that help us digest food?

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,239
The stomach and intestines.

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,120
Very good.

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,959
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,439
Are we forgetting anything?

24
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,480
Yeah, our kidneys, liver and bladder.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,140
Oh yes, you are right.

26
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,920
Very important organs indeed.

27
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:22,579
So what do these organs do, teacher?

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,659
Well, um, they...

29
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:26,700
Time for a break.

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,939
We can talk about it when you get back.

31
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,280
Alright, we're back so now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,040
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,500
So the first word we have today is anatomy.

34
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,599
We've heard this already.

35
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,519
This is the study of the body, right?

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,359
That's right.

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,840
So maybe in high school you took an anatomy class.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,680
You studied the bodies maybe of animals, for example.

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,319
That's right.

40
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,780
But if we're talking about human beings, we would call it human anatomy.

41
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:05,099
And we would study the things like your organs, your bones, all the things that make up your body.

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,079
That's right.

43
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,659
And that's our next word.

44
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,280
We're talking about our body organs.

45
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:11,740
Now this is important.

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,099
Where are these located, Marco?

47
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,020
Inside or outside?

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,819
Inside.

49
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,800
Inside the body.

50
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,639
So the body has many different organs and we learned all about these in today's dialogue.

51
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:23,719
But an organ is basically a part.

52
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,560
A part of your body.

53
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,520
But it has a special function or many functions.

54
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,460
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,340
So for example, we talked about the heart.

56
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,620
We all know what the heart is and it's one of our main organs that pumps blood through our body.

57
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:36,539
That's right.

58
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,520
And so some of these organs have to do with processing food, some have to do with blood.

59
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,580
But there's also an interesting system that we heard about called the central nervous system.

60
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,340
That's right.

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,759
And this is very closely related to the brain.

62
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:57,020
And so basically the nervous system is in charge of all the things that you feel in your body.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:57,759
That's right.

64
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,159
So you feel through what are called nerves.

65
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:07,400
And the central nervous system is actually a system that connects all these things together and then connects it to the brain.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,280
So think of a system as being comprised of many different parts, not just one nerve.

67
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,939
That's right.

68
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,860
So we're talking about, for example, your skin is part of the nervous system, your eyes, what you see.

69
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,180
And all this gets fed into the brain and it processes it.

70
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:25,039
And that's what basically the nervous system is all about.

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,659
That's right.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,680
And the brain is also important for other things.

73
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,719
We heard about this noun, cognition.

74
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,340
Yeah, the doctor said, yeah, the teacher said that cognition was one of the other things that the brain helped us with.

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,979
So what exactly is cognition?

76
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,360
Cognition is the ability to think.

77
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:43,219
All right.

78
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,159
So humans have cognition.

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,639
That means we have brains and our brains allow us to think and even talk and write music and things like that.

80
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,860
But for example, a rock does not have cognition.

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,460
Right.

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,900
A plant would not have cognition either because they don't have this special organ, the brain, that allows them to think.

83
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:03,580
Right.

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,759
So it's a noun, right?

85
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,460
You say that we have cognition because we have brains.

86
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,020
That's right.

87
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:09,879
You have it.

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:10,620
Okay.

89
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,259
So those are the four words that we're going to take a look at to introduce the lesson.

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,519
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab?

91
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,860
Let's take a look at some of the main organs that we discussed in this dialogue on Language Takeaway Part 2.

92
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:31,259
Okay, class.

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,060
So today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

94
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:36,399
Today we will review everything we have learned.

95
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,100
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

96
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:39,860
The brain.

97
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,500
That's right.

98
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,160
The brain.

99
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:47,259
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

100
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,300
Then what major organ is in our chest?

101
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:49,959
The heart.

102
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,019
Very good.

103
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,500
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.

104
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,600
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

105
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,720
Now, what about the organs that help us digest food?

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,500
The stomach and intestines.

107
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Very good.

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,220
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

109
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,680
Are we forgetting anything?

110
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:16,279
Yeah.

111
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,720
Our kidneys, liver, and bladder.

112
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,720
Oh, yes.

113
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,379
You are right.

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,139
Very important organs indeed.

115
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,819
So, what do these organs do, teacher?

116
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,920
Well, um, they...

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,939
Time for a break.

118
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,800
We can talk about it when you get back.

119
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,800
So, we're moving down the body.

120
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,600
We had the brain and we mentioned the stomach.

121
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,699
We had the brain and then the heart, of course, which pumps blood like you say, Marco.

122
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,060
But the next item, the next organ, is the stomach.

123
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,779
That's right.

124
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,680
So, we get to the stomach and the intestines, which are very closely bound together.

125
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,759
So, what does the stomach do first?

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:04,920
First of all, when you eat food, the food is sent to your stomach where your stomach breaks it down and decides what parts to keep and what parts to save, right?

127
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:05,420
Right.

128
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,459
And the interesting thing is that in our stomachs, we have what we call acid.

129
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,040
Yeah.

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:18,199
So, these acids break down those foods because it all gets mixed together in there and your body has to determine what exactly you've been eating.

131
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,879
Right.

132
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:19,519
Exactly.

133
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:24,639
So, after the stomach breaks things down, it goes through the intestines.

134
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,800
And also, the intestines are very important and they're very long, but they're all wound up inside our stomach.

135
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,379
That's right.

136
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:49,040
They kind of look like a lot of S's because they're all coiled up inside of us and they're indeed quite long, but the intestines are also very, very important because they're actually what the waste or the parts of food that our bodies don't need, so they travel through to get out of our systems.

137
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:49,839
That's right.

138
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,500
So, actually, the intestines will absorb part of the proteins and the vitamins and everything that we need.

139
00:06:55,899 --> 00:07:05,360
And at the same time, they will also act as little tunnels that will transport the waste, the things that we don't need to have inside our body to later be able to digest.

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,660
That's right.

141
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,740
So, the stomach and the intestines, those have to do with the way that we eat, process, and dispose of food.

142
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,060
But now we have the kidneys, okay?

143
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,540
So, people have two kidneys, right?

144
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,600
Yeah, that's right.

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,079
People have two kidneys, and actually, you can continue living with just one kidney, right?

146
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,540
That's right.

147
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,120
They're kind of shaped like a C, almost.

148
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,480
In fact, we have something called a kidney bean in English, which is a red bean, and it looks just like a kidney.

149
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,399
Okay.

150
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,319
And, well, what do the kidneys do?

151
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,459
The kidneys, from what I understand, basically clean your blood.

152
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:57,259
So, there's lots of things in your system, in your body, especially from the things that you eat and maybe the chemicals that you're exposed to, and we need our kidneys, or at least the one kidney, to clean our blood and make sure our blood is what it's supposed to be.

153
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,699
And, in fact, when the kidneys aren't working properly, it's very, very serious, and we call this kidney failure.

154
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,699
So, when you're watching a TV show about doctors, maybe you say, Oh, he's gone into kidney failure.

155
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,100
It's a big deal.

156
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:10,000
Very big problem.

157
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, so this is what our kidneys do.

158
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,959
A very important part of our bodies, obviously.

159
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,800
And, well, as you said, they act as filters, but near the kidneys, we also have the liver.

160
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:21,920
That's right.

161
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,060
Liver is actually, for some people, a delicious food.

162
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,959
Not human liver, but animal liver.

163
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,319
But in humans, we also have this organ, right?

164
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,720
And it's also closely related to people who have drinking problems.

165
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,840
They have bad livers.

166
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,100
And why is that?

167
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,919
I think it has to do a little bit with what the liver does.

168
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,120
It does many different things.

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,139
But alcohol, I think, harms your liver.

170
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:43,899
It makes it weaker.

171
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:50,580
And the liver is important because it helps to generate hormones, but it also helps us process chemicals in our body.

172
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:51,059
Right.

173
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,620
Yeah, so this is really important.

174
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,500
Actually, why the liver is so important is because it does so much.

175
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,519
And, well, we only got one of them, so we can't really live without it, right?

176
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,340
That's right.

177
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,100
So the liver is a very important thing.

178
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,519
And actually, many people now have gone through liver transplants.

179
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,059
That means that their liver stops working, so they receive the liver of another person.

180
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,179
Yeah, so you might hear that as well on TV.

181
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,860
And the last organ that we took a look at here is the bladder, which is also very important.

182
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,320
It goes hand in hand with the kidneys.

183
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,840
It does, it does.

184
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,360
So the bladder, you might hear someone say, I have a bad bladder.

185
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,899
That means that I often have to use the bathroom to go urinate.

186
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:44,440
Now, the bladder is where liquids and also some kinds of chemicals in our bodies that we get from the food that we eat are kept until we dispose of them.

187
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:45,700
Right, right, exactly.

188
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:52,419
So actually, when your bladder is full, because it gets full of liquid or urine, that's when you have to go to the bathroom.

189
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:53,240
That's right.

190
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,799
And so pregnant women often have weaker bladders.

191
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,200
They feel pressure on the bladder, so it hurts and it doesn't hurt.

192
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,980
It pushes down the bladder, the baby does.

193
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,759
So they often have to pee very often, unlike people who are not pregnant.

194
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,620
Okay, very interesting.

195
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:15,620
And actually, some people say that, you know, I have a small bladder, and that's why they go to the bathroom all the time, more often than others.

196
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,360
Now, why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back in a bit to talk a little bit more.

197
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,519
Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,860
Today we will review everything we have learned.

199
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:36,539
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

200
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:37,299
The brain.

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,620
That's right, the brain.

202
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,700
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

203
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,740
Then what major organ is in our chest?

204
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,419
The heart.

205
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,419
Very good.

206
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:53,980
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system, such as blood vessels and veins.

207
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,019
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

208
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,159
Now, what about the organs that help us digest food?

209
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,560
The stomach and intestines.

210
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:04,820
Very good.

211
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:11,620
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food, and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

212
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,139
Are we forgetting anything?

213
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Yeah, our kidneys, liver, and bladder.

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,820
Oh yes, you are right.

215
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,659
Very important organs indeed.

216
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,299
So, what do these organs do, teacher?

217
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,399
Well, um, they...

218
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,399
Time for a break!

219
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,340
We can talk about it when you get back.

220
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:39,480
Alright, so you mentioned that actually some people get liver transplants, so out of all these organs we could also have a kidney transplant, right?

221
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,799
You can donate your kidneys.

222
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,279
You can, you can.

223
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,360
So, obviously you can't have any kidney, you actually have to have a match.

224
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,340
You know, someone who is the right type.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,879
But often times they do perform these surgeries with a kidney transplant or a liver transplant.

226
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:56,179
Now, what about a heart transplant?

227
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:01,320
I believe they've done tests of heart transplants and they've done a few successful ones.

228
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,840
Sometimes they use pieces of cow or pig hearts.

229
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:12,580
Because they have very similar genetic makeups to human beings, so they can use little pieces like valves, but I really don't know.

230
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,519
I don't think they're as common as liver or kidney.

231
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:31,639
That's right, and actually these organs, we don't really pay too much attention to them, but they're so very delicate and they do so many things that actually once you only begin having some problems with them, that's when you realize how important they are.

232
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,500
That's right.

233
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:46,960
So, it's really important to understand a little bit about how they work and also how to take care of them because obviously if you're having liver problems, you should stop drinking so much that there are some things that you can do to help protect yourself.

234
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,940
And one that we didn't mention is actually the biggest organ that they talk about is the skin.

235
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,580
The skin is a big organ.

236
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,059
Also, the lungs we didn't mention.

237
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,820
Yes, the lungs.

238
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:01,519
The lungs help us breathe, but yeah, the skin is one of the largest parts of our body.

239
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,100
Yeah, I didn't really know that.

240
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,840
I didn't realize that, well, I wasn't very good at anatomy or biology.

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:15,580
I wasn't really into it much, but I didn't realize that the skin is actually an organ just like the heart, the lungs, everything.

242
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:16,779
Interesting.

243
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,299
I hadn't thought about that.

244
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,480
It's maybe because I feel so comfortable in it.

245
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,799
I just get to see it every day.

246
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,779
Yeah, and it's alive.

247
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
It actually breathes.

248
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,379
We're changing skin all the time, so it's very interesting.

249
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:36,200
So, a very medical-related topic, but very interesting as well because we didn't touch so many other parts of the body.

250
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,299
For example, bones.

251
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,919
There are so many names of the different bones.

252
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,940
That's right, and your tongue and your teeth and your eyes, all these different pieces and parts.

253
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,039
Definitely more stuff that we could talk about next time, but for now, we hope that you've learned something.

254
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,000
If you have questions or comments, as always, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and let us know.

255
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:54,559
All right, guys.

256
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:54,960
We'll see you there.

257
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,259
Bye.
