00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to English Odd.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about the human body, right Marco?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we are going to take a look at very specific vocabulary words related to your body, what's inside your body.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's just jump right into this dialogue.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's listen to this anatomy class.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Today we will review everything we have learned.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The brain.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right, the brain.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then what major organ is in our chest?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The heart.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Very good.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Now what about the organs that help us digest food?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The stomach and intestines.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Very good.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Are we forgetting anything?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yeah, our kidneys, liver and bladder.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh yes, you are right.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Very important organs indeed.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So what do these organs do, teacher?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, um, they...

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Time for a break.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We can talk about it when you get back.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Alright, we're back so now let's take a look at some vocab on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So the first word we have today is anatomy.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We've heard this already.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is the study of the body, right?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So maybe in high school you took an anatomy class.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You studied the bodies maybe of animals, for example.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But if we're talking about human beings, we would call it human anatomy.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And we would study the things like your organs, your bones, all the things that make up your body.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And that's our next word.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're talking about our body organs.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Now this is important.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Where are these located, Marco?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Inside or outside?

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Inside.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Inside the body.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So the body has many different organs and we learned all about these in today's dialogue.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But an organ is basically a part.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A part of your body.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But it has a special function or many functions.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So for example, we talked about the heart.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We all know what the heart is and it's one of our main organs that pumps blood through our body.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And so some of these organs have to do with processing food, some have to do with blood.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But there's also an interesting system that we heard about called the central nervous system.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And this is very closely related to the brain.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And so basically the nervous system is in charge of all the things that you feel in your body.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So you feel through what are called nerves.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And the central nervous system is actually a system that connects all these things together and then connects it to the brain.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So think of a system as being comprised of many different parts, not just one nerve.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So we're talking about, for example, your skin is part of the nervous system, your eyes, what you see.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And all this gets fed into the brain and it processes it.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And that's what basically the nervous system is all about.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the brain is also important for other things.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We heard about this noun, cognition.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, the doctor said, yeah, the teacher said that cognition was one of the other things that the brain helped us with.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So what exactly is cognition?

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Cognition is the ability to think.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All right.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So humans have cognition.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That means we have brains and our brains allow us to think and even talk and write music and things like that.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But for example, a rock does not have cognition.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
A plant would not have cognition either because they don't have this special organ, the brain, that allows them to think.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Right.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So it's a noun, right?

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You say that we have cognition because we have brains.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have it.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So those are the four words that we're going to take a look at to introduce the lesson.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why don't we move on now to more specific vocab?

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's take a look at some of the main organs that we discussed in this dialogue on Language Takeaway Part 2.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, class.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Today we will review everything we have learned.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The brain.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The brain.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then what major organ is in our chest?

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The heart.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Very good.

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now, what about the organs that help us digest food?

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The stomach and intestines.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Very good.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are we forgetting anything?

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Our kidneys, liver, and bladder.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh, yes.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You are right.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Very important organs indeed.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So, what do these organs do, teacher?

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, um, they...

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Time for a break.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We can talk about it when you get back.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So, we're moving down the body.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We had the brain and we mentioned the stomach.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We had the brain and then the heart, of course, which pumps blood like you say, Marco.

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But the next item, the next organ, is the stomach.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, we get to the stomach and the intestines, which are very closely bound together.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, what does the stomach do first?

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
First of all, when you eat food, the food is sent to your stomach where your stomach breaks it down and decides what parts to keep and what parts to save, right?

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And the interesting thing is that in our stomachs, we have what we call acid.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, these acids break down those foods because it all gets mixed together in there and your body has to determine what exactly you've been eating.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Right.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Exactly.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So, after the stomach breaks things down, it goes through the intestines.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And also, the intestines are very important and they're very long, but they're all wound up inside our stomach.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's right.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They kind of look like a lot of S's because they're all coiled up inside of us and they're indeed quite long, but the intestines are also very, very important because they're actually what the waste or the parts of food that our bodies don't need, so they travel through to get out of our systems.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's right.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, actually, the intestines will absorb part of the proteins and the vitamins and everything that we need.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And at the same time, they will also act as little tunnels that will transport the waste, the things that we don't need to have inside our body to later be able to digest.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's right.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, the stomach and the intestines, those have to do with the way that we eat, process, and dispose of food.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But now we have the kidneys, okay?

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So, people have two kidneys, right?

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, that's right.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
People have two kidneys, and actually, you can continue living with just one kidney, right?

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They're kind of shaped like a C, almost.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In fact, we have something called a kidney bean in English, which is a red bean, and it looks just like a kidney.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Okay.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And, well, what do the kidneys do?

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The kidneys, from what I understand, basically clean your blood.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, there's lots of things in your system, in your body, especially from the things that you eat and maybe the chemicals that you're exposed to, and we need our kidneys, or at least the one kidney, to clean our blood and make sure our blood is what it's supposed to be.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And, in fact, when the kidneys aren't working properly, it's very, very serious, and we call this kidney failure.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, when you're watching a TV show about doctors, maybe you say, Oh, he's gone into kidney failure.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a big deal.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Very big problem.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, so this is what our kidneys do.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
A very important part of our bodies, obviously.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And, well, as you said, they act as filters, but near the kidneys, we also have the liver.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Liver is actually, for some people, a delicious food.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Not human liver, but animal liver.

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But in humans, we also have this organ, right?

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And it's also closely related to people who have drinking problems.

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They have bad livers.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And why is that?

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think it has to do a little bit with what the liver does.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It does many different things.

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But alcohol, I think, harms your liver.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It makes it weaker.

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And the liver is important because it helps to generate hormones, but it also helps us process chemicals in our body.

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Right.

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, so this is really important.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Actually, why the liver is so important is because it does so much.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And, well, we only got one of them, so we can't really live without it, right?

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's right.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So the liver is a very important thing.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And actually, many people now have gone through liver transplants.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That means that their liver stops working, so they receive the liver of another person.

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, so you might hear that as well on TV.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And the last organ that we took a look at here is the bladder, which is also very important.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It goes hand in hand with the kidneys.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It does, it does.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So the bladder, you might hear someone say, I have a bad bladder.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That means that I often have to use the bathroom to go urinate.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now, the bladder is where liquids and also some kinds of chemicals in our bodies that we get from the food that we eat are kept until we dispose of them.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Right, right, exactly.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So actually, when your bladder is full, because it gets full of liquid or urine, that's when you have to go to the bathroom.

189
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's right.

190
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And so pregnant women often have weaker bladders.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
They feel pressure on the bladder, so it hurts and it doesn't hurt.

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It pushes down the bladder, the baby does.

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So they often have to pee very often, unlike people who are not pregnant.

194
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, very interesting.

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And actually, some people say that, you know, I have a small bladder, and that's why they go to the bathroom all the time, more often than others.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Now, why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back in a bit to talk a little bit more.

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Today we will review everything we have learned.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The brain.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right, the brain.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Then what major organ is in our chest?

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The heart.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Very good.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system, such as blood vessels and veins.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Now, let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now, what about the organs that help us digest food?

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The stomach and intestines.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Very good.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food, and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Are we forgetting anything?

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, our kidneys, liver, and bladder.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh yes, you are right.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Very important organs indeed.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So, what do these organs do, teacher?

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, um, they...

218
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Time for a break!

219
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We can talk about it when you get back.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Alright, so you mentioned that actually some people get liver transplants, so out of all these organs we could also have a kidney transplant, right?

221
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You can donate your kidneys.

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can, you can.

223
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So, obviously you can't have any kidney, you actually have to have a match.

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You know, someone who is the right type.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But often times they do perform these surgeries with a kidney transplant or a liver transplant.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Now, what about a heart transplant?

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I believe they've done tests of heart transplants and they've done a few successful ones.

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sometimes they use pieces of cow or pig hearts.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because they have very similar genetic makeups to human beings, so they can use little pieces like valves, but I really don't know.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't think they're as common as liver or kidney.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's right, and actually these organs, we don't really pay too much attention to them, but they're so very delicate and they do so many things that actually once you only begin having some problems with them, that's when you realize how important they are.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's right.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So, it's really important to understand a little bit about how they work and also how to take care of them because obviously if you're having liver problems, you should stop drinking so much that there are some things that you can do to help protect yourself.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And one that we didn't mention is actually the biggest organ that they talk about is the skin.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The skin is a big organ.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Also, the lungs we didn't mention.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yes, the lungs.

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The lungs help us breathe, but yeah, the skin is one of the largest parts of our body.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, I didn't really know that.

240
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't realize that, well, I wasn't very good at anatomy or biology.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I wasn't really into it much, but I didn't realize that the skin is actually an organ just like the heart, the lungs, everything.

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Interesting.

243
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I hadn't thought about that.

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's maybe because I feel so comfortable in it.

245
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I just get to see it every day.

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, and it's alive.

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It actually breathes.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We're changing skin all the time, so it's very interesting.

249
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, a very medical-related topic, but very interesting as well because we didn't touch so many other parts of the body.

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
For example, bones.

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There are so many names of the different bones.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right, and your tongue and your teeth and your eyes, all these different pieces and parts.

253
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Definitely more stuff that we could talk about next time, but for now, we hope that you've learned something.

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If you have questions or comments, as always, you can come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and let us know.

255
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
All right, guys.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We'll see you there.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Bye.
