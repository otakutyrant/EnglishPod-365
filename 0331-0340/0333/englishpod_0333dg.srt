EnglishPod.com Okay class, so today we're going to continue with our anatomy class.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we will review everything we have learned.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The brain!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right, the brain.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then what major organ is in our chest?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The heart!

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Very good.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It pumps blood throughout the body using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now what about the organs that help us digest food?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The stomach and intestines.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Very good.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process the food and then expel the waste.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Are we forgetting anything?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, our kidneys, liver and bladder.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh yes, you are right.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Very important organs indeed.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So what do these organs do, teacher?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, um, they...

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Time for a break!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We can talk about it when you get back.
