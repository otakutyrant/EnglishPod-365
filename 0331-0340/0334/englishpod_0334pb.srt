00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,819
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:07,620
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking a little bit about Smalltalk.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,460
That's right, we are getting towards the end of our series.

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:17,480
Actually, this is the last podcast that we will have all about Smalltalk, and we're just going to be following Mr.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:25,519
Campbell and Michelle and Melissa, and they're just going to talk very briefly about the weather, about traveling, very casual things.

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:30,399
That's right, so let's take a listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's going on.

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,020
Hi ladies, thanks for picking me up.

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,659
It's awful weather out there.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,399
Absolutely.

11
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:47,299
It's been raining for hours.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
How are you, Melissa?

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:49,399
Are you okay?

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm great thanks, Mr.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,320
Campbell.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Do you have any business trips planned soon, Mr.

17
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:54,219
Campbell?

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,020
Of course, I'm always traveling.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,460
I'll leave for London next Monday, and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,039
It's going to be a busy month.

21
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,200
How about you, Michelle?

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,459
Do you have any vacation plans?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,459
Yes, Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the Spring Festival, and hopefully next year we will visit London.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,060
I hear it's a wonderful city.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,420
I couldn't agree more.

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,140
London is really fantastic.

27
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,239
It's my favorite city.

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,659
I'm sure you'll have a great time.

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,659
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,400
Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,620
Alright, we don't have that much today in Language Takeaway, but we do have a couple of really important words and phrases.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,120
The first one comes from the very first line.

33
00:01:38,379 --> 00:01:38,480
Mr.

34
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:41,659
Campbell says, Hi ladies, thanks for picking me up.

35
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,239
That's right.

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,579
Now, this phrasal verb, to pick someone up, means to get them, right?

37
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:49,959
Yeah, to gather them, to collect them.

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:02:00,540
You can do this with a car, like, I will pick you up at the airport, but you can also do it in person by just walking to a place and meeting somebody, and then taking them somewhere else.

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,819
That's the important part, you take them somewhere else.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,439
So maybe if you go pick your kids up from school, you just walk there, you get them, and you walk back home.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:17,120
That's right, and so the key here is that you remember that the verb goes first, I will pick, and then you have the person, I will pick you up.

42
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:18,439
I will pick them up.

43
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,159
He will pick us up.

44
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,960
That's right, so the subject goes between pick and up.

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,500
That's right.

46
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,860
Alright, so we're going to pick someone up.

47
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:27,780
And then Mr.

48
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,379
Campbell comments on the weather.

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,199
He says, It's awful weather out there.

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,300
It's awful.

51
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,039
Alright, so awful, you listen to the tone, you automatically think that this is probably a bad thing.

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,620
And you're right, it is a bad thing, but what's another way to say awful?

53
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,759
It's terrible, it's bad, it's horrible.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,280
So awful is a way to say something's really bad, and we use it very often with the weather.

55
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:52,580
This weather is awful.

56
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,180
But we can also use it about other things, like food for example.

57
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:02,240
So if you have something to eat and it doesn't taste good, you can say, This is awful, what is this?

58
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,819
Or, what's that awful smell?

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,780
Oh, Marco took his shoes off.

60
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,439
Right, an awful smell.

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,479
Alright, and well, Mr.

62
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,199
Campbell went on to tell them that he's taking another trip soon, but a specific kind of trip.

63
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,460
Alright, so you know that there are many different kinds of trips, but the one that he's taking is a business trip.

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,400
So normally we could just say, I'm going on a trip next year.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,560
But here we specify, we say it's a business trip, so what are we doing on this trip, Marco?

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,419
That's right, so we're basically working.

67
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,539
We're going because our company needs us to go to a meeting or to do some work abroad.

68
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:49,979
Alright, so you know on a business trip that you'll be doing work things, you'll be having meetings, you will not be going to Disney World, you will not be meeting with friends and going to movies, probably.

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,219
Right, exactly.

70
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,199
So it's very different from a vacation.

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,360
A vacation you go with the objective of going to these fun places.

72
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,000
So can I say, I'm going on a business vacation?

73
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,860
No, you're either going on vacation or you're taking a business trip.

74
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,319
Alright, business trip.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,159
So now let's take a break and let's review our dialogue.

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
Hi, ladies.

77
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,220
Thanks for picking me up.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,860
It's awful weather out there.

79
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,660
Absolutely.

80
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,480
It's been raining for hours.

81
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,860
How are you, Melissa?

82
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:27,620
Are you okay?

83
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm great, thanks, Mr.

84
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:29,540
Campbell.

85
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,100
Do you have any business trips planned soon, Mr.

86
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Campbell?

87
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:34,240
Of course, I'm always traveling.

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,680
I'll leave for London next Monday and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,259
It's going to be a busy month.

90
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,459
How about you, Michelle?

91
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,680
Do you have any vacation plans?

92
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,100
Yes, Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the Spring Festival.

93
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,660
And hopefully next year we will visit London.

94
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,279
I hear it's a wonderful city.

95
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,620
I couldn't agree more.

96
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,360
London is really fantastic.

97
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,439
It's my favorite city.

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,839
I'm sure you'll have a great time.

99
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,459
Alright, so now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,399
Fluency Builder.

101
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,160
Alright, now we have a great phrase for everybody here in Fluency Builder.

102
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:13,920
Melissa is talking to Mr.

103
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,959
Campbell and he asks her how she is.

104
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,860
Are you okay?

105
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,879
And she says, I'm great, thanks.

106
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,220
Now, Marco, why would we use this phrase instead of I'm fine, thank you?

107
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,100
Well, it's basically the same thing.

108
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,420
It's just another way of answering this common question.

109
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,100
How are you?

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,819
You can say I'm fine, thank you.

111
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm well.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,660
But this is just another way of saying I'm okay.

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,540
Alright, but I think it's important too to remember that this is also very casual, like the rest of the conversation, and pretty enthusiastic.

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,420
She's great.

115
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,480
So it's important to remember that I'm fine, thanks is standard.

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,000
It's very normal, but I'm great is a nice way to change it and do something different.

117
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:54,740
That's right.

118
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:01,779
Okay, and now we wanted to ask if we have any plans, but we wanted to know if we have any vacation plans.

119
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,879
And the interesting thing about this question was that Mr.

120
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,300
Campbell said, any vacation plans?

121
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,060
So that's the whole sentence.

122
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,519
Well, first he says, how about you, Michelle?

123
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,180
Any vacation plans?

124
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,740
So what we think here is that maybe it's wrong.

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Do you have any vacation plans is something that we'd want to hear, right?

126
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,019
Right.

127
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,579
But here we don't actually need to say, do you have any vacation plans?

128
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:27,019
Because it's pretty clear who we're talking to.

129
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,339
We're talking to Michelle, right?

130
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,180
Right.

131
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:38,420
And we're talking about traveling and we're talking about plans, so it's overstated that we don't really need to say, do you have any vacation plans?

132
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,339
We're already talking about the subject.

133
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,540
Now this is a great way to transition.

134
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,500
One person is talking about himself or herself, and then you want to talk about the other person.

135
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,500
So you say, what about you?

136
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,519
Any vacation plans or any dinner plans or any ideas?

137
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,639
Exactly.

138
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:01,879
So it's a great way to, like you say, transition from one idea or from one person to another.

139
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:10,279
Now to the next phrase, a very common one, and specifically when you are not really sure about something, but somebody told you.

140
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,100
Specifically in this case, Michelle says, I hear it's a wonderful city when talking about London.

141
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,839
So what does she mean by, I hear it's a wonderful city?

142
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:29,639
Well basically Michelle is saying she's never been to London, but she's read or she's heard from friends or from a TV show that London's a wonderful city.

143
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,620
So she can't say, it is a wonderful city, because she's never been there.

144
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:39,500
But she can say, listen, I have heard this from other people or from magazines.

145
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,980
So it's not even clear where she heard it, but that's not really important.

146
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:53,759
So basically the idea is that we don't know personally, but we have friends that told us or we have read in a magazine or a TV show, we've seen it, that it's great.

147
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,959
So you can use it with many things, like a restaurant.

148
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:56,939
That's right.

149
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:58,339
I hear the food is delicious.

150
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,259
Or I could say, hey Marco, I'm going to Hong Kong Disneyland next year.

151
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,699
Right, and I can say, oh I hear that it's a very fun place.

152
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,079
So Marco, you've never been there, right?

153
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,019
No, I've never been there.

154
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,459
Alright, and to finish off, Mr.

155
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:18,300
Campbell agrees completely about London being such a wonderful city and he says, I couldn't agree more.

156
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:20,300
I couldn't agree more.

157
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,139
So he agrees, we understand that.

158
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,160
But I couldn't agree more is like saying, I really agree.

159
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,800
Right, like you are completely right.

160
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,220
Yeah, so this is a way to exaggerate.

161
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,600
You know, you want to say, I agree.

162
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,820
Eh, it's a little boring.

163
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,360
So you say, I couldn't agree more.

164
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,299
I'm agreeing the most I can.

165
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,179
That's right.

166
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,360
And then we can also use the opposite, which would be if you disagree with someone.

167
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,299
I couldn't disagree more.

168
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,679
So you just change that one word.

169
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,179
I couldn't disagree more.

170
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,320
So maybe I don't like London, maybe it's too rainy or too dark for me.

171
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,139
So I say, I couldn't disagree more.

172
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,259
I think London is terrible.

173
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,840
Maybe not the right thing to say in a small talk situation, but we can talk about that in a minute.

174
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:06,399
Exactly.

175
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,879
Alright, so let's review everything one last time.

176
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,580
Hi ladies, thanks for picking me up.

177
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,080
It's awful weather out there.

178
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,840
Absolutely.

179
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,820
It's been raining for hours.

180
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,179
How are you Melissa?

181
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:27,960
Are you okay?

182
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,539
I'm great thanks Mr.

183
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:29,860
Campbell.

184
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,419
Do you have any business trips planned soon Mr.

185
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Campbell?

186
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,559
Of course, I'm always traveling.

187
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll leave for London next Monday and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

188
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,580
It's going to be a busy month.

189
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:40,759
How about you Michelle?

190
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,019
Do you have any vacation plans?

191
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes, Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the Spring Festival and hopefully next year we will visit London.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,620
I hear it's a wonderful city.

193
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:52,960
I couldn't agree more.

194
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,679
London is really fantastic.

195
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,779
It's my favorite city.

196
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,159
I'm sure you'll have a great time.

197
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,279
Alright, so this is our last podcast all about small talk and well I hope it's been useful.

198
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:15,240
We've gotten some great feedback about the different topics and small conversations you can have with a stranger, a co-worker, a friend, to kind of not have that awkward silence.

199
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,179
That's right.

200
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,120
We've gone over a lot of different situations.

201
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:28,360
We've had situations with strangers, situations with work friends, but I think what's really important is that in all these situations we're very polite.

202
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,779
We say nice things.

203
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:35,360
There are these transitions like I hear or I couldn't agree more.

204
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,700
These are wonderful ways of really being nice to the person you're talking to.

205
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,720
That's right and we're going to come out with a new series soon so we would really like your feedback.

206
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:52,519
