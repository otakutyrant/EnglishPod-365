EnglishPod.com Hi ladies, thanks for picking me up.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,919
It's awful weather out there.

3
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:14,560
Absolutely.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,519
It's been raining for hours.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,839
How are you, Melissa?

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,600
Are you okay?

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,199
I'm great, thanks Mr.

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:20,519
Campbell.

9
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,079
Do you have any business trips planned soon, Mr.

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:23,399
Campbell?

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,219
Of course, I'm always traveling.

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,679
I'll leave for London next Monday and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,219
It's going to be a busy month.

14
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,399
How about you, Michelle?

15
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,640
Do you have any vacation plans?

16
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:40,640
Yes, Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the Spring Festival and hopefully next year we will visit London.

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,240
I hear it's a wonderful city.

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,579
I couldn't agree more.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,340
London is really fantastic.

20
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,420
It's my favorite city.

21
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:47,780
I'm sure you'll have a great time.
