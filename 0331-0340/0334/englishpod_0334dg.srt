EnglishPod.com Hi ladies, thanks for picking me up.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's awful weather out there.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Absolutely.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been raining for hours.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
How are you, Melissa?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Are you okay?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm great, thanks Mr.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Campbell.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you have any business trips planned soon, Mr.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Campbell?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Of course, I'm always traveling.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll leave for London next Monday and then I'll fly to Boston from there.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's going to be a busy month.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How about you, Michelle?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Do you have any vacation plans?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, Mike and I will travel to Beijing to see Mike's parents for the Spring Festival and hopefully next year we will visit London.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I hear it's a wonderful city.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I couldn't agree more.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
London is really fantastic.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's my favorite city.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm sure you'll have a great time.
