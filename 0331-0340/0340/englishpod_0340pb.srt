00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:02,859
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,600
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:09,820
My name is Catherine and it's the start of a very new year so we have some interesting vocabulary for you today about the new year.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,460
That's right.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,500
So we are starting a new year.

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,339
Why don't we just jump right into this dialogue.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,440
Let's see what's going on and we'll be back in a bit.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,300
It's almost midnight.

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,539
We're about to start a brand new year.

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:28,399
I know.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,480
It's so exciting.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,420
A new year is always like a clean slate.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,179
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,280
Do you have a new year's resolution?

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,899
I was thinking about it but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

16
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:44,479
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,500
Yeah, I know what you mean.

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,780
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

19
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,159
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

20
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,359
That seems reasonable.

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,880
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:00:59,700
Sure.

23
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,600
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

24
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,379
Well, we can't break tradition.

25
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,459
It's bad luck.

26
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,819
Alright, so we've prepared a couple of different words for you on language takeaway.

27
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,959
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,959
Alright, the first word we have is actually a phrase.

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,159
We have this phrase brand new.

30
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,280
Something is a brand new thing.

31
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:26,879
That's right.

32
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,980
We said that we are starting a brand new year and that's just another way of saying completely new.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,760
So I want a brand new bicycle.

34
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,060
It means I want a new bicycle from the store, not one from the garage.

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,739
That's right.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,359
So it's something completely new, never been used.

37
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,340
So we're starting a brand new year and we're saying it's exciting because it's a great opportunity like having a clean slate.

38
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,560
So a clean slate.

39
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:59,879
Now this is an interesting phrase because you might not know what a slate is, but basically it means that you start from the very beginning.

40
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,280
So there's no history.

41
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,640
There's nothing that you have to worry about.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
You start completely new.

43
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,400
That's a clean slate.

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,139
That's right.

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,680
So just imagine you're in class and you have the whiteboard or the chalkboard and you just erase everything and then you start again.

46
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,759
That's kind of what it means to have a clean slate, a new start.

47
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,580
Exactly.

48
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,300
And so we have a clean slate.

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,139
We need to talk about what we will do with the clean slate.

50
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,860
And so one person asks the other, do you have any new year's resolutions?

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,159
That's right.

52
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:37,419
So this is one of the most popular things during the new years is people make a new year's resolution.

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,039
So a resolution is something that you have decided you will do.

54
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,199
I have many resolutions.

55
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,479
I will learn to play the piano this year.

56
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,280
So in the new year, I will do this thing.

57
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,020
That's right.

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,060
So it's basically like a promise, something that you promise yourself that you will do in the new year.

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,439
So as you say, maybe start playing the piano.

60
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,319
That's right.

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,400
So we call that a resolution or if we want to be specific, we call it a new year's resolution.

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,479
Now, at the very end of the dialogue, we heard another phrase.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
This is quite strange.

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,120
They want to kiss at midnight.

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,139
And the one person says, well, we can't break tradition.

66
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,939
That's right.

67
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,939
To break a tradition or to break tradition.

68
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,020
And that basically means to not do something that we usually do.

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,719
All right.

70
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,960
So you can follow tradition.

71
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,539
That means that you do the same thing maybe every year.

72
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,099
But if you break tradition, that means you don't do what you are expected to do.

73
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,500
So remember, that verb is to break.

74
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,300
Break tradition.

75
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,099
That's right.

76
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:39,840
All right.

77
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,919
So let's review this vocab.

78
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,479
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

79
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,419
It's almost midnight.

80
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,639
We're about to start a brand new year.

81
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,500
I know.

82
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,580
It's so exciting.

83
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,520
A new year is always like a clean slate.

84
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:01,300
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

85
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,379
Do you have a new year's resolution?

86
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:07,000
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

87
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,580
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

88
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,599
Yeah, I know what you mean.

89
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,879
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

90
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:21,279
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

91
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,459
That seems reasonable.

92
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,000
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

93
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:25,819
Sure.

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,699
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

95
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,500
Well, we can't break tradition.

96
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:31,560
It's bad luck.

97
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,279
All right.

98
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,459
So let's take a look at those phrases now on Fluency Builder.

99
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,079
So there's a phrase in here that I use all the time.

100
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,319
We heard about this resolution to go to the gym more often.

101
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,660
And the person said, you know, I never really go to the gym.

102
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,040
And the other said, you know, I know what you mean.

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,240
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,420
She says, yeah, I know what you mean.

105
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:06,220
And so basically we use this when you agree with the person, you understand what they are saying.

106
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,319
Yeah, it's almost like saying I had the same experience.

107
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,019
So maybe I also belong to a gym and I never go to that gym, just like you.

108
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,699
So it means I know what you mean.

109
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,939
I have the same problem.

110
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:18,839
That's right.

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,220
So you can just agree with someone, completely agree with someone by saying, yeah, I know what you mean or I know what you mean.

112
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,459
I know what you mean.

113
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:28,240
All right.

114
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,819
So, well, this year we want to keep things a little bit more simple.

115
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:37,079
And we said, well, maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time.

116
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:37,720
All right.

117
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,500
So think about this.

118
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,420
To get together with friends.

119
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,459
Lots of words there.

120
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:43,699
But you can see friends.

121
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,920
But to get together means to be social with, to hang out with, to do things together.

122
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,139
But it's not very specific.

123
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,620
It's a nice way to say just to be with your friends.

124
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,319
That's right.

125
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,500
So maybe you are going with your friends out, maybe shopping, maybe to the movies.

126
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:03,620
So you say, yeah, I'm going to get together with my friends later on this afternoon.

127
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:04,639
All right.

128
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,980
So we can get together with friends as a resolution.

129
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,060
That's something we want to do in the near future.

130
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,699
But for now, we're going to get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

131
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:17,160
That's the New Year's plan.

132
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,240
That's right.

133
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,139
So it may seem strange.

134
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,240
It's not actually a phrasal verb or a colloquial phrase.

135
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,459
There is actually a ball that goes down as the countdown begins to midnight.

136
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:35,220
And once it completely disappears, then, you know, you celebrate the New Year.

137
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,100
So you actually see this big round ball coming down in Times Square.

138
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,600
Yeah.

139
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,939
It's a way to count down to the New Year.

140
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,420
So people often say ten, nine, eight, seven.

141
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,800
So the countdown and the ball will drop.

142
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,199
And that means it's the New Year.

143
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,220
So this is something that we refer to.

144
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:55,920
It's something we talk about when we want to discuss the New Year.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,980
So we'll watch the ball drop together.

146
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,079
It's an event.

147
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,120
That's right.

148
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:00,860
OK.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,279
So a lot of great stuff there.

150
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,300
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time.

151
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,100
It's almost midnight.

152
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,319
We're about to start a brand new year.

153
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:17,279
I know it's so exciting.

154
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,980
A new year is always like a clean slate, a fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

155
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,079
Do you have a New Year's resolution?

156
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,699
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolutions.

157
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:32,279
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

158
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:34,300
Yeah, I know what you mean.

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,560
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

160
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:42,920
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

161
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,160
That seems reasonable.

162
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,680
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

163
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,519
Sure.

164
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,379
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

165
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,199
Well, we can't break tradition.

166
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,259
It's bad luck.

167
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,699
All right.

168
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:04,160
So talking about New Year's, everyone makes New Year's resolutions and people get together to watch the ball drop in Times Square.

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,639
Now, this is more of an American thing.

170
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,920
Have you ever experienced anything different from New Year's, some other type of tradition?

171
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,560
Because also here they kiss at midnight.

172
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,579
That's right.

173
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:18,279
Well, that's a pretty standard American tradition.

174
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,980
People will get together and they'll have the TV on.

175
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:28,060
They'll have a party or they'll be with friends and they will maybe watch some fireworks or watch the TV as the ball drops.

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:28,860
So I've done both.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,199
I've gone out because sometimes you go outside.

178
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:31,920
It's very cold.

179
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:39,860
But you go to a bridge or a park or somewhere public or the city government or the state will have some kind of special fireworks display.

180
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,059
So then everyone will watch the fireworks or watch a big TV screen.

181
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,360
And then when it's midnight, when it's the new year, then everyone will kiss.

182
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,120
So everyone will kiss maybe.

183
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,820
I mean, is it like just between couples or whoever is available, you kiss whoever's there?

184
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,820
Sometimes it's whoever is available.

185
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,740
That's happened to me where you turn around and you say, oh, hi, I don't know you.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,139
So the tradition is you have to kiss someone at midnight.

187
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,220
So this is for good luck.

188
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:07,460
Yes.

189
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,539
For good luck in the new year.

190
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:12,039
So if you don't kiss someone, then you're kind of breaking the tradition.

191
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,919
And it's unlucky.

192
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,379
An interesting way of celebrating years.

193
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:21,120
This is, as we said, in the United States, watching the ball drop, kissing someone at midnight.

194
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:29,799
So we are really curious to know how you celebrate your New Year's in your country, because maybe you have similar traditions or very different things.

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,360
That's right.

196
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,700
And I know some places like Italy even have special foods you are supposed to eat to bring wealth and prosperity in the new year.

197
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,379
So let us know.

198
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,960
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

199
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:39,460
All right.

200
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:40,100
We'll see you guys there.

201
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,399
Bye.

202
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
