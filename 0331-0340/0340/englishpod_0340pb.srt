00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine and it's the start of a very new year so we have some interesting vocabulary for you today about the new year.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So we are starting a new year.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why don't we just jump right into this dialogue.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's see what's going on and we'll be back in a bit.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's almost midnight.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're about to start a brand new year.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I know.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's so exciting.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
A new year is always like a clean slate.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Do you have a new year's resolution?

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I was thinking about it but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That seems reasonable.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sure.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, we can't break tradition.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's bad luck.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Alright, so we've prepared a couple of different words for you on language takeaway.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Language takeaway.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Alright, the first word we have is actually a phrase.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We have this phrase brand new.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Something is a brand new thing.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's right.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We said that we are starting a brand new year and that's just another way of saying completely new.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So I want a brand new bicycle.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It means I want a new bicycle from the store, not one from the garage.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it's something completely new, never been used.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So we're starting a brand new year and we're saying it's exciting because it's a great opportunity like having a clean slate.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So a clean slate.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now this is an interesting phrase because you might not know what a slate is, but basically it means that you start from the very beginning.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So there's no history.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's nothing that you have to worry about.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You start completely new.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's a clean slate.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So just imagine you're in class and you have the whiteboard or the chalkboard and you just erase everything and then you start again.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's kind of what it means to have a clean slate, a new start.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Exactly.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And so we have a clean slate.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We need to talk about what we will do with the clean slate.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And so one person asks the other, do you have any new year's resolutions?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So this is one of the most popular things during the new years is people make a new year's resolution.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So a resolution is something that you have decided you will do.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have many resolutions.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I will learn to play the piano this year.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So in the new year, I will do this thing.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So it's basically like a promise, something that you promise yourself that you will do in the new year.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So as you say, maybe start playing the piano.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's right.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we call that a resolution or if we want to be specific, we call it a new year's resolution.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, at the very end of the dialogue, we heard another phrase.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is quite strange.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They want to kiss at midnight.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And the one person says, well, we can't break tradition.

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To break a tradition or to break tradition.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And that basically means to not do something that we usually do.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So you can follow tradition.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That means that you do the same thing maybe every year.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But if you break tradition, that means you don't do what you are expected to do.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So remember, that verb is to break.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Break tradition.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All right.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So let's review this vocab.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's almost midnight.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We're about to start a brand new year.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I know.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's so exciting.

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A new year is always like a clean slate.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you have a new year's resolution?

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That seems reasonable.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sure.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, we can't break tradition.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's bad luck.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So let's take a look at those phrases now on Fluency Builder.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So there's a phrase in here that I use all the time.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We heard about this resolution to go to the gym more often.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And the person said, you know, I never really go to the gym.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And the other said, you know, I know what you mean.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, that's right.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
She says, yeah, I know what you mean.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And so basically we use this when you agree with the person, you understand what they are saying.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, it's almost like saying I had the same experience.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So maybe I also belong to a gym and I never go to that gym, just like you.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So it means I know what you mean.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have the same problem.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's right.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So you can just agree with someone, completely agree with someone by saying, yeah, I know what you mean or I know what you mean.

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I know what you mean.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
All right.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So, well, this year we want to keep things a little bit more simple.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And we said, well, maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So think about this.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
To get together with friends.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Lots of words there.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But you can see friends.

121
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But to get together means to be social with, to hang out with, to do things together.

122
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But it's not very specific.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a nice way to say just to be with your friends.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So maybe you are going with your friends out, maybe shopping, maybe to the movies.

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So you say, yeah, I'm going to get together with my friends later on this afternoon.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right.

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So we can get together with friends as a resolution.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's something we want to do in the near future.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But for now, we're going to get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's the New Year's plan.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So it may seem strange.

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's not actually a phrasal verb or a colloquial phrase.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There is actually a ball that goes down as the countdown begins to midnight.

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And once it completely disappears, then, you know, you celebrate the New Year.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So you actually see this big round ball coming down in Times Square.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a way to count down to the New Year.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So people often say ten, nine, eight, seven.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So the countdown and the ball will drop.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And that means it's the New Year.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So this is something that we refer to.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's something we talk about when we want to discuss the New Year.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So we'll watch the ball drop together.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's an event.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's right.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
OK.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So a lot of great stuff there.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's almost midnight.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're about to start a brand new year.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I know it's so exciting.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A new year is always like a clean slate, a fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you have a New Year's resolution?

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolutions.

157
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That seems reasonable.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sure.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, we can't break tradition.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's bad luck.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So talking about New Year's, everyone makes New Year's resolutions and people get together to watch the ball drop in Times Square.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now, this is more of an American thing.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Have you ever experienced anything different from New Year's, some other type of tradition?

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because also here they kiss at midnight.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, that's a pretty standard American tradition.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
People will get together and they'll have the TV on.

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They'll have a party or they'll be with friends and they will maybe watch some fireworks or watch the TV as the ball drops.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I've done both.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've gone out because sometimes you go outside.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's very cold.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But you go to a bridge or a park or somewhere public or the city government or the state will have some kind of special fireworks display.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So then everyone will watch the fireworks or watch a big TV screen.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And then when it's midnight, when it's the new year, then everyone will kiss.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So everyone will kiss maybe.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I mean, is it like just between couples or whoever is available, you kiss whoever's there?

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Sometimes it's whoever is available.

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's happened to me where you turn around and you say, oh, hi, I don't know you.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So the tradition is you have to kiss someone at midnight.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So this is for good luck.

188
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
For good luck in the new year.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So if you don't kiss someone, then you're kind of breaking the tradition.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And it's unlucky.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
An interesting way of celebrating years.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is, as we said, in the United States, watching the ball drop, kissing someone at midnight.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So we are really curious to know how you celebrate your New Year's in your country, because maybe you have similar traditions or very different things.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I know some places like Italy even have special foods you are supposed to eat to bring wealth and prosperity in the new year.

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So let us know.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We'll see you guys there.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Bye.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
