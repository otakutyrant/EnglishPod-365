00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com It's almost midnight.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're about to start a brand new year.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I know.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's so exciting.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A new year is always like a clean slate.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Do you have a new year's resolution?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, I know what you mean.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That seems reasonable.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Sure.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, we can't break tradition.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's bad luck!
