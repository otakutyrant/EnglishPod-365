00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:08,099
EnglishPod.com It's almost midnight.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,380
We're about to start a brand new year.

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:11,279
I know.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,320
It's so exciting.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,259
A new year is always like a clean slate.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,019
A fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,100
Do you have a new year's resolution?

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,719
I was thinking about it, but I'm never able to keep my new year's resolutions.

9
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,320
Last year, for example, I joined a gym and only went twice.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Yeah, I know what you mean.

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:32,600
That's why this year I am keeping things more simple.

12
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,000
Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time or doing some volunteering work.

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,200
That seems reasonable.

14
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,719
We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:42,539
Sure.

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,420
As long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight.

17
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,240
Well, we can't break tradition.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,280
It's bad luck!
