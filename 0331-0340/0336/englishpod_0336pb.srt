00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Catherine and it's the holiday season.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today we have a lesson all about a special December holiday.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right, we are getting close to Christmas and of course today we are going to talk about Christmas in the United States and some of the typical traditions that you see over there.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right, so we're going to be looking at a family as they wait for Christmas morning to arrive.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If you don't know what that is, don't worry, you'll hear us talk about it in a moment, but first let's listen to our dialogue.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I even left out some milk.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came downstairs.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hmm, well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree spying on him.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Really?

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Really, let's go back upstairs and get back to bed.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That way we can let Santa do his job, then when you wake up it will be Christmas already.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey, honey, is that you?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't eat all the cookies.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want some too.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, I just said it, but here's that phrase again, Christmas morning.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right, so Christmas morning is December 25th in the morning, right?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, so the tradition is that small children will wake up early and run downstairs and they will find Christmas presents under the Christmas tree, and so this is the Christmas morning tradition.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Many countries, they celebrate Christmas on Christmas Eve, the 24th, right?

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright, so Christmas Eve is December 24th, Christmas Day, or if it's in the morning, Christmas morning is December 25th.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And as you said, kids come downstairs or go to where the Christmas tree is to look for their presents that Santa came and left for them.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right, so the idea, the story is that Santa comes at night, late at night, and brings presents for the children, and when the children wake up, they see the presents, but Santa has already gone.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So Santa is a man, he's kind of a mythical figure with a big white beard and a red outfit and a red hat.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Right.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So his name is Santa Claus, or just Santa.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There are many, many different names for Santa in different cultures and different countries.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, some people like to call him Saint Nick or Saint Nicholas, but most people will call him Santa in America.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So this is what happens, part of what happens during Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and usually also, boys and girls will find our stockings that will be filled with candy or small toys as well.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right, stockings are basically socks.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But these are special socks that you don't wear, you hang them, and a lot of people like to put them on the fireplace.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They hang them from the fireplace, and like you said, Marco, they're filled with sweets.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The story says that boys and girls who are nice get good things, like sweets and toys, and boys and girls who are naughty get coal.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that's that black material that we use to make a barbecue, for example.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, exactly.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's very dirty, and it's not something you want in your stocking.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So that's what we get in our stockings.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And now when the small boy and his father were talking, they were saying that he should go back to bed and not hide behind the tree.

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So if they're in the living room or they're downstairs in the house, what tree do they have?

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We're not talking about a big real tree outside, we're talking about the Christmas tree.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But you know, it's a long phrase, the Christmas tree, we don't have to say it that way.

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When we have a Christmas tree inside the house, we can just call it the tree.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, and the Christmas tree, as many of you may have seen already, is a pine tree usually, and you put decorations on it, and the presents go under it.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's right, so you might hear this phrase, there are presents under the tree, or there are many nice presents under the tree.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That means there are lots of nice presents under the Christmas tree.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And well, the kid wanted to stay behind the tree and spy on Santa Claus.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right, so this is a verb, to spy.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This means to watch someone, but to watch them while they don't know that you're watching them.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So you're hiding, but looking at someone else.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right, you're spying.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is where the noun comes, a spy, like James Bond.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:17,000
James Bond spies, he is a very famous spy, that's right, but in this case, the boy does not want Santa Claus to see him, so he is spying on Santa Claus.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Alright, very good stuff, why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and review this vocab.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings, so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies, I even left out some milk.

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came downstairs.

64
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Hmm, well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree spying on him.

65
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Really?

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Really?

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed, that way we can let Santa do his job, then when you wake up, it will be Christmas already.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay.

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hey honey, is that you?

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't eat all the cookies, I want some too.

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at three phrases on Fluency Builder.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Fluency Builder.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Alright, so Marco, there's another great phrase in here that we often use just around Christmas, what is it that Santa Claus does?

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, the way Santa Claus leaves presents for boys and girls is that he will come down the chimney, and we saw that when the dad said, well Santa Claus won't come down the chimney if you're here hiding behind the tree.

75
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Alright, so the chimney is part of the fireplace.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A fireplace is where you have a fire in your house to keep warm, and the chimney is where the smoke goes to come outside.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But Santa Claus goes the other way, he comes down the chimney from the roof into your house.

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right, and then he leaves the presents.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So the father said, alright, so you know, stop spying on Santa, let's go back upstairs and get back to bed.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Alright, get back to bed.

81
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a phrase that you're going to hear parents say a lot to their children, so if the children are awake or are walking around, you say get back to bed, that means go back to sleep.

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go back to sleep, that's right.

83
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And we want the kid to go back to sleep so we can let Santa do his job.

84
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Alright, like that last phrase, this is a phrase that you can use in other ways, it's not just for Christmas, but we said, you know, let Santa do his job, let Santa leave his presents, let's not bother Santa, but we can change Santa with any other name.

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right, so you can say, I don't know, maybe your dad is working in the office and your mom will tell you, you know, come out here, let dad do his job.

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That means don't bother dad, don't distract him, let him work.

87
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right, okay, so that's the way that you use those phrases, very good stuff here, why don't we review one last time.

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What are you doing awake?

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can't sleep.

90
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But it's almost midnight.

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Exactly, I'm too excited for Christmas morning.

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Also, I thought I heard Santa.

93
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Really?

94
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How do you know it was Santa?

95
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings, so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies.

96
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I even left out some milk.

97
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came downstairs.

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hmm, well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree, spying on him.

99
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Really?

100
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Really, let's go back upstairs and get back to bed, that way we can let Santa do his job.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Then, when you wake up, it will be Christmas already.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, honey, is that you?

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't eat all the cookies, I want some too.

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Alright, so these Christmas traditions are, as we said, they're typically American, but many other cultures share similar traditions like this.

106
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's correct.

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So, obviously, traditions are different in every family, not everyone celebrates Christmas morning, some people celebrate Christmas Eve, but most people will be familiar with Christmas stockings, Christmas trees, and Santa who comes down the chimney.

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right, so it also depends, I guess, on the culture and religion, some religions celebrate Christmas differently, or not at all.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, it's actually a very interesting time of the year, but if you look, or if you can see any American movies, like I remember this one called The Santa Claus, it's very, you can see the typical American Christmas, you know, snow, and trees, and presents, and Santa Claus, a lot of things.

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, a good way to end this would be to say have a very Merry Christmas, that means, you know, have a nice holiday, enjoy Christmas.

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you're not going to celebrate Christmas for whatever reason, you can just say Happy Holidays.

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Happy Holidays, that's right.

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And, of course, you can go to our website, EnglishPod.com, where we want to know if you celebrate Christmas, or what are the Christmas traditions in your country.

115
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right, we're very curious to hear those, so we'll see you soon on EnglishPod.com.

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Alright, we'll see you guys.

117
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bye.

118
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bye.

119
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Bye.
