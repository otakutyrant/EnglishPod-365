00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine, and it's the holiday season, Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
People are eating large meals with their families, and I think oftentimes when you cook a lot of food, you have something extra at the end.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do we call that?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we're going to talk about leftovers.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Leftovers.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's the extra food after your meal that you eat later, maybe the next day.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So, you know, during Christmas or during some holidays, we cook so much food that obviously we can't eat it all, so we put it back in the refrigerator and then we eat it later.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So those are called leftovers.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's listen to this dialogue about leftovers, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss what's happening in the dialogue.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What's for dinner?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Leftovers.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Leftovers of what and from when?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
From last night.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I took the leftover turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise, and made some sandwiches.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Isn't that dangerous, though?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I mean, bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, I didn't leave the turkey at room temperature for more than an hour, and I refrigerated soon after we finished eating.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Also, when reheating, I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, okay.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm just afraid of getting food poisoning.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't worry about it.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All right.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So a lot of vocab there.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's take a look at it in Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So, Marco, there's one cooking term, really, in this dialogue that is, it's a little bit different from the others.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So let's start with that.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's diced.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We were talking about taking some peppers or diced peppers.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So when you dice a vegetable or anything that you're cooking, basically you're making little pieces, little squares almost.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So you can cut something many different ways.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can cut big pieces and small pieces, but diced peppers, diced is a specific way to cut something in small, like you say, small squares.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And so in recipes, you will often see this instruction, dice the peppers, or, in this case, the peppers are diced.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So we took some turkey, mixed it with diced peppers and a lot of things, and the roommate was a little bit concerned about bacteria and germs.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So bacteria and germs, these sound like very scientific words.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bacteria is something that grows on, well, everything really, but if you leave food out, for example, it gets bacteria, or germs are things that can make you sick.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And so we need to avoid these things in the kitchen because they make us unhealthy, and that's why we wash our hands and things like that.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But when you have food that's left out, the risk is what, Marco?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is that you get bacteria or germs on it, yeah.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it's dangerous, like especially with meat, if you leave it out, it's very, very dangerous because you can get some bacteria that will make you sick.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And the reason why we're a little bit concerned, especially with meats, is if you leave it out, after cooking it, at room temperature.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All right.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So room temperature is the temperature of a normal room.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Maybe it's 65 degrees or what's 25 degrees Celsius.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's the temperature of the inside of a room, and so it's not cold.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not hot.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's just normal.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And when we leave food out, especially meat, like you're saying, we have to be careful.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can't leave it out for very long if it's something like eggs or milk or what we call perishables.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So actually, here comes the other two words that are a little bit of a contrast.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to talk about food that is reheated or refrigerated.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So the roommate is explaining, don't worry.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We have done these things to this food, so it's safe.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So one thing you can do to food to make it safe to kill germs is to reheat it.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That means, well, you know the word heated, right?

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's to make something hot.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But how is that different from reheated?

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, because you cooked it already, so it was warm.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now it went a little bit cold because it's at room temperature.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So in order to make sure that it's safe to eat and you kill that bacteria, you reheat it so you kind of cook it again a little bit.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, you cook it again.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And so with leftovers, we often have to reheat things because they were hot, then they were cold, and now we want them hot again.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So we reheat them.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The opposite of that would be refrigerate.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And this is what you should do.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you take something and put it in the refrigerator, what you are doing, the verb, the action is to refrigerate it.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So to refrigerate something means to make it cold.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know, there are important things that we refrigerate.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We refrigerate eggs, we refrigerate milk, we refrigerate butter.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
These are things that can make us sick if we don't make them cold.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Exactly.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So those are the two words.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now obviously, it's a little bit different because the prefix to reheat means to do it again while to refrigerate means you're just making it cold.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, there are important terms and again, we also have the adjectives.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is reheated or refrigerated.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But there are another couple of phrases that are really important, so let's take a listen to those in Fluency Builder.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All right, so the first phrase we're going to take a look at is when one of the roommates says, hey, what's for dinner?

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's for dinner?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is a very, very standard phrase.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is something you'll hear at home, you'll hear with your friends.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's usually something we say that when someone is cooking food for dinner.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We're asking, what are we going to eat for dinner?

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Mom, what's for dinner?

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Exactly.

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I used to say that every single day when I came home from school.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, obviously, you don't want to say the long phrase, what are we going to have for dinner tonight?

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So you just say, what's for dinner?

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's for dinner?

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's for dinner?

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And then the answer would be lasagna or turkey sandwiches.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right, exactly.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now when they started talking about the leftover turkey, he was a little bit concerned as we said about bacteria and germs because it usually happens that you get this on food that was left out.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
All right.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So the verb here is to leave out, to leave something out.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It means to leave something or put something at room temperature.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So Marco, you and I are eating turkey, it's Thanksgiving, and we start to have coffee and dessert and the turkey is still in the room at room temperature.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We did not refrigerate it.

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That means it was left out.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How long was it left out?

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, maybe two hours.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right, right.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That means so it's not in a refrigerator.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's right.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's exactly what it means.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So maybe you go to sleep and you left the turkey out.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's still on the table maybe at room temperature.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh no, we can't eat it if we left it out for like 12 hours.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
All right.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So it's not good to leave food out.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And now what happens is if you do eat food that was left out for too long, you could get food poisoning.

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Now this is very serious and it's something that you should be very careful about when you're cooking.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Food poisoning is getting sick from your food.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
There are different kinds of food poisoning, but usually it makes you throw up, it makes your stomach hurt.

137
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's quite painful.

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's right.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so this is why we say you should wash your hands before you cook.

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You should make sure that you refrigerate meat because you want to avoid food poisoning.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's right.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And it comes from the noun poison, a poison, which is something that is harmful for your body.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's right.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There are many different kinds of poison.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But food poisoning means becoming sick, your body getting sick after you eat something bad.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So a lot of great stuff here.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We can review everything one last time.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's for dinner?

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Leftovers.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What?

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Leftovers of what and from when?

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
From last night.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I took the leftover turkey, mix it with some diced peppers and onions, add a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Isn't that dangerous though?

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I mean, bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, I didn't leave the turkey out of room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated soon after we finished eating.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Also, when reheating, I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, okay.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm just afraid of getting food poisoning.

162
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't worry about it.

163
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
All right.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So this is actually good advice about leftovers, about having something to eat.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But at the same time, I don't know how many people actually are very careful with these things.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
For example, pizza.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sometimes you leave pizza out on the table all night and the next morning you have some pizza.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I always refrigerate my pizza.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know people who leave their pizza out and then eat it, but there's cheese and sausage and you know, you want to refrigerate that stuff.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So I always wrap it in plastic and put it on a plate in the fridge.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You wrap it in plastic.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, because in the refrigerator there's also germs, so you need to make sure you cover your food.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right.

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And what about, have you ever had a bad case of food poisoning because of having leftovers?

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I've had food poisoning, but not because of leftovers, because as I said before, you know, I wrap things, I put them in the refrigerator, I'm very careful because I don't want to get sick or I don't want to get other people sick because, you know, Thanksgiving or Christmas, you have to give food to many other people and, you know, I don't want to make anyone sick.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And actually, you can get food poisoning not only from leftovers, but from maybe food that maybe was expired.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Sometimes cheese maybe can be expired, you didn't realize it and, you know, you get food poisoning.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Or from people who are cooking with things that are not clean.

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So you have something that's not clean or food that's not fresh and it makes you very sick.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's food poisoning.

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right.

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So it's an interesting thing, especially with, like I said, so many holidays where you cook so much food that people have a lot of leftovers.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And not only that, but even at restaurants, maybe you order too much so you have leftovers you want to take home to your dog or to have later.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I love leftovers.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let us know, do you have leftovers in your country?

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are there things that you should and shouldn't do when cooking?

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let us know.

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
All right.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We'll see you guys there.

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Bye.
