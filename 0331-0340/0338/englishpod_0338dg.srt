1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What's for dinner?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Leftovers.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Leftovers of what and from when?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
From last night.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I took the leftover turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, add a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Isn't that dangerous though?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well I didn't leave the turkey at room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated soon after we finished eating.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Also when reheating I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well okay.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm just afraid of getting food poisoning.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not only do you save money but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat.
