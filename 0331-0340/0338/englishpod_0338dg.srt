1
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:07,839
What's for dinner?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,220
Leftovers.

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:10,039
What?

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,060
Leftovers of what and from when?

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,539
From last night.

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:20,339
I took the leftover turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, add a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches.

7
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:22,140
Isn't that dangerous though?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,460
I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:32,579
Well I didn't leave the turkey at room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated soon after we finished eating.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,840
Also when reheating I put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees Celsius.

11
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,479
Well okay.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,479
I'm just afraid of getting food poisoning.

13
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,119
Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,200
Not only do you save money but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat.
