1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,000
EnglishPod.com and mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Away to the window I flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw open the sash.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
With a little old driver so lively and quick I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now dasher, now dancer, now prancer and vixen on comet, on cupid, on donder and blitzen to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleighs full of toys and Saint Nicholas too.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
As I drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He was dressed on fur from his head to his toe and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
His eyes how they twinkled, his dimples how merry.

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He was chubby and plump a right old jolly elf and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He spoke not a word but went straight to work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I heard him exclaim air as he drove out of sight Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.
