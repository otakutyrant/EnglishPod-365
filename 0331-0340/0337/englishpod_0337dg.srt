1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:36,439
EnglishPod.com and mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

2
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,979
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

3
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,859
Away to the window I flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw open the sash.

4
00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:02,859
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.

5
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,719
With a little old driver so lively and quick I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.

6
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,280
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

7
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:30,659
Now dasher, now dancer, now prancer and vixen on comet, on cupid, on donder and blitzen to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

8
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,859
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky.

9
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,540
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleighs full of toys and Saint Nicholas too.

10
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,159
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

11
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,980
As I drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.

12
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:05,219
He was dressed on fur from his head to his toe and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

13
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,199
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,379
His eyes how they twinkled, his dimples how merry.

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,580
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,719
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,699
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

18
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,439
He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

19
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,960
He was chubby and plump a right old jolly elf and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

20
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,800
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

21
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,759
He spoke not a word but went straight to work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk.

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,740
And laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose.

23
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,259
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

24
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,699
But I heard him exclaim air as he drove out of sight Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.
