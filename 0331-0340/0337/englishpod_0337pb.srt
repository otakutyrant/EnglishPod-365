00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Catherine, and a very merry Christmas to everyone.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right, merry Christmas.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We are at that time again where we are celebrating Christmas, we're having dinner with family and friends, we're giving presents, and, of course, there are some other traditions that come into play, like, for example, Santa Claus.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Santa Claus.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, we've got a very special advanced-level lesson for you today.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We've got a poem.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a very traditional poem that is read or listened to on the holiday, and we're going to talk a little bit about some of the interesting words and phrases that are used in this.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But first off, let's just listen to the poem itself.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nicholas soon would be there.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads, and Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters, and threw open the sash.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer, with a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Nick.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now Dasher!

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now Dancer!

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now Prancer and Vixen!

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
On Comet!

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
On Cupid!

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
On Donder and Blitzen!

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
To the top of the porch!

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To the top of the wall!

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleighs full of toys, and St.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Nicholas too.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
As I drew in my head and was turning round, down the chimney St.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Nicholas came with a bound.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He was dressed on fur from his head to his toe, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
His eyes, how they twinkled!

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
His dimples, how merry!

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow, and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He had a broad face in the little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He was chubby and plump, a right old jolly elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He spoke not a word, but went straight to work and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But I heard him exclaim, ere as he drove out of sight, Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What is the general story of the poem?

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The story of the poem is that Santa Claus is coming to visit someone's house, and there's a person in the story who is watching Santa Claus arrive, and he's seeing Santa Claus take the reindeer up onto the roof, come down the chimney, and lay the presents out for the children, filling the stockings as well.

51
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, so it's basically a nice poetic description of Santa Claus, and also it goes in to describe in a very nice way the way Santa Claus looks like.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's very descriptive.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We have descriptions of what Santa Claus looks like, what he's wearing, his smile, how he's a little bit fat.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We also have descriptions of the animals, these special animals that we hear about so often that are called reindeer.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All right, so we've divided up the poem into by line, so then it's going to be easier for you to go to the line that we're talking about.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's start with the first line, with this first word that's actually very interesting.

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house.

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So what does this first word mean?

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Twas is an abbreviation, so it's a shortened version, of it was.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, so, but do you actually use this now in, like, if you're writing?

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, this is not something I would use now in writing, and it's not something I would say.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's actually more of an archaic form, something that you might hear in poetry or historical writing.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, so it was the night before Christmas, right?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So we're talking about December 24th.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The night of December 24th, that's right.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, so the first two lines talk about how it was the night before Christmas, and in the house there was nothing stirring, not even a mouse.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So not even the smallest little animal, so it's very quiet in the house is what's happening.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So now we jump to line number seven where the poet describes, and mama in her kerchief and I in my cap.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So we know that the person talking is the dad, because he's talking about himself and mama, mother, they're in bed together, and mama in her kerchief and I in my cap.

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So I'm wearing a nightcap, a cover on my head, it's like a hat.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And mama has a kerchief.

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What's a kerchief?

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A kerchief is another abbreviation, it's short for handkerchief.

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And a handkerchief is a piece of fabric or cloth that sometimes we use for our noses when we have to blow our nose, but also you can use a kerchief in your hair to cover your hair.

75
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, so if you can imagine it, this must take place, I don't know, maybe 50, 60 years ago when dads used to wear hats to bed and women also handkerchiefs on their heads.

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Or longer, maybe 200 years ago when people wore these long night hats, night caps.

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The pajamas and everything.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Alright, now let's jump over to line 18 and 19 when he's talking about the reindeer and the sleigh arriving and he says, I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is another way of calling Santa Claus, right?

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Saint Nicholas is his name, but you also call him Claus or Santa Claus.

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, and then he said, more rapid than eagles, his coursers they came.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So the word order is a bit strange here.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is common in poetry.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We could also say, his coursers came more rapidly than eagles.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They were very, very fast.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But what are these coursers?

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We're talking about the animals pulling Santa Claus, and what are those animals again?

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're called reindeer.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Reindeer.

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So the reindeer are very, very fast.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, that's right, because he's making the comparison about how fast eagles are compared to them.

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And we hear their names, right?

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Exactly.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He goes on to say, now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer, and all of their names, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donder, and Blitzen.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
All eight reindeer.

97
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Each animal has its own name.

98
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So all eight reindeer.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Actually, we're missing one, though, that's very common nowadays, the reindeer that goes in the front, lighting, illuminating the sky.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You might know the song, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, that one.

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So there are actually nine reindeer nowadays, but I guess this story was before the Rudolph story came out.

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This is interesting, because those are the names of all the reindeer.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm not sure in which order they are, I don't know who's in the back, who's in the front.

107
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know either, but it's important to know that they're very fast, and they come down and then they go up.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
They have to take St.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Nicholas to the roof of the house, on top of the house.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's right, so now he arrives to the top of the house, line 32, we see, down the chimney St.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Nicholas came with a bound.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He came quickly down the chimney, boom, and at the end, he's all dressed in fur from his head to his foot, so top to bottom he has fur on.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right, and I think he's got fur because he lives in the North Pole, right?

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's right, and it's very cold where Santa Claus lives, so he has to wear these clothes that are very warm.

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay, and obviously since he is going up and down chimneys in line 34, we see, and his clothes were tarnished with ashes and soot.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So to tarnish, or tarnish means dirty.

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Something is tarnished if it's dirty, so his clothes, his fur clothes were dirty with ashes and soot.

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This means that, you know, in your fireplace, when the fire is gone, there's some gray and black stuff, and that's what's on Santa Claus' clothes.

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, very good, so, and then we go on to line 35, a bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right, a peddler, now this is not just something we talk about on Christmas, you know, we have peddlers all year round, what are peddlers, what do they do?

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Basically, they go around selling things, so maybe you see them in a small market or sometimes in different places and maybe, I don't know, on the streets, you see them selling little things like toys or combs or books, something like this.

122
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oranges, you see fruit peddlers, people who sell fruit, or you could see those watch peddlers, you know, they say, would you like a Rolex watch, that's a watch peddler.

123
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So that's what they do, right, they just, they're informal salesmen.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They don't have a store, they work on the street.

125
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So this is why Santa looks like a peddler.

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He isn't in a store, he has a bag, and he says, look in my bag.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Right, exactly.

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Now from line 37, we go on to describe the way Santa Claus looks like.

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So he says, his eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry.

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Dimples are those small circles on your cheeks, so some people when they smile, they have these small holes or circles, those are dimples, they're very cute.

131
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's right, so not everyone has them, right, some people when they smile, you can see those dimples.

132
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Alright, so, and his cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry, so we're saying that they're red.

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They're red, they're pink.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay, now in line 39, he says, his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow.

135
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Now droll is a word that some people still use, it's pretty common in places like England.

136
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We don't use it as much in America, we say funny instead, but something that is droll, d-r-o-l-l, droll, is funny.

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So his mouth, his face is funny looking.

138
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, his face is funny looking, alright.

139
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And going on to line 45, we're describing how he was chubby and plump, so we're basically saying he was a little bit fat, okay, and a right jolly old elf.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So what is an elf?

141
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
An elf is, actually normally we talk about elves, so one elf, two elves, as people, little people who help Santa.

142
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They're mythical creatures who live in the North Pole and who make presents.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So an elf is a small creature who makes presents, or maybe lives in the woods.

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There are many different stories with elves.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Elves, right, right, okay.

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And in line 46, we say, and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

147
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What does he mean by in spite of myself?

148
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is really important, and this is something we say in English all the time, in spite of myself.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So I laughed in spite of myself, so I didn't want to laugh.

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I wanted to be serious, but I did laugh, so in spite of myself, I didn't want to laugh.

151
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I laughed anyway.

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So you say, in spite of myself, when you did the thing you did not want to do.

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay.

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And finishing off, we are going towards the last three lines, where we say, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

155
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is a thistle?

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They're talking about the part of a flower that's a thistle.

157
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, okay, so they all flew away quickly, rapidly, like the little flower.

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, you know when a flower is sending its seeds out, it's down, it's white.

159
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So maybe if you blow on a flower with the white seeds, they blow away.

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's what it looks like.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It looks like the seeds of a flower being blown away.

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Very easy.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Line 55 says, but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight.

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So this is an older way of saying, as he drove out of sight, so as he's flying away, I can't see him anymore, almost I can't see him anymore, he exclaimed something.

165
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So ere means, you know, while this is happening.

166
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Now this is another one of those maybe old English words that we don't use anymore, right?

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You wouldn't really use ere.

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ere I was walking to school, I saw the milkman, no, we don't say this anymore, but you will find it in poetry and you might also find it in stories.

169
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And line 56, he ends, and this is the famous way that this poem ends by saying, happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Happy Christmas to all and to all a good night.

171
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And the first line of the poem are the most famous.

172
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Everyone knows these.

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Very good.

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So a beautiful poem.

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why don't we listen to it one more time?

176
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St.

178
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Nicholas soon would be there.

179
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.

180
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled down for a long winter's nap.

181
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

182
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw open the sash.

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St.

185
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Nick.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

187
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Now dasher, now dancer, now prancer and vixen, on comet, on cupid, on donder and blitzen, to the top of the porch, to the top of the wall, now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

188
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricanes fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

189
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew with the sleighs full of toys, and St.

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Nicholas too.

191
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof, the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St.

193
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Nicholas came with a bound.

194
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his toe, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

195
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
His eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry.

197
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry, his droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow, and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

198
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.

199
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He had a broad face and a little round belly, that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

200
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
He was chubby and plump, a right old jolly elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.

201
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head, soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

202
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He spoke not a word, but went straight to work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.

203
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod up the chimney he rose.

204
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
But I heard him exclaim, ere as he drove out of sight, Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

206
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's right.

207
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's a classic.

208
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's something that you think about people listening to in front of the fireplace, and they're, you know, they're drinking their eggnog and talking about how wonderful, you know, family is.

209
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And so yeah, it's a classic.

210
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's something that we often talk about and read and listen to.

211
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
All right, so it's very interesting because it's part of the American tradition of Christmas.

212
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think maybe also in other parts of the world, the poem might be translated or also might be popular.

213
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But you know, Santa Claus and all these things are traditions that are observed in some countries, and it's very interesting to understand them.

214
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Absolutely, and I'm very curious to know about your Christmas traditions.

215
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What do you do in your home country on Christmas Eve or on Christmas Day?

216
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Do you know any poems like this, or do you listen to this poem in translation?

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let us know.

218
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

219
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
All right, guys, we'll see you there, and have a Merry Christmas.

220
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Merry Christmas.

221
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Bye.

222
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Merry Christmas.

223
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Merry Christmas.
