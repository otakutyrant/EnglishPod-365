00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking a little bit about more small talk.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right, we're going to continue our series.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is part nine, so we're coming close to the end of our ten-part series.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And today we're following Melissa and Michelle as they discuss very casually their personal life, specifically about their marriages or getting married.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So this one's a little bit more difficult than the last few.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue, and when we come back we'll be talking about some of those phrases that you heard.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, Michelle, jumping quick.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's pouring out there.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, hi, Melissa.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you going to the conference too?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I was planning to pick up Mr.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Campbell.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, he told me.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, I see.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, so I heard you got married.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, thank you.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm very excited.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It was wonderful.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That sounds so romantic.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We just don't have the money.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I know what you mean.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive, don't you?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I sure do.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Definitely.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, there's Mr.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Campbell.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Driver, can you stop here, please?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So a lot of interesting phrases in this dialogue more than vocab.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So we're going to have two fluency builders.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's start with the first one now.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fluency builder.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The first phrase in today's fluency builder is the phrase jump in.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So Melissa says, hey, Michelle, jump in quick.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So Melissa is actually in a taxi and that's why she's saying jump in quick.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So she is directing Michelle to do something.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
She's saying jump in.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So it's actually her telling Melissa, get in the car.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's right.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so we can use this phrase to jump in somewhere, which means you're going to do it very quickly.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, to go somewhere, to get in a place very quickly.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We could say it about a cab, but we could also say it about a swimming pool.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Maybe I'm swimming in the water and I say, Marco, jump in.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The water's nice.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's right.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Or maybe you just got back from the gym and you're going to jump in the shower really quick and before you go out again.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're not actually going to jump like you jump the action, but you're going to get into the shower very quickly.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's right.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And of course, Melissa tells Michelle to jump in the cab quickly because it's pouring out there.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's pouring what's pouring, pouring, pouring water, pouring wine.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's actually, yeah, it's pouring water out there.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It means it's raining very, very hard.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So it's not just drizzling a little, little bit.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's raining very hard.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's pouring rain.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So we don't have to say the word rain.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We can just say it's pouring.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:28,000
As you can see in that sentence, Melissa doesn't say at any time it's raining, but we understand that when somebody says it's pouring out there, you know, that means it's raining very hard.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can't be chocolate.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can't be chocolate.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Can't be dogs or cats.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right?

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So, um, Michelle gets in the cab and she says, well, we have to pick up Mr.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Campbell, Mr.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Campbell.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We need to pick him up at the hotel.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The verb here is to pick up.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now we want to just remember this as a phrasal verb.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You pick someone up in your car.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You could even pick someone up on your bicycle.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, but you can see that you can say we need to pick up Tommy at the hotel, or you can say we need to pick Tommy up so you can use it both ways.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can put the noun in between or after.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So can you pick me up at five?

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Right.

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Or can you pick up the clothes at the dry cleaners?

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It means to go collect something.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So you can use it in different ways.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can put the noun in between pickup or you can put it after.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And uh, all right, so they're going to go pick up Mr.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Campbell.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Now they're talking, uh, well, they're kind of gossiping a little bit.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They said, well, I heard you got married.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I heard, now this is a very, very common way to start a sentence that might have some gossip in it.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I'm going to say something that, um, might or might not be true.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So you're not really sure if it's true or not.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So this is why you start with the sentence.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I heard that something, something, something.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So in this case, she said, I heard you got married.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Or I heard you got married because I'm, I'm basically saying, well, some rumor made it to me and I, and I heard that you got married, but I'm not sure.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So she's asking, did you get married?

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Uh, if so, congratulations.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So it's a very common way of starting a sentence when you are talking to someone and maybe you want them to confirm this news or this gossip or this rumor is true or not.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I heard you got a promotion.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's right.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Congratulations.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So that's the way that you use this phrase.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I heard you, or, well, if you're using another person, I heard that, uh, Tom, uh, got divorced.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I heard Susie had a baby.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All right.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So that's all for the first part of fluency builder.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's take a break and we'll be back in a bit with part two.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey, Michelle, jumping quick.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's pouring out there.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, hi Melissa.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you going to the conference too?

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was planning to pick up Mr.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Campbell.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He told me we need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, I see.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So I heard you got married.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Congratulations.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, thank you.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm very excited.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It was wonderful.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That sounds so romantic.

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We just don't have the money.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I know what you mean.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't you?

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I sure do.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Definitely.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, there's Mr.

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Campbell.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Driver, can you stop here, please?

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
All right, so now we're back with part two of fluency builder.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's get started with the first phrase.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When she says that they got married on holiday, what does that mean?

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
On holiday is another way of saying on vacation.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So while we were having a holiday somewhere, this happened.

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So you could say, we decided to get married on holiday.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
That means when they were traveling, when they were on vacation, they got married.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So it's kind of more of a British way of saying, right, on holiday?

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You could say, where did you go on holiday?

165
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But maybe in America, we prefer to say, where did you go on vacation?

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So both are correct.

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can say, we got married while on holiday, or we got married while on vacation.

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Both are correct.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's just a little bit of difference between British English and American English.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then moving on, she said, well, they also wanted to get married, Michelle did, but they had to postpone their wedding.

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, to postpone something means to wait until later to do it.

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So you maybe want to do it today, but it's raining today, so you have to postpone until next week.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So it's kind of like you had to delay, you had to wait.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, that's right.

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So you could say that because of bad weather, the picnic will be postponed until next month.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So that's the way they use postpone.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now it's interesting because you have a P in between there, so it's postpone.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Postpone, yeah.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's an interesting word to pronounce.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And well, they also had to postpone it because of money, you know, it's just very expensive.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And Melissa agrees by saying, I know what you mean.

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I know what you mean.

185
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Now this is a really common phrase and this is something you'll hear with more relaxed conversations between friends.

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It means I understand the situation or I feel the same way.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So in this case, we just don't have the money.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Melissa's saying, I know what you mean.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It means I'm having a hard time with money too.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't have much money either.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So you understand what she's talking about.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You also agree.

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I know what you mean.

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's just a way of agreeing with someone.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All right.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And then she goes on to confirm what Michelle is saying by saying, I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
All right.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is a really, really key sentence structure here.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We have more and more, more and more, and then after that we have an adjective.

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So the structure is more and more adjectives.

202
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So more and more spicy, more and more funny, more and more expensive.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So in this case, the city is more expensive than it was before.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That's right.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And it's still getting more expensive.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right.

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's the main idea when you use this structure is that when you say more and more and then you add an adjective such as expensive or beautiful, it means that it continues to grow.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It continues to get more expensive or more beautiful or more difficult.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But remember that we are using adjectives here that are, when you're using the comparative, you can't say, for example, you can't use funny.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You can't say you are getting more and more funny because obviously the comparative for funny is funnier.

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So just be careful with that one because it could be a little bit confusing.

212
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And to finish off our Fluency Builder, we have Michelle who agrees with Melissa and says, yeah, you know, I think Shanghai is getting more expensive.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And she says, I sure do.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So she's basically agreeing.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
She's saying, yes, that's true.

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But why does she say I sure do?

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why doesn't she say agree?

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I agree or yeah, you're right.

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well she doesn't have to say it because she says I do.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The question before that was, I think something, something, don't you?

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And she says, I do.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And I don't think that.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So it's assumed that she also thinks this.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
She's answering a question.

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's right.

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it's an interesting way of asking a question when you say, I think the city is beautiful, don't you?

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So the proper way to answer that would be I do or I sure do.

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
All right.

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So that's all the time we have for Fluency Builder.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's listen to her dialogue one last time.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hey, Michelle, jumping quick, it's pouring out there.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh, hi, Melissa.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you going to the conference too?

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was planning to pick up Mr.

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Campbell.

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, he told me.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, I see.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
OK, so I heard you got married.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, thank you.

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm very excited.

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead.

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It was wonderful.

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That sounds so romantic.

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We just don't have the money.

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I know what you mean.

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive, don't you?

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I sure do.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Definitely.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, there's Mr.

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Campbell.

255
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Driver, can you stop here, please?

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All right, so we're reaching the end of our small talk series.

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In this case, it's two women who are talking about their personal lives.

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And not only that, they're talking about weddings and they're talking about money.

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So this is a very interesting way to talk about these very common topics, personal life, love, and especially money.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But remember, in American culture, these are the kinds of things you would only talk to your friends about.

261
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You wouldn't really want to talk to strangers about money, personal life, marriage, because those are considered private.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So be careful when you're talking to people you don't know very well.

263
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right.

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And actually, your feedback was very interesting when we discussed about if it's OK to ask, for example, a woman her age or her weight or a man's salary.

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So in most places, you said that it wasn't really correct.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But this is the very interesting thing about the cultural differences and what is appropriate to talk about.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's right.

269
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So again, if you have any questions or comments about the things we talked about here today or any of our older lessons about small talk, please just let us know.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All right, guys.

272
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We'll see you there.

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Bye.
