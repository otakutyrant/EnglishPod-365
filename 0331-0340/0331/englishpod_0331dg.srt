EnglishPod.com Hey, Michel.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Jump in quick.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's pouring out there.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, hi Melissa.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you going to the conference too?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I was planning to pick up Mr.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Campbell.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, he told me.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, I see.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, so I heard you got married.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Congratulations.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, thank you.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm very excited.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It was wonderful.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That sounds so romantic.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We just don't have the money.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I know what you mean.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't you?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I sure do.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Definitely.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, there's Mr.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Campbell.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Driver, can you stop here, please?
