EnglishPod.com Hey, Michel.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,759
Jump in quick.

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:14,980
It's pouring out there.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,120
Oh, hi Melissa.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,100
Are you going to the conference too?

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:21,859
I was planning to pick up Mr.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,179
Campbell.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,339
Yes, he told me.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,920
We need to pick him up at his hotel and then go to the conference.

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,839
Oh, I see.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,359
Okay, so I heard you got married.

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,239
Congratulations.

13
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, thank you.

14
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,299
I'm very excited.

15
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,539
We were going to get married next year, but then we decided to get married on holiday instead.

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,659
It was wonderful.

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,700
That sounds so romantic.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,200
Jack and I were hoping to get married in Europe next year, but we had to postpone our plans.

19
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,799
We just don't have the money.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,380
I know what you mean.

21
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:54,380
I think Shanghai is getting more and more expensive.

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,200
Don't you?

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,159
I sure do.

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,020
In my opinion, it's actually becoming more expensive than back home.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:00,820
Definitely.

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,320
Oh, there's Mr.

27
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:02,659
Campbell.

28
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,420
Driver, can you stop here, please?
