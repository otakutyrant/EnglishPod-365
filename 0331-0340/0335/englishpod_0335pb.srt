00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:03,220
Hello everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:03,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,240
My name is Catherine, and we're going to have some fun today, Marco, right?

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,019
That's right.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,140
Today we are taking a small kid and we're going to the park.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,240
And we're going to play.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,759
Okay, so there are fun things you can do at the park.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,940
We're going to learn all about them.

9
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:18,600
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,480
Hey, honey.

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,420
Where were you?

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,339
I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

13
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:30,480
How was it?

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,620
Were there a lot of kids?

15
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:34,359
It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time.

16
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,659
We got on the seesaw together, then went on a couple of different slides, and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:41,939
Sounds like fun.

18
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,119
When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,259
Yeah, but today he was really hyper.

20
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:49,219
He even got under the monkey bars.

21
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,020
And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour.

22
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,439
I'm exhausted.

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,359
You should go to the park more often, since you don't go to the gym anymore.

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,459
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of this great playground equipment on Language Takeaway.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:18,400
Language Takeaway So, as you said, Marco, today we're focusing in Language Takeaway on some of these things you can do at the park.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,299
Now, the first one is one of my personal favorites from childhood, called the seesaw.

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,200
The seesaw, that's right.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:34,459
And so basically it's that long piece of, or sometimes metal or wood, and two people sit at each opposite end.

29
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:38,560
Yes, and so when one person goes down, the other person goes up.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,420
And when that person goes down, the other person goes up.

31
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:42,439
So it's a seesaw.

32
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,140
That's right.

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,319
So yes, it's actually a very common toy that you can play with at the playground.

34
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,260
But also another very common one I'm sure everyone knows and has been on is a slide.

35
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,540
A slide.

36
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,659
Now this is a bit hard to describe, actually.

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,640
Slides are usually quite colorful, but they're like tubes that are open, and the child can go down.

38
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:10,020
So you're on top, maybe two meters high, and then you go down the slide and you come down to the ground.

39
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:20,240
That's right, and actually it's the noun, a slide, but what you do, the verb is you actually slide down the slide.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,500
Yes, and sometimes you go very fast, and it's scary.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,580
That's right.

42
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:30,180
And well, if you want to have something a little bit less scary, you can go into the jungle gym.

43
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,500
Alright, jungle.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,639
Now the jungle is actually a place.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,180
In South America, for example, you have jungles with lots of trees and monkeys and everything.

46
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:50,460
But a jungle gym is like many, many different metal bars or wood together to make this open structure that boys and girls can climb on.

47
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,340
So basically you start on the ground and you climb all the way up it.

48
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,099
Okay, so I think this is why it's called kind of like a jungle gym, right?

49
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,360
Because you can climb up and down and grab all these bars.

50
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,800
You can hang like a monkey from the bars.

51
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,520
Yeah, so basically it's just a cage that boys and girls can climb on and play with.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,759
Right, and I guess you call it a jungle gym because when you're doing all this, you're doing exercise.

53
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:14,340
That's right.

54
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,699
Alright, so now maybe for the smaller kids who just want to play with some toys, they can just hang out at the sandbox.

55
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,979
Alright, this is one word, but it's actually quite literal.

56
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,680
You'd have sand in a box.

57
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,280
That's right.

58
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:37,479
And a sandbox is very safe and very fun because boys and girls can make castles or dig, but there's nothing to it really.

59
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,319
It's just a box.

60
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,960
It's just a box with sand, literally.

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,780
Yes, that's right.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,580
So that's also fun for the smaller kids to be at the sandbox.

63
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,560
Now, going back to something very similar to the jungle gym, we have the monkey bars.

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,199
Okay, now monkey bars are a very important part of the park.

65
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
These are horizontal bars, so they're across.

66
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,379
And you hang on them with your arms, so your body hangs down, and when you hang, your feet are off the ground.

67
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,599
It's very tall.

68
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,080
Right.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,060
And you have to move.

70
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,300
You have to change from one bar to the other, so it's like a ladder that you're pulling yourself across.

71
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:13,319
Yes, exactly.

72
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,240
So you've probably seen it exactly how you describe it.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,639
It's a ladder, and you've just got to hang on to the different bars with your arms.

74
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
It's actually quite difficult to do.

75
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,259
I always used to get upset because I couldn't go all the way across because, you know, you go from one end to the other end.

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,939
But my arms would get so tired that I had to drop down onto the ground.

77
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,319
Exactly.

78
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:40,519
All right, well, something that's a little bit less exhausting but also very fun are when you go on the swings.

79
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,000
All right, swings are great.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,779
Now, swings are kind of like chairs, but they don't have a back.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,920
So you sit down on a piece that's maybe plastic, and someone behind you will push you because you're on these hanging chairs.

82
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,319
And they'll push you, and you go forward and backward, and you can go very, very high, and then you come back down.

83
00:04:59,319 --> 00:04:59,879
Exactly.

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,399
So these are swings.

85
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,100
All of this equipment you've most likely seen at any of the parks that are nearby.

86
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,319
But we're going to post some pictures as well so you can see more clearly what they're all about.

87
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,459
Now let's go and review the dialogue again before we move on to Fluency Builder.

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,439
Hey, honey.

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,379
Where were you?

90
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:27,319
I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

91
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,459
How was it?

92
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Were there a lot of kids?

93
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,339
It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time.

94
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,639
We got on the seesaw together, then went on a couple of different slides, and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.

95
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,920
Sounds like fun.

96
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,079
When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

97
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah, but today he was really hyper.

98
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,220
He even got under the monkey bars.

99
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:50,000
And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour.

100
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,420
I'm exhausted.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,360
You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore.

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,779
Alright, we're back.

103
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,899
So now let's take a look at three phrases on Fluency Builder.

104
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:11,759
So our first phrase today is actually something that the parent is talking about.

105
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,660
She wants to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Now, what does it mean to go get fresh air?

107
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,480
Well, basically it means to go out and maybe walk or just be outside and get air from the outside.

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,639
Because sometimes you're in your house all the time and that's not fresh air.

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,420
That's right.

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,379
So basically this means exactly what you're saying.

111
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,560
It means going outside.

112
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,920
So kids often need to go get some fresh air, but also adults do too.

113
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:43,160
Sometimes I feel like when I'm working in the office for a long time, I really need to get some fresh air.

114
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,519
So that means I go outside for a walk.

115
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:46,079
Exactly.

116
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:49,939
And you can tell your friends, oh, excuse me for a minute.

117
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm going to go get some fresh air.

118
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,399
Or you know what?

119
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,480
You're looking a little bit pale.

120
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,759
Maybe you should go get some fresh air.

121
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,339
Exactly.

122
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,079
And talking about all this great equipment and how much fun you can have, the wife said, wow, that sounds like fun.

123
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:04,899
Okay.

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,199
So sounds like fun.

125
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
It's not actually a sound.

126
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:14,600
This phrase is really important because we say it a lot, but it actually just means that it sounds like it will be a fun time.

127
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:15,040
Right.

128
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,160
Or I think it will be fun.

129
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:16,819
Yeah.

130
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,720
So from what you're telling me, I think it's fun.

131
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:20,620
That's right.

132
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,399
So we can say this about a lot of things.

133
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,160
I could say, hey, Marco, we're going to go play some football after work.

134
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:26,779
Do you want to come?

135
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,259
Sure.

136
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:28,379
That sounds like fun.

137
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,040
All right.

138
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,060
So he thinks it sounds like a good idea.

139
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,899
You'll probably come, right?

140
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:33,459
Exactly.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,519
So if something sounds like fun.

142
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,079
All right.

143
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,120
And moving on to our last phrase, we said that it was a great idea that we're going to the park and getting fresh air because we don't go to the gym anymore.

144
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:46,199
Okay.

145
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,160
Now this is a really important phrase to keep as a phrase.

146
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,639
First of all, we have a gym.

147
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,879
What do you do at a gym, Marco?

148
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,040
Well, you work out.

149
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,399
Yeah.

150
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,139
You exercise.

151
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,060
Maybe you run on the treadmill or you lift weights.

152
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:00,980
But it's important to remember that the verb here is to go to the gym.

153
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,459
So I could say, I go to the gym three times a week.

154
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,060
How often do you go to the gym?

155
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:06,579
Okay.

156
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:07,660
So that's the phrase.

157
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,220
You go to the gym.

158
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,759
I stop going to the gym and I gain a little weight.

159
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:12,759
Okay.

160
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,180
So that's the way you use it.

161
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,939
You don't use any other verb, but when you're talking about the gym, you say you go to the gym.

162
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,920
I go to the gym.

163
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,839
He goes to the gym regularly.

164
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:21,839
Alright.

165
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:22,959
Very good.

166
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,860
So that's all the Fluency Builder for today.

167
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,240
Let's review our dialogue one last time.

168
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,159
Hey, honey.

169
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,100
Where were you?

170
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,019
I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air.

171
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,159
How was it?

172
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,299
Were there a lot of kids?

173
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
It wasn't too crowded, but we had a great time.

174
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:49,340
We got on the seesaw together, then went on a couple of different slides, and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym, but I didn't fit.

175
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,620
Sounds like fun.

176
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,840
When we go, he always just likes to play in the sandbox.

177
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:55,960
Yeah, but today he was really hyper.

178
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,919
He even got under the monkey bars.

179
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,700
And then he went on to go on the swings for half an hour.

180
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm exhausted.

181
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,080
You should go to the park more often, since you don't go to the gym anymore.

182
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:15,539
Alright, so growing up, there are many, many different games at parks that you can probably find, especially now.

183
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,820
You have such great playground equipment, but I think these are the most basic ones that everyone knows about.

184
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:21,580
That's right.

185
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:25,860
These are pretty standard things that you'll see at a playground.

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,720
I remember that a park doesn't have to have these things.

187
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,539
Parks are just public places, maybe with benches and trees.

188
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:40,019
But a playground is the part of the park where you'll see these kinds of things, like a slide or swings.

189
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,779
And so, it's important to remember that they're not the same.

190
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,539
Right, right.

191
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:50,639
And now, did you ever have a bad accident, or did you fall off the swing, or the seesaw, or maybe you fell off the slide?

192
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,899
Oh, I fell all the time.

193
00:09:51,980 --> 00:10:00,399
Never a serious accident, but swings, I liked to swing, and when I was forward, you know, up in the air, I used to let go and jump.

194
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,019
Uh-huh, you would jump off the swing.

195
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,659
I would jump off the swing, so when you're very high in the air, it feels like you're flying for a minute.

196
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,519
My mother hated it because she thought I was going to break my arms, but I loved it.

197
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:19,299
It's great fun, and actually, we would really like to know, maybe you have some pictures that you can share with us of some specific playground equipment that we may have missed.

198
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,759
There are a lot of things out there, and maybe locally there are even some more fun things that we don't have.

199
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:27,659
So let us know, what do playgrounds look like in your country?

200
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,080
We hope to see you at EnglishPod.com.

201
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,059
Alright, we'll see you guys there.

202
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:31,419
Bye.
