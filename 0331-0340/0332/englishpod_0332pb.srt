00:00:01,119 --> 00:00:03,419
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:10,140
My name is Catherine, and today we're going to be helping you set up an answering machine, basically.

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:10,980
That's right.

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,140
So somebody's calling you, you can't answer the phone, so you leave a message.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,199
And we're going to teach you all about that today.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:17,800
That's right.

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,399
So let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to figure out just what's going on.

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,019
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:35,539
I just got the service, and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,320
Sure.

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:42,619
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,020
Okay, so I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

14
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,880
I will call you later, so leave me your name and number.

15
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:52,420
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,759
Okay, so how about this?

17
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,600
This is Abby, and I'm really happy you called.

18
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,619
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

19
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,920
Talk to you soon.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,340
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

21
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,420
Just say this.

22
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,140
Hi, you've reached Abby.

23
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,280
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

24
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:14,819
Thanks.

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,219
That's perfect.

26
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:19,319
Can you say that again and record it for me?

27
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some language takeaway.

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,280
Alright, in the first sentence, we are asking someone to help me set up my voicemail message.

29
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,540
So we got two key words there.

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,079
That's right, so let's break it up.

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,760
The first one is a phrasal verb, to set up, okay?

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,959
You can set a lot of things up, but just remember that set and up, these are the two words that go together.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,659
In this case, we're setting up voicemail.

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,019
It means to establish or to start or to put together.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,159
Yeah, to install.

36
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:05,599
Like, for example, you get a new computer and you have to connect all the cables and you have to connect the monitor, so you say, can you help me set up my computer?

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,259
That's right, so he always helps me set it up, so my computer, for example.

38
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,340
That's right, and what we're setting up is our voicemail message, so what exactly is voicemail?

39
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,680
Well, you know what mail is, we have email and regular mail.

40
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:28,319
Voicemail is the kind of message you receive on your phone, your cell phone, or your home phone when you don't answer the phone.

41
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,599
That's right, so basically a way for people to leave you a message even though you can't answer them.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,759
That's right, so this is something that's, it's not text, it's actually a voice, so that's why it's called voicemail, and you have to set it up, okay, so there's no automatic voicemail message, you actually have to make your own, or you can choose one, and today we're making our own.

43
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:58,159
That's right, and so we're explaining that we actually just got this service, and we don't really know what we're supposed to say or how to set up our voicemail.

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:05,319
That's right, so voicemail messages are a kind of service, and now who would offer this kind of service, Marco?

45
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,599
Probably your telephone company.

46
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:20,819
That's right, so a telephone company will offer many different services, and these are things that you can pay extra for, and they're useful, they can help you in some way, so another kind of service is three-way calling, right?

47
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:27,780
That's right, so actually we're taking a look at this word service as a noun, so we have a service, or this service.

48
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:31,039
So the company offers this service.

49
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,280
And well, why are we setting up the voicemail?

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,719
And our friend explains that we're just basically doing it to let the caller know who they called.

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:52,300
Okay, so if I call a number, and it says, hey, leave a message, I don't know who I'm leaving a message for, did I dial the wrong number, what do I say, do I say my phone number?

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,419
So this is basically instructions for what to say.

53
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,500
That's right, and you become the caller, right?

54
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:13,979
So whoever is making the call is called the caller, and this is why we are setting up our voicemail to let the caller know who we are calling, and of course, we have to ask the caller for their contact information.

55
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:26,860
Alright, now this is important because it's not just something you have with voicemail messages, you have contact information for many different things, for example, your medical care, your school, you have to include contact information.

56
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,019
Now this would be your phone number, your address, and or your email.

57
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:31,899
That's right.

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:44,300
So your contact information is not only useful for in a voicemail message, but for example, in a business meeting or a business lunch, you want to get maybe someone else's contact information so you can call them later.

59
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:44,860
That's right.

60
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,180
So don't forget, it's also your name as well, so I forgot to mention that.

61
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,639
That's right, your contact information must have your name.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,139
Alright, so that's pretty much all we have for the first part of language takeaway.

63
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,079
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,399
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

65
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,759
Okay, so how about this?

66
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,579
This is Abby, and I'm really happy you called.

67
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,579
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

68
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:41,879
Talk to you soon!

69
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,319
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

70
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,420
Just say this.

71
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,100
Hi, you've reached Abby.

72
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:52,779
Thanks.

74
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:54,180
That's perfect.

75
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,180
Can you say that again and record it for me?

76
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,079
Alright, here we are in Fluency Builder, and the first phrase we've got is, How about this?

77
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,360
So, we're saying, we've got an example for you.

78
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,379
How about this?

79
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,160
That's right.

80
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,100
Then the example.

81
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:23,139
So we've talked about, we've talked about how about many times already, so for example, you know, how about we go to the movies, or how not to say how about you're weak, and because that's completely wrong.

82
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:28,139
In this occasion, we're talking about how about this, and this is like setting it up for an example.

83
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:36,439
That's right, so for another example, we could say, so Marco, I'm trying to figure out how to say hello when I answer the phone, because I don't like the way I say it now.

84
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:37,980
So I could say, how about this?

85
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,040
Hello?

86
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,240
Is that good?

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,560
No?

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,620
Yeah, that's alright, that's right.

89
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello!

90
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,240
No, that's too strong.

91
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,360
Hello?

92
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:46,439
Yeah, that's good.

93
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,800
Alright, so basically, I'm setting up an example.

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,180
Right.

95
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,740
I'm saying, okay, so keep listening, I will give you an example.

96
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,120
Yeah, just imagine that you're trying on different clothes, and someone is giving you their opinion.

97
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,680
So maybe you try on a black shirt, and you say, how about this one?

98
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:03,720
Eh, boring.

99
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,480
And then you try on a green one, and you say, now how about this?

100
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:06,959
Better.

101
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:07,600
Right?

102
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,540
So then you're giving them other options and examples, and this is why we say, how about this?

103
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,899
And then we give the example, like Abby did.

104
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,319
And you're also asking for a response.

105
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,240
You're asking for an opinion.

106
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,699
And so what Abby's saying is, I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.

107
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:37,839
Now this phrase, give you a ring, is very British English, but it's also something you should know if you want to be in America, because you'll hear it in TV and stuff.

108
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:45,060
That's right, it's actually a colloquial term for saying, I will call you, I will call you, I will call you back, or I will give you a call.

109
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,860
So the telephone rings.

110
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,300
That's the verb that goes with a phone, right?

111
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:50,060
Ring ring.

112
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,819
So I will give you a ring means I will call you, just like you just said, Marco.

113
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,540
That's right.

114
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,879
So remember this phrase, it's actually, it may seem a little bit confusing, but remember it has to do with calling someone.

115
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,420
I will give you a ring is I will call you.

116
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:09,000
Or if you say, hey, give me a ring later on this afternoon, it means call me later this afternoon.

117
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:15,879
Alright, and then moving towards the end of the dialogue, Abby says, hi, you have reached Abby.

118
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,279
Okay, this is weird, because she is Abby.

119
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,560
But she's saying you have reached Abby, right, you're speaking about yourself in the third person.

120
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right.

121
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,000
So this is a message.

122
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,160
So you're telling people what to do, like I said, their instructions.

123
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,759
And so this is basically the first thing you say you have reached Catherine.

124
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,940
That means the number you dialed is Catherine's phone number, right?

125
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,460
So you reached that means that you've contacted, right?

126
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,100
Exactly.

127
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:58,059
So as you said, it's important if you ever call a bank, or in or any type of company, it will say, you have reached Wells Fargo bank or something, and it'll give you it'll tell you what number you call because maybe you put in your finger wrong and you just call the wrong number.

128
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,500
That's right.

129
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,379
Or you could use the word reached in a different way.

130
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,100
For example, yesterday, I was very angry at Marco because I couldn't reach him by phone.

131
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,759
I called and called and called and couldn't reach him.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,759
And I realized then his phone is broken.

133
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:09,759
That's right.

134
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,440
So actually, this verb to reach someone also has to do with with in general with calling.

135
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,519
I was trying to reach you all afternoon, but I couldn't get a hold of you.

136
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,100
That's right.

137
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,419
And I was so frustrated.

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:29,659
Well, actually, if I had voicemail, I would continue by saying I am unable to answer your call right now because maybe my phone is off.

139
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,779
Maybe I am busy.

140
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:35,220
So we say I am unable to answer your call right now.

141
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:35,500
All right.

142
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:44,419
Now, this seems really long, OK, and a little bit strange, but this is basically the standard for how to record a message.

143
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:46,639
I am unable to answer your call right now.

144
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,240
So you answer the phone, right?

145
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,980
Or you answer a phone call.

146
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,919
But in this case, I'm unable to.

147
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,440
That means I can't talk to you for whatever reason.

148
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,519
I'm out of the house.

149
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,179
I'm busy.

150
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,340
So I'm unable to answer your call right now.

151
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,779
Just remember that that means I can't talk to you right now, can't be on the phone.

152
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:10,220
And actually, this word unable sounds a lot more polite and a lot more formal than saying I can't.

153
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:10,879
That's right.

154
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,100
And that's why we use it on messages like this, because it is so polite and so nice.

155
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,720
That's right.

156
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:16,620
All right.

157
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,519
So that's all the time we have for Fluency Builder.

158
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,139
Let's take a listen to our dialogue one last time.

159
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,860
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

160
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,379
I just got the service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

161
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,399
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

162
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,840
Okay, so I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

163
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,720
I will call you later, so leave me your name and number.

164
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,220
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

165
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,600
Okay, so how about this?

166
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,460
This is Abby and I'm really happy you called.

167
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,440
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

168
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,779
Talk to you soon.

169
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,139
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

170
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,259
Just say this.

171
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,940
Hi, you've reached Abby.

172
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:13,080
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

173
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:13,639
Thanks.

174
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,019
That's perfect.

175
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,820
Can you say that again and record it for me?

176
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:29,379
All right, so talking about voicemail, I think in the United States, this is a very, very popular and almost necessary service.

177
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,360
That's right.

178
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:47,860
So in America, if you buy a phone plan, which most people have, that means that you can use your phone in a certain way, like every day you have free nights or you have a thousand minutes per month to talk, but you sometimes also get these services or you pay extra for them.

179
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,120
And voicemail is very important because people don't text as much in America as they do in other countries.

180
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,139
And so I know in other places, sometimes you text a message to someone and they receive it and okay, it's a message.

181
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,240
But if you don't do that, you actually have to record a message.

182
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,480
Like when I call my parents, they never answer the phone.

183
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,059
So I always have to leave a voicemail message.

184
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,600
So I say, hi, it's Catherine.

185
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,480
It's Saturday.

186
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,440
Where are you?

187
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:13,200
Call me.

188
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,279
Okay.

189
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:20,220
So that's that kind of, I think, cultural behavior that we just expect to leave messages for people in America.

190
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:31,440
And it's actually interesting because I've been to other countries where they also have voicemail messages and the service, but people are not as willing to actually leave the message.

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,480
So it happened to me, for example, I call someone, I get their voicemail and I don't leave a message.

192
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,580
I just hang up.

193
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,700
And then they have...

194
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,019
You're bored or you're uncomfortable?

195
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,100
I don't know.

196
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:48,659
Because, you know, if you have a mobile phone, it'll show up anyways that you have a missed call from this person.

197
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,580
So then I really just, I don't really leave the message anymore.

198
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,279
It's like, okay, you saw that I called you.

199
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,039
Either I'll just call you back later or you'll call me back when you see the missed call.

200
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,940
But yeah, for homes, obviously it's different.

201
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,779
You need to leave a message if you call someone.

202
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,820
Although sometimes it can be a bad thing.

203
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,779
I definitely have a friend who loves to leave long messages.

204
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:12,580
Oh, really?

205
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:13,919
Hey, Catherine, it's me.

206
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,399
So it's like Saturday at four o'clock and I was just thinking about calling and I was going to come over but I decided not to come over.

207
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,240
But then I was thinking maybe I'll just call you instead and I can see that you're not home.

208
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,620
But maybe you're out to dinner.

209
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,500
I remember you sang.

210
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,860
And they just go on and on and on.

211
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:29,419
You actually, there is an end.

212
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,679
They'll go beep and then it cuts you off.

213
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:31,860
Right.

214
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,000
I think it's like 30 seconds or something like this.

215
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,299
So it's very interesting, this whole voicemail thing, especially in the business world as well.

216
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,100
Many times people go into a meeting, turn off their phones or put it on silent.

217
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,720
And you know, if you want to reach them or you want to leave a message, you've got to do the voicemail.

218
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,820
Yeah, calls will go right to voicemail so that you don't interrupt the meeting.

219
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:50,460
Exactly.

220
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,039
