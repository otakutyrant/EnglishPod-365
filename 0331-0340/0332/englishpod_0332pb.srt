00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're going to be helping you set up an answering machine, basically.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So somebody's calling you, you can't answer the phone, so you leave a message.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And we're going to teach you all about that today.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to figure out just what's going on.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I just got the service, and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sure.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, so I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will call you later, so leave me your name and number.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, so how about this?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is Abby, and I'm really happy you called.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Talk to you soon.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Just say this.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hi, you've reached Abby.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thanks.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's perfect.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Can you say that again and record it for me?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some language takeaway.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Alright, in the first sentence, we are asking someone to help me set up my voicemail message.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So we got two key words there.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right, so let's break it up.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The first one is a phrasal verb, to set up, okay?

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can set a lot of things up, but just remember that set and up, these are the two words that go together.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In this case, we're setting up voicemail.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It means to establish or to start or to put together.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, to install.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Like, for example, you get a new computer and you have to connect all the cables and you have to connect the monitor, so you say, can you help me set up my computer?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right, so he always helps me set it up, so my computer, for example.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right, and what we're setting up is our voicemail message, so what exactly is voicemail?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, you know what mail is, we have email and regular mail.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Voicemail is the kind of message you receive on your phone, your cell phone, or your home phone when you don't answer the phone.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right, so basically a way for people to leave you a message even though you can't answer them.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's right, so this is something that's, it's not text, it's actually a voice, so that's why it's called voicemail, and you have to set it up, okay, so there's no automatic voicemail message, you actually have to make your own, or you can choose one, and today we're making our own.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right, and so we're explaining that we actually just got this service, and we don't really know what we're supposed to say or how to set up our voicemail.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right, so voicemail messages are a kind of service, and now who would offer this kind of service, Marco?

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Probably your telephone company.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right, so a telephone company will offer many different services, and these are things that you can pay extra for, and they're useful, they can help you in some way, so another kind of service is three-way calling, right?

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right, so actually we're taking a look at this word service as a noun, so we have a service, or this service.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So the company offers this service.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And well, why are we setting up the voicemail?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And our friend explains that we're just basically doing it to let the caller know who they called.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, so if I call a number, and it says, hey, leave a message, I don't know who I'm leaving a message for, did I dial the wrong number, what do I say, do I say my phone number?

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So this is basically instructions for what to say.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right, and you become the caller, right?

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So whoever is making the call is called the caller, and this is why we are setting up our voicemail to let the caller know who we are calling, and of course, we have to ask the caller for their contact information.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Alright, now this is important because it's not just something you have with voicemail messages, you have contact information for many different things, for example, your medical care, your school, you have to include contact information.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now this would be your phone number, your address, and or your email.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's right.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So your contact information is not only useful for in a voicemail message, but for example, in a business meeting or a business lunch, you want to get maybe someone else's contact information so you can call them later.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So don't forget, it's also your name as well, so I forgot to mention that.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right, your contact information must have your name.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Alright, so that's pretty much all we have for the first part of language takeaway.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, so how about this?

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is Abby, and I'm really happy you called.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Talk to you soon!

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just say this.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hi, you've reached Abby.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thanks.

74
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's perfect.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Can you say that again and record it for me?

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Alright, here we are in Fluency Builder, and the first phrase we've got is, How about this?

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So, we're saying, we've got an example for you.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How about this?

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That's right.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then the example.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So we've talked about, we've talked about how about many times already, so for example, you know, how about we go to the movies, or how not to say how about you're weak, and because that's completely wrong.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In this occasion, we're talking about how about this, and this is like setting it up for an example.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's right, so for another example, we could say, so Marco, I'm trying to figure out how to say hello when I answer the phone, because I don't like the way I say it now.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So I could say, how about this?

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hello?

86
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Is that good?

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No?

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, that's alright, that's right.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello!

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, that's too strong.

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hello?

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, that's good.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Alright, so basically, I'm setting up an example.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm saying, okay, so keep listening, I will give you an example.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, just imagine that you're trying on different clothes, and someone is giving you their opinion.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So maybe you try on a black shirt, and you say, how about this one?

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Eh, boring.

99
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And then you try on a green one, and you say, now how about this?

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Better.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right?

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So then you're giving them other options and examples, and this is why we say, how about this?

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And then we give the example, like Abby did.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And you're also asking for a response.

105
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're asking for an opinion.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And so what Abby's saying is, I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Now this phrase, give you a ring, is very British English, but it's also something you should know if you want to be in America, because you'll hear it in TV and stuff.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's right, it's actually a colloquial term for saying, I will call you, I will call you, I will call you back, or I will give you a call.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So the telephone rings.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's the verb that goes with a phone, right?

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ring ring.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So I will give you a ring means I will call you, just like you just said, Marco.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's right.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So remember this phrase, it's actually, it may seem a little bit confusing, but remember it has to do with calling someone.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I will give you a ring is I will call you.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Or if you say, hey, give me a ring later on this afternoon, it means call me later this afternoon.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Alright, and then moving towards the end of the dialogue, Abby says, hi, you have reached Abby.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, this is weird, because she is Abby.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But she's saying you have reached Abby, right, you're speaking about yourself in the third person.

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So this is a message.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So you're telling people what to do, like I said, their instructions.

123
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And so this is basically the first thing you say you have reached Catherine.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That means the number you dialed is Catherine's phone number, right?

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you reached that means that you've contacted, right?

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Exactly.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So as you said, it's important if you ever call a bank, or in or any type of company, it will say, you have reached Wells Fargo bank or something, and it'll give you it'll tell you what number you call because maybe you put in your finger wrong and you just call the wrong number.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Or you could use the word reached in a different way.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
For example, yesterday, I was very angry at Marco because I couldn't reach him by phone.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I called and called and called and couldn't reach him.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I realized then his phone is broken.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So actually, this verb to reach someone also has to do with with in general with calling.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was trying to reach you all afternoon, but I couldn't get a hold of you.

136
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And I was so frustrated.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, actually, if I had voicemail, I would continue by saying I am unable to answer your call right now because maybe my phone is off.

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Maybe I am busy.

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So we say I am unable to answer your call right now.

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now, this seems really long, OK, and a little bit strange, but this is basically the standard for how to record a message.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I am unable to answer your call right now.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So you answer the phone, right?

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Or you answer a phone call.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But in this case, I'm unable to.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That means I can't talk to you for whatever reason.

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm out of the house.

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm busy.

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So I'm unable to answer your call right now.

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Just remember that that means I can't talk to you right now, can't be on the phone.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And actually, this word unable sounds a lot more polite and a lot more formal than saying I can't.

153
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And that's why we use it on messages like this, because it is so polite and so nice.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's right.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All right.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So that's all the time we have for Fluency Builder.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue one last time.

159
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

160
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I just got the service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, so I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I will call you later, so leave me your name and number.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, so how about this?

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is Abby and I'm really happy you called.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

168
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Talk to you soon.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Just say this.

171
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hi, you've reached Abby.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thanks.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's perfect.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Can you say that again and record it for me?

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right, so talking about voicemail, I think in the United States, this is a very, very popular and almost necessary service.

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So in America, if you buy a phone plan, which most people have, that means that you can use your phone in a certain way, like every day you have free nights or you have a thousand minutes per month to talk, but you sometimes also get these services or you pay extra for them.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And voicemail is very important because people don't text as much in America as they do in other countries.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And so I know in other places, sometimes you text a message to someone and they receive it and okay, it's a message.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But if you don't do that, you actually have to record a message.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Like when I call my parents, they never answer the phone.

183
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So I always have to leave a voicemail message.

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So I say, hi, it's Catherine.

185
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's Saturday.

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where are you?

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Call me.

188
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So that's that kind of, I think, cultural behavior that we just expect to leave messages for people in America.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And it's actually interesting because I've been to other countries where they also have voicemail messages and the service, but people are not as willing to actually leave the message.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
So it happened to me, for example, I call someone, I get their voicemail and I don't leave a message.

192
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I just hang up.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then they have...

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're bored or you're uncomfortable?

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know.

196
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Because, you know, if you have a mobile phone, it'll show up anyways that you have a missed call from this person.

197
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So then I really just, I don't really leave the message anymore.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's like, okay, you saw that I called you.

199
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Either I'll just call you back later or you'll call me back when you see the missed call.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But yeah, for homes, obviously it's different.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You need to leave a message if you call someone.

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Although sometimes it can be a bad thing.

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I definitely have a friend who loves to leave long messages.

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh, really?

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey, Catherine, it's me.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So it's like Saturday at four o'clock and I was just thinking about calling and I was going to come over but I decided not to come over.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But then I was thinking maybe I'll just call you instead and I can see that you're not home.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But maybe you're out to dinner.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I remember you sang.

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And they just go on and on and on.

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You actually, there is an end.

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They'll go beep and then it cuts you off.

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Right.

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I think it's like 30 seconds or something like this.

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So it's very interesting, this whole voicemail thing, especially in the business world as well.

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Many times people go into a meeting, turn off their phones or put it on silent.

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And you know, if you want to reach them or you want to leave a message, you've got to do the voicemail.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, calls will go right to voicemail so that you don't interrupt the meeting.

219
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Exactly.

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
