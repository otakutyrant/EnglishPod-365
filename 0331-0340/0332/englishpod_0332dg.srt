1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,019
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,580
I just got the service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,339
Sure.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,640
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,039
Okay, so I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,940
I will call you later, so leave me your name and number.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,460
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

8
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,820
Okay, so how about this?

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,640
This is Abby, and I'm really happy you called.

10
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:40,659
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:41,960
Talk to you soon!

12
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:44,380
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,460
Just say this.

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,159
Hi, you've reached Abby.

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:52,299
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

16
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:52,859
Thanks.

17
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,240
That's perfect.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,240
Can you say that again and record it for me?
