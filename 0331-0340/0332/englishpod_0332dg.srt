1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Can you help me set up my voicemail message?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I just got the service and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sure.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You just basically got to let the caller know who they called and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, so I can say, this is Abby's voicemail.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I will call you later, so leave me your name and number.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, so how about this?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is Abby, and I'm really happy you called.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Talk to you soon!

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Uh, a little too friendly, Abby.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Just say this.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hi, you've reached Abby.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thanks.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's perfect.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Can you say that again and record it for me?
