00:00:01,179 --> 00:00:03,339
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:04,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,219
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:14,759
And today we're talking about an uncomfortable subject, not because it's uncomfortable to talk about, but because it's well, it doesn't really feel good when you have to go do it.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,460
That's right.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,600
Today we're going to the doctor, but because we need to get vaccines.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,320
All right.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,780
So vaccines, these are, well, let's listen out during the dialogue and maybe you can guess what this word means.

9
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,619
When we come back, we'll be defining it for you, talking about different kinds of vaccines.

10
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,460
But just remember that we're talking about going to the doctor to get these shots.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,179
So let's take a listen to that dialogue.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,340
Hello Mrs.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:46,679
Parker.

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,479
How have you been?

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,219
Hello, Dr.

16
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,560
Peters.

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,600
Just fine.

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,200
Thank you.

19
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,299
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:53,280
Very well.

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,039
Let's see.

22
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,520
According to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B shots.

23
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,500
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox, and measles shots.

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
What about rubella and mumps?

25
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,659
Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks, I can administer the rest.

26
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,640
Okay, great.

27
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:19,239
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

28
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:22,400
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
But we'll check our records, and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,739
Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight.

31
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:30,120
This may sting a little.

32
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:33,760
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,840
So now let's take a look at all of these words that are a little bit difficult, but we'll try to define them on language takeaway.

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,900
Language takeaway.

35
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,640
So Marco, first off, what is a vaccine?

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:02:02,319
So a vaccine we can say is a type of medicine, but it's basically an injection or medicine where you're helping a person defend him or herself against a specific type of disease.

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,979
Okay, so vaccination is medicine you receive before you're sick so that in the future, you won't get sick with that disease.

38
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,759
That's right, that's right.

39
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,860
So that's a vaccine.

40
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:20,620
There are many, many different types of vaccines, and of course, when you do get them, you need to keep track of them via a vaccination record.

41
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:26,060
So a record is basically a list or a document that shows what has been done.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:33,219
And this is very important when you go to the doctor to have a record of the things that you have received, the vaccines you've received.

43
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:41,439
So for example, if I have a baby and I want the baby to have vaccinations, we'd have to keep a record of all of his vaccinations.

44
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,199
That's right.

45
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,479
So we are obviously we get different vaccines at different stages in our life.

46
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,319
Let's talk about some of the ones that we're taking a look at today.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,659
So for example, we have a tetanus vaccine or a tetanus shot.

48
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:54,319
All right.

49
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,979
The tetanus shot is very famous because it's maybe the most painful.

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,300
It really makes you sore for a little while.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,199
And most people get the tetanus shot when they're very young.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,620
This prevents you from getting the disease tetanus.

53
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:15,080
And tetanus is something you can get from animals or from dirty nails, dirty metal, anything that pokes out at you.

54
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,860
And so you get the tetanus shot, but then after your tetanus shot every five or 10 years, you need to get a booster shot.

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,919
So there's the tetanus shot and there's the tetanus booster.

56
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,460
So when we talk about a booster, when we're talking about vaccines is basically you are reinforcing it.

57
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,520
You are making it stronger because obviously over time it becomes weak.

58
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,240
The medicine won't last forever.

59
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,060
So you need to get a booster to make sure that you are still protected.

60
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:42,620
Basically it's an update.

61
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:43,120
That's right.

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,479
So we have tetanus and tetanus booster, but we have another kind of vaccine.

63
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,159
The disease here is called hepatitis.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,319
That's right.

65
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,840
So we're taking a look at hepatitis B and hepatitis A.

66
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,740
So there are different types of hepatitis.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,680
That's right.

68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:14,080
So both kinds of hepatitis you can catch from other people, although hepatitis A, I believe you can catch from saliva or contact, whereas hepatitis B you catch from other people's blood or if you have a relationship with someone.

69
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,519
So hepatitis A and B are different.

70
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,240
Hepatitis B affects your liver and so there's different kinds of severity here.

71
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,540
Now hepatitis A and B there are vaccinations for.

72
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:32,459
You can get those shots and it's very important if you're traveling to places that require them so that you don't get sick.

73
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,139
So, well, these different types of hepatitis, they are dangerous, right, and they could be fatal.

74
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,720
But another one that's very, very common, especially with young kids, we have chicken pox.

75
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
Chicken pox.

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,139
Now it's kind of a funny name, chicken pox, P-O-X.

77
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,779
But it's also, like you say, very common.

78
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,860
So basically the symptoms are what?

79
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,839
You get these red bumps all over your body and they itch.

80
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,240
You want to scratch and scratch and scratch.

81
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:08,339
And so I remember when I had this, I was a little kid, my mom said, don't scratch because if you scratch, it will leave a mark.

82
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:08,779
Right.

83
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:09,600
It leaves a scar.

84
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:14,300
So yeah, chicken pox, you get these little rashes all over your body.

85
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:18,620
They're very itchy, but they will go away with time.

86
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,259
Now it's usually, I've heard that it's recommended that people get it.

87
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:27,899
Actually, you should get it when you're young because it's more dangerous if you get it as an adult.

88
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:28,639
That's right.

89
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,220
It's very painful as an adult.

90
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:37,060
So basically chicken pox, they say if you get it once, you can't get it again.

91
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,879
Right, you'll never get it again.

92
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,079
But if you get it as an adult, it shingles.

93
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:40,980
It's very painful.

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,819
Okay, very good.

95
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,699
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here.

96
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,959
Why don't we now jump to another section.

97
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,879
Let's continue talking about these different types of vaccines.

98
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,100
Let's go to language takeaway part two.

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,500
All right.

100
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,279
So we have this special category of vaccinations.

101
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,759
They usually go together.

102
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:07,860
We have mumps, measles, and rubella, or there's a special acronym, MMR, mumps, measles, rubella.

103
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,680
Rubella.

104
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:13,319
So you basically get like a little combo, usually get all three of them at one go.

105
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,740
So what are these measles?

106
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:18,860
All right, measles, well measles is a virus.

107
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,220
He's got the measles.

108
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,759
You often read books from like the 19th century where everyone gets the measles when they're a child.

109
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,680
But measles is basically a virus, but it's kind of like the chicken pox because you get a rash on your skin.

110
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,819
And is it fatal?

111
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,420
Can you die from the measles?

112
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,040
I think in the old days you could, but these days it's pretty easy to take care of.

113
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:41,779
And what about mumps?

114
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:51,319
Now mumps, I'm not too sure about this, but I've heard that mumps is like a swelling in the space between your jaw and your ear.

115
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,680
So you know where your ear kind of comes down to your jaw.

116
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,680
That part of your head starts to swell and is very uncomfortable.

117
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:02,740
And it could cause, like the consequences could be fatal, right?

118
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,139
That's right.

119
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,620
And what about rubella?

120
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,040
Rubella is another kind of rash.

121
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,879
And from my reading, I saw that rubella is not very dangerous for most people, but it is very dangerous for pregnant women.

122
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:31,839
So most pregnant women are tested for rubella or the rubella vaccine, and they're told to get the vaccine before they're pregnant so that they don't get this disease and harm their baby because they can have a miscarriage if they get rubella while they're pregnant.

123
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,339
Right.

124
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:32,660
Right.

125
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:33,540
Okay.

126
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,500
So pretty much you want to get all these vaccines to make sure that you don't get sick in the future.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,279
Now, when we were talking about getting the vaccines, the doctor said, he didn't say you're going to get the vaccines or I'm going to give you a vaccine.

128
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,819
He said, I'll have the nurse administer the vaccine or administer the booster.

129
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,560
That's right.

130
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,439
So the verb here that we use with vaccine is to administer.

131
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,459
And this is something that the nurse does or the doctor does.

132
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:06,959
And it's just a way to say that the nurse will give you this shot, to give you a shot.

133
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,939
But administer is more formal, it's more common in the medical kind of medical talk.

134
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,480
So you'd say administer the test or administer the vaccine.

135
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:21,980
So for example, a doctor would say, I'm going to administer a shot of penicillin.

136
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,540
That's right.

137
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:25,060
Or I'm going to administer this blood test.

138
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,519
That means I'm actually going to do it right now.

139
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,840
Now obviously, these vaccines, some of them you can take as a little pill.

140
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:37,919
Some of them you can take as drops, like, you know, it's very painless.

141
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,919
But some of them you have to get a shot and sometimes they do hurt.

142
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,879
And we saw in the dialogue that the doctor said this may sting a little.

143
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,500
Doctors always say this before they give you a shot.

144
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,320
This may sting a little.

145
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,460
Now sting is a verb that means to hurt.

146
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,980
But it's not like I hit you in the face, boom, it stings.

147
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,139
No, a sting is like a kind of a very kind of light hurt.

148
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,759
It's like a pinch.

149
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,220
It stings.

150
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,860
It's like a small sharp pain.

151
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,860
Small sharp pain.

152
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,960
That's a good way to describe it.

153
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,500
So oftentimes we talk about bees, you know, bees that fly around.

154
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,580
They sting you.

155
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,019
Right.

156
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,320
Right.

157
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,720
So it's a small sharp pain.

158
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,059
Right.

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,960
Okay.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,519
Very good.

161
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,740
So let's listen to the dialogue again.

162
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,340
Let's keep a lookout for how we pronounce all of these words and we'll be back in a bit.

163
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:27,980
Hello, Mrs.

164
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:28,320
Parker.

165
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,100
How have you been?

166
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,860
Hello, Dr.

167
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:30,279
Peters.

168
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,259
Just fine.

169
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,840
Thank you.

170
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,960
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

171
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,919
Very well.

172
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,679
Let's see.

173
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:42,159
According to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B shots.

174
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,100
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox, and measles shots.

175
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,299
What about rubella and mumps?

176
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,279
Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks, I can administer the rest.

177
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,259
Okay, great.

178
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,879
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

179
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,039
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

180
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,039
Well, check our records and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

181
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:10,379
Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight.

182
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,840
This may sting a little.

183
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:19,440
So nowadays, most of these shots are administered when the babies are just born.

184
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,399
They're still in the hospital and they get a lot of vaccines to prevent them from getting these things.

185
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,799
That's right, and I remember when I was a kid, we didn't even have a vaccine for chicken pox, so these days there are more and more.

186
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:42,519
The oldest, I think, is the polio vaccine, the one that we hear the most about, because it was a very serious disease that affected a lot of people up until the 1940s and 50s, I believe.

187
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,740
So, yeah, it's important really to read about these things and to educate yourself so that you know what you should get yourself and your kids.

188
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,299
That's exactly right, because it's very important.

189
00:10:53,299 --> 00:11:00,899
Most of these diseases or most of these viruses have been eradicated because more and more people have had access to vaccines.

190
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:10,460
For example, polio, it's very rare, you would say, to actually get it nowadays because there's a vaccine, but it's very, very important, I think.

191
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,620
But some people get a little bit too nervous.

192
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:24,460
For example, whenever they travel to a tropical country, they're always afraid of yellow fever, so they get yellow fever shots, but I've never really seen anyone get yellow fever because you go to Thailand for a week.

193
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,340
A friend of mine went to Thailand and got dengue fever.

194
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,340
So there's no vaccination for this, but it is a very painful disease you can get in tropical places.

195
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:43,700
So I think the moral is talk to your doctor, see what he or she suggests, because they will understand maybe better than you will, and then just follow their advice for different places that you're traveling to.

196
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,379
That's right.

197
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:52,440

199
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,279
Bye.
