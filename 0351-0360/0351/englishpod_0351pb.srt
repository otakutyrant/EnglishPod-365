00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're talking about an uncomfortable subject, not because it's uncomfortable to talk about, but because it's well, it doesn't really feel good when you have to go do it.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we're going to the doctor, but because we need to get vaccines.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All right.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So vaccines, these are, well, let's listen out during the dialogue and maybe you can guess what this word means.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When we come back, we'll be defining it for you, talking about different kinds of vaccines.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But just remember that we're talking about going to the doctor to get these shots.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's take a listen to that dialogue.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello Mrs.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Parker.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How have you been?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello, Dr.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Peters.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Just fine.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Very well.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's see.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
According to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B shots.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox, and measles shots.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What about rubella and mumps?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks, I can administer the rest.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay, great.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But we'll check our records, and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This may sting a little.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, we're back.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So now let's take a look at all of these words that are a little bit difficult, but we'll try to define them on language takeaway.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Language takeaway.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So Marco, first off, what is a vaccine?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So a vaccine we can say is a type of medicine, but it's basically an injection or medicine where you're helping a person defend him or herself against a specific type of disease.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, so vaccination is medicine you receive before you're sick so that in the future, you won't get sick with that disease.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right, that's right.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So that's a vaccine.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There are many, many different types of vaccines, and of course, when you do get them, you need to keep track of them via a vaccination record.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So a record is basically a list or a document that shows what has been done.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And this is very important when you go to the doctor to have a record of the things that you have received, the vaccines you've received.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So for example, if I have a baby and I want the baby to have vaccinations, we'd have to keep a record of all of his vaccinations.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So we are obviously we get different vaccines at different stages in our life.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's talk about some of the ones that we're taking a look at today.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So for example, we have a tetanus vaccine or a tetanus shot.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All right.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The tetanus shot is very famous because it's maybe the most painful.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It really makes you sore for a little while.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And most people get the tetanus shot when they're very young.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This prevents you from getting the disease tetanus.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And tetanus is something you can get from animals or from dirty nails, dirty metal, anything that pokes out at you.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And so you get the tetanus shot, but then after your tetanus shot every five or 10 years, you need to get a booster shot.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So there's the tetanus shot and there's the tetanus booster.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So when we talk about a booster, when we're talking about vaccines is basically you are reinforcing it.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are making it stronger because obviously over time it becomes weak.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The medicine won't last forever.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you need to get a booster to make sure that you are still protected.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Basically it's an update.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So we have tetanus and tetanus booster, but we have another kind of vaccine.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The disease here is called hepatitis.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So we're taking a look at hepatitis B and hepatitis A.

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So there are different types of hepatitis.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So both kinds of hepatitis you can catch from other people, although hepatitis A, I believe you can catch from saliva or contact, whereas hepatitis B you catch from other people's blood or if you have a relationship with someone.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So hepatitis A and B are different.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hepatitis B affects your liver and so there's different kinds of severity here.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Now hepatitis A and B there are vaccinations for.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You can get those shots and it's very important if you're traveling to places that require them so that you don't get sick.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, well, these different types of hepatitis, they are dangerous, right, and they could be fatal.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But another one that's very, very common, especially with young kids, we have chicken pox.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Chicken pox.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now it's kind of a funny name, chicken pox, P-O-X.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But it's also, like you say, very common.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So basically the symptoms are what?

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You get these red bumps all over your body and they itch.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You want to scratch and scratch and scratch.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And so I remember when I had this, I was a little kid, my mom said, don't scratch because if you scratch, it will leave a mark.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Right.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It leaves a scar.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So yeah, chicken pox, you get these little rashes all over your body.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They're very itchy, but they will go away with time.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now it's usually, I've heard that it's recommended that people get it.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Actually, you should get it when you're young because it's more dangerous if you get it as an adult.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's very painful as an adult.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So basically chicken pox, they say if you get it once, you can't get it again.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right, you'll never get it again.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if you get it as an adult, it shingles.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's very painful.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, very good.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab here.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why don't we now jump to another section.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's continue talking about these different types of vaccines.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go to language takeaway part two.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So we have this special category of vaccinations.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They usually go together.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We have mumps, measles, and rubella, or there's a special acronym, MMR, mumps, measles, rubella.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Rubella.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So you basically get like a little combo, usually get all three of them at one go.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So what are these measles?

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
All right, measles, well measles is a virus.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's got the measles.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You often read books from like the 19th century where everyone gets the measles when they're a child.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But measles is basically a virus, but it's kind of like the chicken pox because you get a rash on your skin.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And is it fatal?

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Can you die from the measles?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think in the old days you could, but these days it's pretty easy to take care of.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And what about mumps?

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now mumps, I'm not too sure about this, but I've heard that mumps is like a swelling in the space between your jaw and your ear.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you know where your ear kind of comes down to your jaw.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That part of your head starts to swell and is very uncomfortable.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And it could cause, like the consequences could be fatal, right?

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's right.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And what about rubella?

120
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Rubella is another kind of rash.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And from my reading, I saw that rubella is not very dangerous for most people, but it is very dangerous for pregnant women.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So most pregnant women are tested for rubella or the rubella vaccine, and they're told to get the vaccine before they're pregnant so that they don't get this disease and harm their baby because they can have a miscarriage if they get rubella while they're pregnant.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Right.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So pretty much you want to get all these vaccines to make sure that you don't get sick in the future.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, when we were talking about getting the vaccines, the doctor said, he didn't say you're going to get the vaccines or I'm going to give you a vaccine.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He said, I'll have the nurse administer the vaccine or administer the booster.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So the verb here that we use with vaccine is to administer.

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And this is something that the nurse does or the doctor does.

132
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And it's just a way to say that the nurse will give you this shot, to give you a shot.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But administer is more formal, it's more common in the medical kind of medical talk.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So you'd say administer the test or administer the vaccine.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So for example, a doctor would say, I'm going to administer a shot of penicillin.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Or I'm going to administer this blood test.

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That means I'm actually going to do it right now.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Now obviously, these vaccines, some of them you can take as a little pill.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Some of them you can take as drops, like, you know, it's very painless.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But some of them you have to get a shot and sometimes they do hurt.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And we saw in the dialogue that the doctor said this may sting a little.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Doctors always say this before they give you a shot.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This may sting a little.

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Now sting is a verb that means to hurt.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But it's not like I hit you in the face, boom, it stings.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, a sting is like a kind of a very kind of light hurt.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's like a pinch.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It stings.

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's like a small sharp pain.

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Small sharp pain.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's a good way to describe it.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So oftentimes we talk about bees, you know, bees that fly around.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They sting you.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So it's a small sharp pain.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Very good.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So let's listen to the dialogue again.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's keep a lookout for how we pronounce all of these words and we'll be back in a bit.

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hello, Mrs.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Parker.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
How have you been?

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hello, Dr.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Peters.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Just fine.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Very well.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's see.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
According to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B shots.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox, and measles shots.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What about rubella and mumps?

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks, I can administer the rest.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, great.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, check our records and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight.

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This may sting a little.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So nowadays, most of these shots are administered when the babies are just born.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
They're still in the hospital and they get a lot of vaccines to prevent them from getting these things.

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right, and I remember when I was a kid, we didn't even have a vaccine for chicken pox, so these days there are more and more.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The oldest, I think, is the polio vaccine, the one that we hear the most about, because it was a very serious disease that affected a lot of people up until the 1940s and 50s, I believe.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So, yeah, it's important really to read about these things and to educate yourself so that you know what you should get yourself and your kids.

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's exactly right, because it's very important.

189
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Most of these diseases or most of these viruses have been eradicated because more and more people have had access to vaccines.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:10,000
For example, polio, it's very rare, you would say, to actually get it nowadays because there's a vaccine, but it's very, very important, I think.

191
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But some people get a little bit too nervous.

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:24,000
For example, whenever they travel to a tropical country, they're always afraid of yellow fever, so they get yellow fever shots, but I've never really seen anyone get yellow fever because you go to Thailand for a week.

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
A friend of mine went to Thailand and got dengue fever.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So there's no vaccination for this, but it is a very painful disease you can get in tropical places.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So I think the moral is talk to your doctor, see what he or she suggests, because they will understand maybe better than you will, and then just follow their advice for different places that you're traveling to.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's right.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Bye.
