EnglishPod.com Hello Mrs.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Parker, how have you been?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello Dr.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Peters.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Just fine, thank you.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Very well.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B shots.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox, and measles shots.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What about rubella and mumps?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, great.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We'll check our records, and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This may sting a little.
