EnglishPod.com Hello Mrs.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,699
Parker, how have you been?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,439
Hello Dr.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:09,880
Peters.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,539
Just fine, thank you.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,519
Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,500
Very well.

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,719
Let's see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his polio, tetanus, and hepatitis B shots.

9
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:27,660
He is 14 months old, so he is due for hepatitis A, chicken pox, and measles shots.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,940
What about rubella and mumps?

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,859
Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,880
Okay, great.

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,460
Doctor, I think I also may need a tetanus booster.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,619
Last time I got it was maybe 15 years ago.

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,619
We'll check our records, and I'll have the nurse administer the booster as well.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,979
Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,320
This may sting a little.
