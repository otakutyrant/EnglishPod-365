00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com I got an urgent email from Tom.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That sounds really dodgy to me.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No way.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tom is an honest person.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He wouldn't lie to me.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, I mean it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I mean think about it.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For sure.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.
