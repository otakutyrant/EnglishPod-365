00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,839
EnglishPod.com I got an urgent email from Tom.

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,539
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:12,300
What?

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,679
That sounds really dodgy to me.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,480
No way.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,820
Tom is an honest person.

7
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,679
He wouldn't lie to me.

8
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:22,179
No, I mean it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,539
I mean think about it.

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,760
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,820
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,620
For sure.

13
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:32,700
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.
