00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about something that is, well, not so fun when it happens.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we're going to talk about those situations where people are trying to take advantage of us.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
All right.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They're lying to us so they can take our money.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and when we come back in a moment, we'll be talking about some of these words and phrases that you're about to hear.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I got an urgent email from Tom.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That sounds really dodgy to me.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No way.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tom is an honest person.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He wouldn't lie to me.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I mean, think about it.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For sure.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Language Takeaway.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In Language Takeaway, Marco, one of the first things we hear is that I got an urgent email from Tom.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So this is an adjective, something that is urgent.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's urgent.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That means it needs to be looked at immediately.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's very important.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So you can have an urgent email.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That means it's a very important email.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Or something, a situation can be urgent.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, like an emergency, like urgent care we talk about at the hospital.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's something that needs to be looked at by a doctor immediately, urgently.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Urgently.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That would be the adverb.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now we go on to say that the email is urgent because it's from Tom, and the email said that he is in London and he got robbed.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All right, he got robbed, all right?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So to rob is the verb, R-O-B, but here it's important to look at the verb got.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This means that whatever's happening, it happened to him, to the friend, by someone else.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So someone robbed him.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, he got robbed.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That means someone took his money, right?

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the verb would be to get, and robbed would be an adjective ending E-D.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But we also have the verb to rob, and if you rob someone, that means that you are stealing his or her money.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, if I rob Marco, it means I take Marco's money from him.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But if I got robbed by Marco, it means he took my money.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So remember, if you use the verb to rob by itself, that means that you are doing the action or someone is stealing from another person.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But if you get robbed or a person got robbed, that means he or her got money taken from him.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now the friend got robbed, someone took his money, and we've been asked to wire him some money.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, to wire money.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's right, to wire money.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And this basically means to send money.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's a very old way or form of sending money.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Basically you're sending money electronically.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You don't actually buy an envelope and put some money in it and send it in the mail.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You go to a bank or Western Union and you transfer the money electronically.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So to send an electronic transfer of money, we usually say you wire someone some money.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, I'll wire it to you.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All right, now continuing on, the main topic about today's lesson is about people trying to scam other people.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right, here the verb to scam means to lie or to be dishonest with someone so that you can take their money or to take advantage of them.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So to scam means to take advantage of someone, to lie to someone, but you also have a scam, a noun, which is a situation where people are trying to take your money.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So a very famous scam might be people in a big city like Paris saying, oh, I'm a tourist.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm lost.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Can you help me?

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Can you give me some money to go to the train station?

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And really these people, they're not lost.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They just want you to give them money.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So this is called a scam.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And what they're doing is they are trying to scam you.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's right.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And so we actually have a word for these type of people.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We say they are con artists.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They are conning you.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A con artist.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
OK, so we know what an artist is.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
An artist is a person who maybe paints pictures or, you know, makes something creative.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But a con is someone who breaks the law.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All right.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So a con artist is someone who creatively breaks the law.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So these are basically thieves or people who take advantage of other people or steal from other people in a very creative way.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So there are situations where they may sell something that doesn't even really belong to them.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So the thing to remember here with a con artist is that there's almost always a story.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You know, you have to they give you this story and they make you believe them and then you give them money or you give them some help that they don't deserve.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And that that way they take it away from you.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's right.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
All right.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of language here.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's take a break.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I got an urgent email from Tom.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That sounds really dodgy to me.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No way.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tom is an honest person.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He wouldn't lie to me.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I mean, think about it.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
For sure.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
All right, we're back.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we've got two friends who are talking.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
One friend says that they got an urgent email from Tom and the other says, wow, that sounds really dodgy to me.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's right.

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So if something sounds dodgy or something is dodgy, it means it doesn't really sound believable or correct or legal.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So maybe I can't trust it.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Right.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Something is dodgy.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If it doesn't sound like something I would want to trust.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And I think you can you can say it about a situation.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So this this robbery, it sounds quite dodgy.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You can also say it about food.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This food is looks kind of dodgy.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It means it doesn't really look safe.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Maybe I'll be sick if I eat it.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So it's quite dodgy looking.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Right.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Or even a person can look dodgy.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So maybe that person is not really someone you want to trust.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
A con artist doesn't always look dodgy.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But if if a con if a person looks dodgy and they ask you for money, probably shouldn't give it any money.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Right.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
All right.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So that's dodgy.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, the person answers by saying no way.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know, Tom is an honest person.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He wouldn't lie to me.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He's not dodgy.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No way.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now, this is a really popular thing to say.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And it means basically that's not possible.

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't agree with you.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I disagree.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it's pretty forceful.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Actually, you're expressing your opinion.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So if I say the Chicago White Sox are the best baseball team in the world.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No way.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, you're wrong.

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I think the Yankees are the best baseball team.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We could go back and forth.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No way.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Exactly.

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But basically you're disagreeing.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now, the situation evolves around the fact that someone may have hacked Tom's email account and send out that email.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All right.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So the phrase here would be to hack an account or to hack a website.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's important to remember that the verb to hack is pretty recent.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We talk mostly about computers and the Internet when we talk about hacking.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And it means to gain access, all right, to go into somebody's account without permission.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So maybe illegally or, like you said, without permission.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So if your email account gets hacked, it means someone else accessed it without your permission or illegally.

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So when someone has access to your account, they hack it.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Usually they send out an email with your name.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So your friends think it's you, but really it's someone who is maybe a con artist or someone who's not trustworthy.

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's right.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's exactly right.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So that's the word to hack or maybe the noun, the person that hacks is called a hacker.

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now, moving on to our last phrase.

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
When we agree with someone forcefully, like we said, no way was to disagree.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
When we do agree, we say for sure.

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So this is basically the opposite.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In this situation, we were thinking, well, do you really think someone is trying to hack his account?

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The answer was for sure.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That means definitely, absolutely.

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

188
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So for sure, it's another way of agreeing, strongly agreeing with someone or with what someone said.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For sure.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For sure.

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
All right.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So that's all we have for today.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
For sure.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
All right, we're back.

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So talking about scams and con artists, in China, there is actually a very, very, very famous scam involving tea.

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's right.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And this is something that you might experience in Beijing or Shanghai or any big city.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I hope you don't.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But basically, as a tourist, you're traveling around, you go to a major tourist site like Tiananmen or the People's Square in Shanghai.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And some other tourists, some Chinese tourists, they come to you and they say, hello, where are you from?

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Are you traveling here?

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We're traveling too.

206
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then after about half an hour, maybe one hour of talking, they say, hey, we were thinking about going to have some tea.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's a tea festival.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Would you like to come with us?

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Right.

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And you go and you drink some tea and you chat and you think, wow, I've made some nice new friends.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
These people are very nice.

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And then you get the bill.

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Right.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And it's like 200 U.S.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
dollars, which is pretty crazy for tea.

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So it's a scam.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
These people are con artists.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
They build trust.

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They make you trust them.

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They make you think, wow, I have nice new friends.

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And then they steal your money.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
They steal your money.

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a very popular scam in China.

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So and basically, if you do come here, just be aware of it.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's usually young people.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
They say they're university students or they say they are from another city.

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And like you say, they build trust.

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They invite you to have tea.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And you think, well, why not, you know, to learn more about the culture, to learn more about the country you're visiting.

231
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And they turn out to try to scam you.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's right.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And another popular one is the artists.

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm a local artist.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I would like to show you my newest work.

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And then they take you and the work is very expensive and they make you buy it.

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So just be aware.

238
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think what you said is true, Marco, that, you know, you just have to be careful and have to recognize that not everyone wants to be your friend.

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Exactly.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So be careful when you're traveling.

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And I'm sure it happens in many other countries.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Maybe you have some stories that you've experienced or maybe some local types of scams that you may know about in your country.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's right.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
