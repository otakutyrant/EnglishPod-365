00:00:01,339 --> 00:00:03,459
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,139
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,400
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about something that is, well, not so fun when it happens.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,240
That's right.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,239
Today we're going to talk about those situations where people are trying to take advantage of us.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:17,800
All right.

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,239
They're lying to us so they can take our money.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,640
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and when we come back in a moment, we'll be talking about some of these words and phrases that you're about to hear.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,679
I got an urgent email from Tom.

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,380
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,119
What?

12
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,479
That sounds really dodgy to me.

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:41,299
No way.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,640
Tom is an honest person.

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,500
He wouldn't lie to me.

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,979
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

17
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,359
I mean, think about it.

18
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,600
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,460
For sure.

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,540
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,060
Language Takeaway.

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,079
In Language Takeaway, Marco, one of the first things we hear is that I got an urgent email from Tom.

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:15,819
That's right.

26
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,280
So this is an adjective, something that is urgent.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,299
It's urgent.

28
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,939
That means it needs to be looked at immediately.

29
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,060
It's very important.

30
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:24,859
That's right.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,939
So you can have an urgent email.

32
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,659
That means it's a very important email.

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,459
Or something, a situation can be urgent.

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:37,400
Yeah, like an emergency, like urgent care we talk about at the hospital.

35
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,500
It's something that needs to be looked at by a doctor immediately, urgently.

36
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:42,260
That's right.

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,859
Urgently.

38
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,079
That would be the adverb.

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:54,319
Now we go on to say that the email is urgent because it's from Tom, and the email said that he is in London and he got robbed.

40
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,120
All right, he got robbed, all right?

41
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,760
So to rob is the verb, R-O-B, but here it's important to look at the verb got.

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,539
This means that whatever's happening, it happened to him, to the friend, by someone else.

43
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:10,159
That's right.

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,460
So someone robbed him.

45
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,400
All right, he got robbed.

46
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,120
That means someone took his money, right?

47
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:17,780
That's right.

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,199
So the verb would be to get, and robbed would be an adjective ending E-D.

49
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:32,419
But we also have the verb to rob, and if you rob someone, that means that you are stealing his or her money.

50
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,919
Yeah, if I rob Marco, it means I take Marco's money from him.

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,439
But if I got robbed by Marco, it means he took my money.

52
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,240
That's right.

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,060
So remember, if you use the verb to rob by itself, that means that you are doing the action or someone is stealing from another person.

54
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,759
But if you get robbed or a person got robbed, that means he or her got money taken from him.

55
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:57,620
Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:05,099
Now the friend got robbed, someone took his money, and we've been asked to wire him some money.

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,919
Okay, to wire money.

58
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,419
That's right, to wire money.

59
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,560
And this basically means to send money.

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,860
It's a very old way or form of sending money.

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,479
Basically you're sending money electronically.

62
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,840
You don't actually buy an envelope and put some money in it and send it in the mail.

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,099
You go to a bank or Western Union and you transfer the money electronically.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:26,860
That's right.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,979
So to send an electronic transfer of money, we usually say you wire someone some money.

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,740
Yeah, I'll wire it to you.

67
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,479
That's right.

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:43,539
All right, now continuing on, the main topic about today's lesson is about people trying to scam other people.

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:54,780
All right, here the verb to scam means to lie or to be dishonest with someone so that you can take their money or to take advantage of them.

70
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,340
That's right.

71
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:06,180
So to scam means to take advantage of someone, to lie to someone, but you also have a scam, a noun, which is a situation where people are trying to take your money.

72
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:12,699
So a very famous scam might be people in a big city like Paris saying, oh, I'm a tourist.

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,340
I'm lost.

74
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,180
Can you help me?

75
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,800
Can you give me some money to go to the train station?

76
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,540
And really these people, they're not lost.

77
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,319
They just want you to give them money.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:21,720
That's right.

79
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,259
So this is called a scam.

80
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,420
And what they're doing is they are trying to scam you.

81
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,379
That's right.

82
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,660
And so we actually have a word for these type of people.

83
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,579
We say they are con artists.

84
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,079
They are conning you.

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,699
A con artist.

86
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,779
OK, so we know what an artist is.

87
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,699
An artist is a person who maybe paints pictures or, you know, makes something creative.

88
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,500
But a con is someone who breaks the law.

89
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:49,660
All right.

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,839
So a con artist is someone who creatively breaks the law.

91
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:54,540
That's right.

92
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:03,620
So these are basically thieves or people who take advantage of other people or steal from other people in a very creative way.

93
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,740
So there are situations where they may sell something that doesn't even really belong to them.

94
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:10,439
That's right.

95
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,680
So the thing to remember here with a con artist is that there's almost always a story.

96
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:24,680
You know, you have to they give you this story and they make you believe them and then you give them money or you give them some help that they don't deserve.

97
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,439
And that that way they take it away from you.

98
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,240
That's right.

99
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:27,980
All right.

100
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,800
So we've taken a look at a lot of language here.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,600
Let's take a break.

102
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,699
Listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

103
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,620
I got an urgent email from Tom.

104
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,300
He says he's in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.

105
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,040
What?

106
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,420
That sounds really dodgy to me.

107
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,240
No way.

108
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,560
Tom is an honest person.

109
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,439
He wouldn't lie to me.

110
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,920
No, I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out.

111
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,279
I mean, think about it.

112
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,519
Why would he email you instead of calling you?

113
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,540
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

114
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:01,379
For sure.

115
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,399
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.

116
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,019
All right, we're back.

117
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,079
Let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,019
So we've got two friends who are talking.

119
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,519
One friend says that they got an urgent email from Tom and the other says, wow, that sounds really dodgy to me.

120
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,199
That's right.

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:36,800
So if something sounds dodgy or something is dodgy, it means it doesn't really sound believable or correct or legal.

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,500
That's right.

123
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:39,879
So maybe I can't trust it.

124
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,279
Right.

125
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,060
Something is dodgy.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,180
If it doesn't sound like something I would want to trust.

127
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,000
And I think you can you can say it about a situation.

128
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,800
So this this robbery, it sounds quite dodgy.

129
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,379
You can also say it about food.

130
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,079
This food is looks kind of dodgy.

131
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,459
It means it doesn't really look safe.

132
00:06:58,699 --> 00:06:59,040
Yeah.

133
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,899
Maybe I'll be sick if I eat it.

134
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:02,680
So it's quite dodgy looking.

135
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,079
Right.

136
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,680
Or even a person can look dodgy.

137
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:07,100
So maybe that person is not really someone you want to trust.

138
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,680
A con artist doesn't always look dodgy.

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,339
But if if a con if a person looks dodgy and they ask you for money, probably shouldn't give it any money.

140
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:15,899
Right.

141
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:16,819
All right.

142
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:17,600
So that's dodgy.

143
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,420
Now, the person answers by saying no way.

144
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:23,079
You know, Tom is an honest person.

145
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,920
He wouldn't lie to me.

146
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,779
He's not dodgy.

147
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:25,680
No way.

148
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,519
Right.

149
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,660
Now, this is a really popular thing to say.

150
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,300
And it means basically that's not possible.

151
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,480
I don't agree with you.

152
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,100
I disagree.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,480
And it's pretty forceful.

154
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,259
Actually, you're expressing your opinion.

155
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:44,180
So if I say the Chicago White Sox are the best baseball team in the world.

156
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,019
No way.

157
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,920
No, you're wrong.

158
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,120
I think the Yankees are the best baseball team.

159
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,519
We could go back and forth.

160
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:51,139
No way.

161
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:51,560
Right.

162
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:52,019
Exactly.

163
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,699
But basically you're disagreeing.

164
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,439
That's right.

165
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:03,480
Now, the situation evolves around the fact that someone may have hacked Tom's email account and send out that email.

166
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,120
All right.

167
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,379
So the phrase here would be to hack an account or to hack a website.

168
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,040
It's important to remember that the verb to hack is pretty recent.

169
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,100
We talk mostly about computers and the Internet when we talk about hacking.

170
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:23,759
And it means to gain access, all right, to go into somebody's account without permission.

171
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:28,180
So maybe illegally or, like you said, without permission.

172
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:35,320
So if your email account gets hacked, it means someone else accessed it without your permission or illegally.

173
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,299
So when someone has access to your account, they hack it.

174
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,580
Usually they send out an email with your name.

175
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:52,500
So your friends think it's you, but really it's someone who is maybe a con artist or someone who's not trustworthy.

176
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,240
That's right.

177
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:54,240
That's exactly right.

178
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,720
So that's the word to hack or maybe the noun, the person that hacks is called a hacker.

179
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,639
Now, moving on to our last phrase.

180
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,740
When we agree with someone forcefully, like we said, no way was to disagree.

181
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,940
When we do agree, we say for sure.

182
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,679
That's right.

183
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,139
So this is basically the opposite.

184
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,419
In this situation, we were thinking, well, do you really think someone is trying to hack his account?

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,639
The answer was for sure.

186
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,720
That means definitely, absolutely.

187
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,159
That's right.

188
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,879
So for sure, it's another way of agreeing, strongly agreeing with someone or with what someone said.

189
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,059
For sure.

190
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:32,740
For sure.

191
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,519
All right.

192
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,120
So that's all we have for today.

193
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,419
Let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

194
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,220
Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?

195
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,039
For sure.

196
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,179
There's so many con artists out there you never really know.

197
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:12,879
All right, we're back.

198
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:23,840
So talking about scams and con artists, in China, there is actually a very, very, very famous scam involving tea.

199
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:24,840
That's right.

200
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,220
And this is something that you might experience in Beijing or Shanghai or any big city.

201
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,539
I hope you don't.

202
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:38,600
But basically, as a tourist, you're traveling around, you go to a major tourist site like Tiananmen or the People's Square in Shanghai.

203
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,879
And some other tourists, some Chinese tourists, they come to you and they say, hello, where are you from?

204
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,960
Are you traveling here?

205
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,179
We're traveling too.

206
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,919
And then after about half an hour, maybe one hour of talking, they say, hey, we were thinking about going to have some tea.

207
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,259
There's a tea festival.

208
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,980
Would you like to come with us?

209
00:10:58,419 --> 00:10:58,440
Right.

210
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,100
And you go and you drink some tea and you chat and you think, wow, I've made some nice new friends.

211
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,279
These people are very nice.

212
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,539
And then you get the bill.

213
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,139
Right.

214
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,059
And it's like 200 U.S.

215
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,220
dollars, which is pretty crazy for tea.

216
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,759
So it's a scam.

217
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,779
These people are con artists.

218
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,500
They build trust.

219
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,600
They make you trust them.

220
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,580
They make you think, wow, I have nice new friends.

221
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,740
And then they steal your money.

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,559
They steal your money.

223
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:23,980
That's right.

224
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,940
It's a very popular scam in China.

225
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,320
So and basically, if you do come here, just be aware of it.

226
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,360
It's usually young people.

227
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,799
They say they're university students or they say they are from another city.

228
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,879
And like you say, they build trust.

229
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,940
They invite you to have tea.

230
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:48,080
And you think, well, why not, you know, to learn more about the culture, to learn more about the country you're visiting.

231
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,179
And they turn out to try to scam you.

232
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:51,720
That's right.

233
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,519
And another popular one is the artists.

234
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,059
I'm a local artist.

235
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,220
I would like to show you my newest work.

236
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,759
And then they take you and the work is very expensive and they make you buy it.

237
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,440
So just be aware.

238
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:11,779
I think what you said is true, Marco, that, you know, you just have to be careful and have to recognize that not everyone wants to be your friend.

239
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:12,580
Exactly.

240
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:12,879
Yes.

241
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,399
So be careful when you're traveling.

242
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,679
And I'm sure it happens in many other countries.

243
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:25,379
Maybe you have some stories that you've experienced or maybe some local types of scams that you may know about in your country.

244
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:25,919
That's right.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,620
