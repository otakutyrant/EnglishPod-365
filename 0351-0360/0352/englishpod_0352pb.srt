00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today, Marco, we're talking about some very special places, right?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to talk about the famous list of the seven wonders of the world.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So you've probably heard about this before.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're not going to tell you what this means quite yet.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Take a listen to today's dialogue, and when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more about what these wonders are and where they are.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Have you seen this news article?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Apparently, an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world, and people could vote for them online.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wow, that's really interesting.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So who won?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I've been there.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The entire complex is made of white marble, and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Cool.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Also amongst the winners is Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, and the pyramid in Chichen Itza in Mexico.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good idea.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So let's talk about these very interesting places all over the world now on Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So the set phrase for this, Marco, is the seven wonders of the world.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, the key here is the word wonder.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is a wonder?

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Right.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A wonder is something very amazing, incredible.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's something that's beyond your imagination almost.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can't even imagine how man or how someone created it.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And so wonderful is a similar word that's an adjective, something that's just great, fantastic, is wonderful.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A wonder is something very, very special, and here we have seven of them.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So it's a list, basically, that you can see even online about these wonders all over the world, and they're so special because they are amazing works of art and architecture.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And starting off with one of the most famous ones is in China.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's the Great Wall of China.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think what's special about this, I've heard, is that when astronauts are in space, it's so long and so distinct, they can actually see the Great Wall.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, that's what I've heard as well.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a very long wall, thousands of kilometers long.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right, and it goes east to west all across the northern border of China.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's right.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So it's a very big wall, and what's interesting about it is that it was built such a long time ago and that the techniques used to make it were very special.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And sometimes you might hear us talk about the Great Wall instead of the Great Wall of China, and so that's just a hint.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's easy to say the Great Wall.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can say them both ways, though.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now, moving west towards India, we have another very amazing work of architecture.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's called the Taj Mahal.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, the Taj Mahal is in north India in a city called Agra, and it's very special because it's massive, it's very big, and it's all white marble.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's right.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And it's interesting because this place, the Taj Mahal, is not really a temple.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It was actually a tomb.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, now that's an interesting word to look at.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A tomb is a place where we bury someone, you know, after someone dies.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Maybe if you have a lot of money, you're very rich, you want to put that body in a very special sacred place, and that's called a tomb.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So this is actually what the Taj Mahal is.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now, we saw in the dialogue that the entire complex of the Taj Mahal is made of white marble.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So when we talk about the entire complex, what do we mean?

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, complex here is a noun.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You might have heard it in other situations where it's an adjective, it means something different.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But here a complex means many buildings together, right?

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you can say the Taj Mahal is one building, but the Taj Mahal complex maybe has four or five buildings together, so a side temple and a gatehouse.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And so we say a complex is a grouping of buildings.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right, very good.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So now let's move on.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's take a look at Language Takeaway Part 2, and let's continue talking about these wonders of the world.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Now the top of our list in Language Takeaway Part 2 is actually a place I would love to go to.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've never been there.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's in Jordan, which is a country in the Middle East, and it's called Petra.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Petra, that's right.

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is actually a city, but it's also known as the Lost City of Petra, right?

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's right, and what's unique about this city is that the city is built.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's carved out of stone in this cliff, so it's not just pieces of stone put together, it's actually inside the rocks.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Exactly.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So it's very famous.

81
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You've probably seen it in movies like Indiana Jones.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There's a big part of the scenes that go on inside Petra.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Very special place, and again, very unique.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now the next site is actually very far away in South America, and again, it's ancient and very intricate.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's called Machu Picchu.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So this is in one of those very old cities that are actually in ruins now, and the interesting thing about it is that it's very high up in a little mountain.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And those mountains there, those are the Andes, right?

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's right.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So Machu Picchu, also a very famous place.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Many visitors from all over the world go there as well.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And another main attraction around the world are the pyramids.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So we have some pyramids in Egypt, I think those are the most well-known ones.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The pyramids in Egypt, like the pyramid at Giza, are very big structures.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, they're huge, and they were built thousands of years ago, but they're still here because they were built so well.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But there are also very famous pyramids, like the one we heard about today in the dialogue, in Mexico.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's a little bit different, though, because the pyramids, as most of us know them, they're very smooth on the sides, you would say.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah, you can't climb on them, really.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Right.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, this one in Mexico actually has kind of like steps, so it's a different type of pyramid.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But the shape is very similar.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right, so the pyramids here are in a place called Chichen Itza, you might have heard of that.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And we have another place, though, which is also in South America in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now, this one is actually a statue, right?

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's called the Christ Redeemer.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a very big statue, very famous, you've seen it maybe in pictures.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's a statue of Jesus with his arms open.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now, the word redeemer, okay, a redeemer is a person, someone who does something, who redeems.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What does it mean to be a redeemer?

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, a redeemer is a person that saves souls, for example.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So if you redeem yourself, you're redeeming yourself of your sins, maybe.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, yeah, you're taking value back, right?

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And so in the case of Jesus, he is taking away the sins of the world, and he's redeeming, you know, that's why his arms are out, he's redeeming all people.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And that's the idea, I think, behind the Christ Redeemer statue.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So the verb redeem, like, you can use it in everyday life if you take a coupon and you redeem it.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That means you, yeah, you collect the value.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You collect the value, right?

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So you can use it, actually, this word in everyday life.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And moving on now towards Europe, we have the famous Colosseum.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ooh, now I love this one.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I've actually been there, and I know you have too recently.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But this is a circular, like a round stadium.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So it's a place where you play sports.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, you did.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's from, you know, thousands of years ago, the Roman Empire, and it's in very good shape, I would say.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can still see it.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, so it's generally called the Colosseum, although a Colosseum as we know it now can also be the same thing, right?

132
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A structure where sports or activities are played.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Basically, yeah, a Colosseum is an old stadium.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But the Colosseum, like you said, is definitely the Colosseum in Rome.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's right.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And we've probably seen movies of ancient Rome where sports or activities were taking place, specifically gladiator fights.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So that's our word there.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Gladiator.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So a gladiator is actually a person.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And a gladiator was a man who, thousands of years ago during the Roman Empire, would fight maybe other men or animals, and he had to fight to stay alive.

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So that was his profession, basically, to be a gladiator.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So now as you are a boxer, back then you were a gladiator.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, and there are actually some very famous movies about gladiators, like the movie Gladiator with Russell Crowe.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So it's a pretty common word these days.

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Okay, so let's take a break.

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Have you seen this news article?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Apparently, an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world, and people could vote for them online.

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wow, that's really interesting.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So who won?

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I've been there.

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

156
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The entire complex is made of white marble, and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Cool.

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Also amongst the winners is Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, and the pyramid in Chichen Itza in Mexico.

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wait a minute, it also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil, and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stay in the middle like a gladiator.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare, and we can go towards the end of the year.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Good idea.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
All right, so this list that we gave you are actually the new Seven Wonders of the World.

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It was voted online, people all over the world, out of different candidates or different places that were considered to be the new Seven Wonders of the World.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Among those, some of them that didn't win, for example, was Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, I never understood that, you know?

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think Angkor Wat is such an amazing place and so big, and it was the heart of this old civilization, and instead we have other things like a statue.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't agree with it as well.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But actually, the Statue of Liberty of the United States was also considered as a candidate for a Wonder of the World.

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, that's right.

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
America doesn't have any wonders.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You have natural wonders, I think.

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The Grand Canyon is considered, I think, one of those natural wonders.

174
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes, and I think Niagara Falls also, maybe.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But that's an interesting point, though, Marco.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We've got the great wonders of the world, and we've got the natural wonders.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What's the difference?

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, a natural wonder of the world means that it's there naturally.

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's not man-made.

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All of these things that we see here, somebody had to make them, whereas, for example, the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls, they are there naturally.

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's by nature.

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, so man-made versus natural, or made by nature.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Right.

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So it's very interesting because you have, like we said, natural seven wonders of the world.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You have these, the new ones.

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You have the ancient world wonders, which none of them exist anymore.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think only the pyramids.

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The hanging gardens.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The gardens of, yeah, the hanging gardens of Babylon and the Colossus at Rhodes.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah, those ones are very cool, but not, like you said, not around anymore.

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So, but maybe some of you actually, maybe your countries were considered to host one of these wonders, or maybe you voted for some of them.

192
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, let us know.

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What is a wonder where you come from?

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Doesn't have to be on this list.

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It can be something you think is wonderful.

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let us know.

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Bye.
