00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,439
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,139
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:09,179
My name is Katherine, and today, Marco, we're talking about some very special places, right?

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,880
That's right.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,919
Today we're going to talk about the famous list of the seven wonders of the world.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,859
So you've probably heard about this before.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,760
We're not going to tell you what this means quite yet.

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,140
Take a listen to today's dialogue, and when we come back, we'll talk a little bit more about what these wonders are and where they are.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,719
Have you seen this news article?

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:42,939
Apparently, an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world, and people could vote for them online.

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,840
Wow, that's really interesting.

12
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,359
So who won?

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,500
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,240
I've been there.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,359
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,679
The entire complex is made of white marble, and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,140
Cool.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,079
Also amongst the winners is Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, and the pyramid in Chichen Itza in Mexico.

19
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,099
Wait a minute.

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,799
It also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders.

21
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:21,799
I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator.

22
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,359
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.

23
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,239
Good idea.

24
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,659
All right, we're back.

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,659
So let's talk about these very interesting places all over the world now on Language Takeaway.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,359
Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:45,599
So the set phrase for this, Marco, is the seven wonders of the world.

28
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,400
Now, the key here is the word wonder.

29
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,260
What is a wonder?

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:48,680
Right.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,879
A wonder is something very amazing, incredible.

32
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,879
It's something that's beyond your imagination almost.

33
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:57,620
That's right.

34
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,540
You can't even imagine how man or how someone created it.

35
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:09,580
And so wonderful is a similar word that's an adjective, something that's just great, fantastic, is wonderful.

36
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,240
A wonder is something very, very special, and here we have seven of them.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,020
That's right.

38
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:27,060
So it's a list, basically, that you can see even online about these wonders all over the world, and they're so special because they are amazing works of art and architecture.

39
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,379
And starting off with one of the most famous ones is in China.

40
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,219
It's the Great Wall of China.

41
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:42,599
I think what's special about this, I've heard, is that when astronauts are in space, it's so long and so distinct, they can actually see the Great Wall.

42
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,340
Yeah, that's what I've heard as well.

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,219
It's a very long wall, thousands of kilometers long.

44
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,479
That's right, and it goes east to west all across the northern border of China.

45
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,580
That's right.

46
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:05,780
So it's a very big wall, and what's interesting about it is that it was built such a long time ago and that the techniques used to make it were very special.

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,780
That's right.

48
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:13,860
And sometimes you might hear us talk about the Great Wall instead of the Great Wall of China, and so that's just a hint.

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,740
It's easy to say the Great Wall.

50
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,060
You can say them both ways, though.

51
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,180
Now, moving west towards India, we have another very amazing work of architecture.

52
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,139
It's called the Taj Mahal.

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:36,879
Now, the Taj Mahal is in north India in a city called Agra, and it's very special because it's massive, it's very big, and it's all white marble.

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,659
That's right.

55
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:42,900
And it's interesting because this place, the Taj Mahal, is not really a temple.

56
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,919
It was actually a tomb.

57
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,659
All right, now that's an interesting word to look at.

58
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,180
A tomb is a place where we bury someone, you know, after someone dies.

59
00:03:54,439 --> 00:04:02,400
Maybe if you have a lot of money, you're very rich, you want to put that body in a very special sacred place, and that's called a tomb.

60
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,259
That's right.

61
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,599
So this is actually what the Taj Mahal is.

62
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:13,020
Now, we saw in the dialogue that the entire complex of the Taj Mahal is made of white marble.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,959
So when we talk about the entire complex, what do we mean?

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,319
Well, complex here is a noun.

65
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,300
You might have heard it in other situations where it's an adjective, it means something different.

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,000
But here a complex means many buildings together, right?

67
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:41,360
So you can say the Taj Mahal is one building, but the Taj Mahal complex maybe has four or five buildings together, so a side temple and a gatehouse.

68
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,699
And so we say a complex is a grouping of buildings.

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,819
That's right, very good.

70
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,500
So now let's move on.

71
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:54,639
Let's take a look at Language Takeaway Part 2, and let's continue talking about these wonders of the world.

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,699
Now the top of our list in Language Takeaway Part 2 is actually a place I would love to go to.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,699
I've never been there.

74
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,259
It's in Jordan, which is a country in the Middle East, and it's called Petra.

75
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,779
Petra, that's right.

76
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,980
This is actually a city, but it's also known as the Lost City of Petra, right?

77
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,639
That's right, and what's unique about this city is that the city is built.

78
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:26,439
It's carved out of stone in this cliff, so it's not just pieces of stone put together, it's actually inside the rocks.

79
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,160
Exactly.

80
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,379
So it's very famous.

81
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,139
You've probably seen it in movies like Indiana Jones.

82
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,360
There's a big part of the scenes that go on inside Petra.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,740
Very special place, and again, very unique.

84
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:47,819
Now the next site is actually very far away in South America, and again, it's ancient and very intricate.

85
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,579
It's called Machu Picchu.

86
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,480
That's right.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:06:01,100
So this is in one of those very old cities that are actually in ruins now, and the interesting thing about it is that it's very high up in a little mountain.

88
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:03,699
And those mountains there, those are the Andes, right?

89
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:04,480
That's right.

90
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,360
So Machu Picchu, also a very famous place.

91
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,800
Many visitors from all over the world go there as well.

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,560
And another main attraction around the world are the pyramids.

93
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:18,540
So we have some pyramids in Egypt, I think those are the most well-known ones.

94
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,199
That's right.

95
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,379
The pyramids in Egypt, like the pyramid at Giza, are very big structures.

96
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:30,920
I mean, they're huge, and they were built thousands of years ago, but they're still here because they were built so well.

97
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,019
But there are also very famous pyramids, like the one we heard about today in the dialogue, in Mexico.

98
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:37,899
That's right.

99
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,959
It's a little bit different, though, because the pyramids, as most of us know them, they're very smooth on the sides, you would say.

100
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,759
Yeah, you can't climb on them, really.

101
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,160
Right.

102
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:54,199
Well, this one in Mexico actually has kind of like steps, so it's a different type of pyramid.

103
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,439
But the shape is very similar.

104
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,899
All right, so the pyramids here are in a place called Chichen Itza, you might have heard of that.

105
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,240
And we have another place, though, which is also in South America in the city of Rio de Janeiro.

106
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,959
Now, this one is actually a statue, right?

107
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,699
That's right.

108
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,480
It's called the Christ Redeemer.

109
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,680
It's a very big statue, very famous, you've seen it maybe in pictures.

110
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,480
It's a statue of Jesus with his arms open.

111
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,759
Now, the word redeemer, okay, a redeemer is a person, someone who does something, who redeems.

112
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:29,379
What does it mean to be a redeemer?

113
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,620
Well, a redeemer is a person that saves souls, for example.

114
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,740
So if you redeem yourself, you're redeeming yourself of your sins, maybe.

115
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,759
Well, yeah, you're taking value back, right?

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,800
And so in the case of Jesus, he is taking away the sins of the world, and he's redeeming, you know, that's why his arms are out, he's redeeming all people.

117
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,600
And that's the idea, I think, behind the Christ Redeemer statue.

118
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,220
So the verb redeem, like, you can use it in everyday life if you take a coupon and you redeem it.

119
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,259
That means you, yeah, you collect the value.

120
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,319
You collect the value, right?

121
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:01,720
So you can use it, actually, this word in everyday life.

122
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:02,279
You can.

123
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,120
And moving on now towards Europe, we have the famous Colosseum.

124
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,920
Ooh, now I love this one.

125
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,180
I've actually been there, and I know you have too recently.

126
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,259
But this is a circular, like a round stadium.

127
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,860
So it's a place where you play sports.

128
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,699
Well, you did.

129
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:25,519
It's from, you know, thousands of years ago, the Roman Empire, and it's in very good shape, I would say.

130
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,439
You can still see it.

131
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:33,700
Yeah, so it's generally called the Colosseum, although a Colosseum as we know it now can also be the same thing, right?

132
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,919
A structure where sports or activities are played.

133
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,500
Basically, yeah, a Colosseum is an old stadium.

134
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,340
But the Colosseum, like you said, is definitely the Colosseum in Rome.

135
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,039
That's right.

136
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:52,559
And we've probably seen movies of ancient Rome where sports or activities were taking place, specifically gladiator fights.

137
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:53,399
So that's our word there.

138
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:53,980
Gladiator.

139
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,940
Yeah, that's right.

140
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,639
So a gladiator is actually a person.

141
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:08,139
And a gladiator was a man who, thousands of years ago during the Roman Empire, would fight maybe other men or animals, and he had to fight to stay alive.

142
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,139
So that was his profession, basically, to be a gladiator.

143
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,600
So now as you are a boxer, back then you were a gladiator.

144
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:19,480
Yeah, and there are actually some very famous movies about gladiators, like the movie Gladiator with Russell Crowe.

145
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,659
So it's a pretty common word these days.

146
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,360
That's right.

147
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,100
Okay, so let's take a break.

148
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

149
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,759
Have you seen this news article?

150
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:43,000
Apparently, an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world, and people could vote for them online.

151
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,879
Wow, that's really interesting.

152
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,379
So who won?

153
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,539
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

154
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,299
I've been there.

155
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:54,379
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

156
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:01,659
The entire complex is made of white marble, and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds.

157
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,200
Cool.

158
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:10,120
Also amongst the winners is Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, and the pyramid in Chichen Itza in Mexico.

159
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,759
Wait a minute, it also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil, and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders.

160
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,820
I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stay in the middle like a gladiator.

161
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,379
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare, and we can go towards the end of the year.

162
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,279
Good idea.

163
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:34,539
All right, so this list that we gave you are actually the new Seven Wonders of the World.

164
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:44,559
It was voted online, people all over the world, out of different candidates or different places that were considered to be the new Seven Wonders of the World.

165
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,620
Among those, some of them that didn't win, for example, was Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,759
Yeah, I never understood that, you know?

167
00:10:51,759 --> 00:11:02,659
I think Angkor Wat is such an amazing place and so big, and it was the heart of this old civilization, and instead we have other things like a statue.

168
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,220
I don't agree with it as well.

169
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,919
But actually, the Statue of Liberty of the United States was also considered as a candidate for a Wonder of the World.

170
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,519
Well, that's right.

171
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,220
America doesn't have any wonders.

172
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,440
You have natural wonders, I think.

173
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,519
The Grand Canyon is considered, I think, one of those natural wonders.

174
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,460
Yes, and I think Niagara Falls also, maybe.

175
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,100
But that's an interesting point, though, Marco.

176
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,340
We've got the great wonders of the world, and we've got the natural wonders.

177
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,120
What's the difference?

178
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,360
Well, a natural wonder of the world means that it's there naturally.

179
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,440
It's not man-made.

180
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:41,759
All of these things that we see here, somebody had to make them, whereas, for example, the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls, they are there naturally.

181
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,539
It's by nature.

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,000
All right, so man-made versus natural, or made by nature.

183
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:47,539
Right.

184
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:52,799
So it's very interesting because you have, like we said, natural seven wonders of the world.

185
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,399
You have these, the new ones.

186
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,179
You have the ancient world wonders, which none of them exist anymore.

187
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,299
I think only the pyramids.

188
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:01,840
The hanging gardens.

189
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,960
The gardens of, yeah, the hanging gardens of Babylon and the Colossus at Rhodes.

190
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,759
Yeah, those ones are very cool, but not, like you said, not around anymore.

191
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:21,179
So, but maybe some of you actually, maybe your countries were considered to host one of these wonders, or maybe you voted for some of them.

192
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:22,100
Yeah, let us know.

193
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,740
What is a wonder where you come from?

194
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,080
Doesn't have to be on this list.

195
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,899
It can be something you think is wonderful.

196
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,799
Let us know.

197
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,419
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

198
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,399
All right, we'll see you guys there.

199
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:31,700
Bye.
