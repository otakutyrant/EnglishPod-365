Apparently, an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,719
Wow, that's really interesting.

4
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,239
So, who won?

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,379
Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,120
I've been there.

7
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,239
It really is an amazing work of architecture and art.

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:35,659
The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds.

9
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,039
Cool.

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:43,960
Also amongst the winners is Petra in Jordan, Machu Picchu in Peru, and the Pyramid in Chichen Itza in Mexico.

11
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:44,979
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:50,659
It also says that the Christ Redeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders.

13
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:53,899
I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum.

14
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,679
Stay in the middle like a gladiator.

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,240
Well, let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.

16
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:01,159
Good idea.
