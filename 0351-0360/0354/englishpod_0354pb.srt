00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,559
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:13,939
And today we're talking about a kind of education that is quite unique, actually, a little bit different from the kind of education that most people get.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,640
That's right.

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:21,039
So we normally go to school to learn, but on this occasion, we're going to talk about a different way of obtaining your education.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,719
We're talking about homeschooling someone.

8
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,980
Let's check this word out in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,060
All right, so the word is homeschool to homeschool someone.

10
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,200
It's, I guess, a verb.

11
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:39,240
And what does it mean if you're homeschooled?

12
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:45,859
Well, you think about the word school, home, it means that you study at home, but you don't go to school every day.

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:52,479
Instead, you have a parent or maybe a friend of a parent who comes to your house to teach you every day.

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:01:00,740
So it's basically like having a tutor for, but not to help you with school, but to actually teach you everything that you learn at school.

15
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,280
That's right.

16
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,760
And some people are homeschooled with their siblings, so brothers and sisters.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,939
Other people are homeschooled alone.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,079
We'll talk about some of these things in a moment, but let's take a listen to our dialogue.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

20
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:20,900
What?

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:21,900
Why?

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,560
Well, our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

23
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,459
I have been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

24
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:31,680
Like what?

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,920
I think that by doing something like that, we would be isolating our children from social interaction.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way.

27
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,980
I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.

28
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,719
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,719
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,780
Good luck with that.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,620
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:02,980
So now let's take a look at some of that language on language takeaway.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,620
Language takeaway.

34
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:14,719
So as we mentioned in the introduction to today's podcast, homeschooling is one of many different educational options.

35
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,039
The most common ones are, in the beginning of the dialogue, public and private school.

36
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:26,580
Right, so in most places, you will have public schools where basically the education is paid for by the government.

37
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,800
Yeah, that's right.

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,699
So public schools are schools that are available to all students.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,039
You don't have to pay to attend them.

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,800
This is, of course, in America.

41
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:42,300
In Britain, the system is a bit different, but in America, you have the public schools, which most kids go to.

42
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,180
Of course, if your parents don't want you to study in public school, there's another option that's called private school.

43
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:47,879
That's right.

44
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:56,479
So a private school, as the name says, it's not really private, but what happens is that it's not available free for everyone.

45
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,520
You have to actually pay to go to the school.

46
00:02:58,819 --> 00:02:59,180
That's right.

47
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,099
The school has a tuition, kind of like a private college or university.

48
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:10,599
So you have to pay every semester or every year, and usually these schools also have application standards.

49
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:13,680
So they interview you, they interview your parents.

50
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,860
So there's a lot of different things you have to do to attend these schools.

51
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,840
So they're a bit more exclusive.

52
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,620
That's right.

53
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,780
Now, so these are basically some three options.

54
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,379
You have homeschooling, public schools, private schools.

55
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:36,080
And well, the two parents are kind of discussing the options of why it would be maybe not a good idea to homeschool one of the kids.

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,860
And she says that it would be isolating our children from social interaction.

57
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,479
All right.

58
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,340
So let's take a word.

59
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,840
So first, let's take a look at the word to isolate, this is a verb.

60
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,439
And I like to think of island, isolate, kind of similar in a way.

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,560
Basically to isolate from is to keep away from.

62
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,580
So if your student or your child is being homeschooled, he or she might be isolated from other students.

63
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,780
They're not near or with other students.

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,400
That's right.

65
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,300
So to isolate means to keep away from or to keep separately.

66
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:14,120
So like you said, maybe if you're on an island, you are isolated from the rest of the world.

67
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:14,639
That's right.

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,720
Or if I live in the country far away from the city, I feel isolated from other people.

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,360
So she's saying that the kid might be isolated from social interaction.

70
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:26,259
All right.

71
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,399
Now social interaction, this is a two word phrase.

72
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,220
We usually take it as a phrase.

73
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,240
This basically means talking to or playing with other people, other kids.

74
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:46,720
So I guess in this case, it's personal or physical social interaction because nowadays you have social interaction via the internet.

75
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:47,819
That's right.

76
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:54,240
But in the case of a student going to school, it would be, of course, playing on the playground, attending class.

77
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,160
But social interaction means talking to or being with other people.

78
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,040
That's right.

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,339
Well, and the other parent argued that there are many advantages.

80
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,839
And specifically, he said that having a one on one class is better for the kids.

81
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:09,800
All right.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,160
So this word one on one refers to one teacher, one student, right?

83
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,800
One parent, one child.

84
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,459
It means when you're talking to someone and there's no one else around.

85
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,339
All right.

86
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,060
So usually tutors teach you one on one, right?

87
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,220
You sit at a table and your tutor helps you study.

88
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,699
But in the case of homeschooling, the student learns one on one, so learns directly from the teacher.

89
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,800
And that's different from public schools, obviously, because you have one teacher for maybe 30 students.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,459
That's right.

91
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,699
So that's not one on one.

92
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,800
That's one on many.

93
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,360
Right.

94
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:40,899
Exactly.

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,420
But one on one is also a word you can use when you talk about meetings.

96
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,459
So you could say, hey, Marco, can we have a one on one meeting later?

97
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,959
I'd like to talk to you alone.

98
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,540
So that means I'm not going to talk to you with other people.

99
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:51,959
Right.

100
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:52,480
OK.

101
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,759
It's like a private meeting.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,079
Yeah.

103
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,819
Very good.

104
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:57,060
So let's take a listen to the dialogue again.

105
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,439
And then we're going to come back and we're going to take a look at some key phrases.

106
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,720
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

107
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:10,259
What?

108
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:11,300
Why?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Well, our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

110
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,800
I have been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

111
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,019
Like what?

112
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:26,259
I think that by doing something like that, we would be isolating our children from social interaction.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,420
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way.

114
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:37,300
I also think that having a one on one class is much better, since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,040
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

116
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,019
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

117
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:44,639
Good luck with that.

118
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,259
All right.

119
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,439
We've picked out four key phrases for you today.

120
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,759
Let's take a look at those on Fluency Builder.

121
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,459
So the first phrase today in Fluency Builder is the phrase to read up on.

122
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,959
So the sentence was, I've been reading up on homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

123
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:16,459
So basically, if you say you have been reading up on a subject or a topic or something, it means that you've been reading about it.

124
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,420
You've kind of been informing yourself.

125
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,779
You're doing research about a topic.

126
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,259
So in this case, one parent is researching the homeschooling option.

127
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,379
So here she is reading maybe articles in a magazine or books or looking on the Internet.

128
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,980
But you don't actually just have to read up on education.

129
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,480
You can read up on anything, right?

130
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,540
Exactly.

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,800
So you can read up on anything that interests you or you can do research on anything.

132
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,259
So you can read up on dinosaurs, for example.

133
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,519
I've been reading up on dinosaurs lately.

134
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,420
And did you know that the Brontosaurus is not a real dinosaur anymore?

135
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:54,699
That's right.

136
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,720
Okay, so we've been reading up on the advantages of homeschooling.

137
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,379
And he starts by defending his position on what the advantages are with the phrase.

138
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,439
Well, first of all.

139
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,779
All right, this is an important little phrase.

140
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:16,879
This is something you can use, like you say, Marco, when you're going to have an argument or maybe a discussion about something and you want to tell your points, your side of the argument.

141
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,600
And so first of all means I have a list, but this is my first point.

142
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:27,620
So it's a nice little phrase to open up this list of things that you're going to say, right?

143
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,600
That's right.

144
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,980
So you should drink orange juice, Marco, because first of all, it tastes good.

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
But second of all, or but also it's very good for your body.

146
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,360
Right.

147
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,480
So first of all is the first main point.

148
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,080
So you can say second of all.

149
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,799
Can you go like third of all, fourth of all?

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,460
Not really, right?

151
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,700
No, you don't really say it.

152
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,220
I guess you could, but.

153
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,259
So you go first of all, second of all, and then maybe just go and also.

154
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Or lastly.

155
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,120
And then lastly to end it.

156
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,399
Okay, very good.

157
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:11,820
Now, one of the other points that he talked about, well, apart from the one on one class, was that the reason why a one on one class was better is because he could focus on his or her strengths and or weaknesses.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,200
All right.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,000
So strengths or weaknesses or strengths and weaknesses.

160
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,179
This is a set phrase, and it's important to remember that these two words are opposites.

161
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,039
So strengths, that's the things you're good at.

162
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,159
And weaknesses.

163
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,620
Things you're bad at.

164
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,519
Things you're bad at.

165
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:36,779
And so especially when you're studying in a school or you're homeschooling, it's important that the teacher understands the strengths and weaknesses of the student.

166
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,320
Right.

167
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,059
Because something that you're really good at, maybe you should encourage and something you're bad at, you should work harder at improving.

168
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:43,840
That's right.

169
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,320
So it's usually a fixed phrase.

170
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
You'll even get it in job interviews.

171
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:51,139
Somebody will say, well, what do you think are your strengths and weaknesses?

172
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,860
That's right.

173
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,179
So remember that phrase, strengths and weaknesses.

174
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:56,240
Okay.

175
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:08,139
And lastly, he said that, well, even though the idea is interesting, it might be difficult to make the parents or the grandparents agree with him.

176
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,460
So he said he will bring it up over Sunday brunch.

177
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,379
Okay.

178
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,919
I will bring it up.

179
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,159
Bring it up.

180
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,179
Well, you're not actually holding something.

181
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,440
This means that you will mention it in conversation.

182
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:22,799
Mention the topic, right?

183
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,399
That's right.

184
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:33,299
So maybe grandma and grandpa don't think homeschooling is a good idea, but you will discuss it or you will suggest it during Sunday brunch.

185
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:40,120
So if you want to discuss a topic, you usually say, I will bring it up with the president, for example.

186
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:40,779
That's right.

187
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,240
You will talk about it with the president.

188
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,919
You can also say, please don't bring it up.

189
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,360
Right.

190
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:52,299
So maybe you told a secret and you don't want the other person to know and you say, oh, okay, please, Marco, don't bring it up.

191
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,720
Okay.

192
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,320
Very good.

193
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:53,980
All right.

194
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,259
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time.

195
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,600
I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,139
What?

197
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,200
Why?

198
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,799
Well, our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

199
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,700
I have been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

200
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:16,919
Like what?

201
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:22,139
I think that by doing something like that, we would be isolating our children from social interaction.

202
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:27,320
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way.

203
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,220
I also think that having a 101 class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.

204
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,960
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

205
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,919
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

206
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:40,840
Good luck with that.

207
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,259
Okay, so homeschooling is a very interesting option.

208
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,879
I think it's very common, more common nowadays in Britain and North America.

209
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,480
But how do people that are homeschooled go to college if they didn't go to a high school?

210
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:05,480
Well, I believe that most people, when they finish homeschooling, will take some tests to prove that they've actually learned the material that is required by the state.

211
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,480
Because, you know, in America, each state sets the educational standards.

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,100
And so it's important that you learn certain science and math skills.

213
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,700
And then once you take those tests, you would get your GED, your graduate diploma.

214
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,419
And that means that you've learned everything that a high school student should know.

215
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:31,659
So it's interesting because it would seem a little bit strange to not want your kid to go to school.

216
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,120
But at the same time, there are many reasons why parents don't want their kids to go to school.

217
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,179
Like in this dialogue, maybe the schools are not really good or too expensive.

218
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,100
What do you think about homeschooling?

219
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,039
Would you send your kids to homeschool?

220
00:12:43,520 --> 00:13:00,059
I don't think I would do homeschooling because I think it's really important for students to or for children to learn how to get along with others and to learn to negotiate and to learn to play and to also learn to respect their teachers because you have a different relationship with your parents than you do your teachers.

221
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,860
And I think there's a lot of valuable social lessons you can learn at school.

222
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:12,419
But I do understand why a lot of people choose this option, especially if the schools in their area are poor performing schools so that the students aren't learning enough.

223
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:17,840
Or if maybe they're not safe because some schools, there's some bullying or there's some violence.

224
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,779
And so for those reasons, I definitely understand the motivation to do homeschooling.

225
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:29,620
But then again, you can't I mean, you can get homeschooled from kindergarten all the way through high school.

226
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:37,259
But there is no homeschooling for university unless you do like an online degree or something like that.

227
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,799
You can't really be homeschooling for college.

228
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,940
No, there's distance courses, so you could use the Internet and learn online.

229
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,899
But no, you can't homeschool for university.

230
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,460
Yeah.

231
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,200
It's a very debatable topic.

232
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,559
A lot of people defend it, saying it's good.

233
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,779
You know, it brings parents closer together to their kids, that kids enjoy learning, that they learn better, et cetera.

234
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:57,580
Other people don't really agree with it.

235
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,759
So what is your opinion?

236
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,200
Do you agree with homeschooling?

237
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,360
