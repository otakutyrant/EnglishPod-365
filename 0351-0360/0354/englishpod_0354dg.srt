00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com I think we should homeschool our children when we decide to have kids.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Why?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, our public schools here are not very good and private schools are just too expensive.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I have been reading up on some homeschooling and it has a lot of advantages.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Like what?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I also think that having a 101 class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll bring it up over Sunday brunch.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Good luck with that.
