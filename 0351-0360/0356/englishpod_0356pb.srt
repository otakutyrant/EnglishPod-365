00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,839
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:04,559
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:05,200
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,059
My name is Katherine.

5
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,460
And today, Marco, we're talking about money.

6
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:09,220
That's right.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,100
We're going to take a look at another lesson about money, but this time we're going to learn a little bit more about coins in the United States.

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:17,760
That's right.

9
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:23,839
Different coins, so different sizes and shapes, they have different names because they represent different amounts of money.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,879
So today we're going to learn the names of those coins, and we're also going to learn a little bit about British money.

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,280
So let's check out the dialogue.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,000
Help me organize these coins.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,420
That's a lot of money.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,420
What'd you do?

15
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:41,439
Break the piggy bank?

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,399
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,159
Okay.

18
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,920
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:51,560
Great.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,979
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,359
I found some coins that are not from here.

22
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:56,939
Oh, yeah.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,280
Those are from my trip to London.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,820
I have like 90 pence, but it won't add up to one pound.

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,500
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

26
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,000
Hopefully.

27
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:12,159
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at some of this language on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:15,700
Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,099
So first up, Marco, we have this funny phrase, break the piggy bank.

30
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,079
What is a piggy bank?

31
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:23,680
That's right.

32
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:24,719
A piggy bank.

33
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,540
Now you may have seen this.

34
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,500
It has the shape of a little pig.

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:37,200
It's usually made out of plastic or ceramic, and it has a little hole at the top where you can put in coins and just basically save your money there.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,959
All right, so this is a pig-shaped bank, but it's a bank you keep in your room.

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,700
Mostly children have these, right?

38
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:55,319
Yeah, so if you want to save your change or you want to save some of your coins that you have or teach your children about saving money, then usually they have a little piggy bank where they can store their money.

39
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:59,700
So when you break the piggy bank, usually these were made of ceramic.

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,540
So to spend the money, you have to decide when it's very, very special or important.

41
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,759
So you have to break the entire bank, and that's when you take all the coins you've been saving.

42
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,319
Right, exactly, because they didn't really have a little hole where you could take it out from.

43
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,759
So when you wanted to take your money out, you literally had to break it.

44
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,280
Break it.

45
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,159
All right, so that's the piggy bank, but what do we store inside a piggy bank?

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,400
We don't store bills, do we?

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,159
That's right, no, we store coins.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,219
So this is an interesting word, bill, like the name bill, Bill Clinton, for example.

49
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,219
Bills are the paper money that we use.

50
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,560
All right, but not capitalized like a name, because this is a normal, a common noun.

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,039
Bills represent all paper money, so I could ask for change.

52
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,800
Could I have the change in bills, please?

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,300
That's right.

54
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:58,560
And if I'm at a store, they'll give me bills, maybe a $5 bill, a $10 bill, and this also accounts for other currencies, so if I'm in China, I might get my renminbi, my yuan, in bills.

55
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,000
So it's just a general name for paper money.

56
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:01,639
That's right.

57
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,460
So, but what we store in the piggy bank are coins.

58
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:15,280
Now talking specifically about the types of coins or the different amounts that these represent, let's take a look at those more in detail.

59
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,780
All right, so first up we've got quarters.

60
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,020
Now this should be pretty easy if you know your time, because a quarter is one-fourth of something.

61
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:28,960
So if we're talking about money, it's a quarter of a dollar or 25 cents.

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,719
That's right.

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,699
So 25 cents or a quarter of a dollar or one-fourth of a dollar, we just call it a quarter.

64
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,659
So most machines or pay phones, you need to insert quarters.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,500
That's right.

66
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,719
So you can recognize the quarter because it's the biggest coin and it has a big eagle on one side.

67
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,159
And on the other side it has George Washington's head.

68
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,280
George Washington, that's right.

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,539
Now the next in line or the next coin that we're going to take a look at are dimes.

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,659
Dimes.

71
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,800
Now these are also recognizable because they're the smallest coins, but that does not mean they're the smallest amount.

72
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,259
Dimes are actually the second largest.

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,460
They're 10 cents.

74
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,199
They're 10 cents or one-tenth of a dollar.

75
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:14,099
And so you can say they're 10 cents or you can say dime.

76
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,379
So do you have, I don't know, if you have 10 dimes, that means you get a dollar.

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,019
That's right.

78
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,779
10 dimes equal $1.

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,680
And the face on the dime is?

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:23,699
Thomas Jefferson?

81
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:24,959
Alexander Hamilton.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,060
I don't know.

83
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:33,180
No, he was the first, well, he created basically the Department of the Treasury, but Thomas Jefferson is on another coin and that's what we're going to look at next.

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:33,879
That's right.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,699
The nickel.

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,220
The nickel is like the metal, you know, nickel.

87
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,740
And yeah, so this one is a little bit bigger than the dime, but not as big as the quarter.

88
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,120
I think it's a little bit thicker maybe.

89
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,839
It is thicker, but it's not as much money.

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,920
A nickel is five cents.

91
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:52,860
Five cents.

92
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,800
So one-twentieth of a dollar.

93
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,339
That's right.

94
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,740
One-twentieth of a dollar.

95
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,279
So this is what we call a nickel.

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,899
So you would call this coin, you would say, hey, do you have any nickels?

97
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,480
Dimes and nickels usually go together.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,019
I don't know why.

99
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:05,560
Nickels and dimes.

100
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:06,259
Nickels and dimes.

101
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,779
He's counting his nickels and dimes means he doesn't have very much money.

102
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:10,660
That's right.

103
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:17,060
So, yeah, and then on this coin you have the face of Thomas Jefferson.

104
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:17,660
That's right.

105
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,120
Okay.

106
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,939
And finally we have the only coin that's not silver colored.

107
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,000
It's actually more of a copper color.

108
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,980
That would be the penny.

109
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,620
The penny.

110
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:27,079
That's right.

111
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:34,860
One cent or one penny is the smallest of the coins and actually you need 100 of these to make one dollar.

112
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,560
That's right.

113
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,600
So this is very unique because it's a different color.

114
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,259
It's the smallest amount.

115
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,879
And the face on this coin, do you know this one?

116
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,199
Yes.

117
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,319
This one is Abraham Lincoln.

118
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:46,819
Correct.

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,319
All right.

120
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,199
So we've got all these important people.

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,480
All of them were presidents actually, except for Alexander Hamilton.

122
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,139
That's right.

123
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,459
And actually I think Alexander Hamilton looks good.

124
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,600
Better than the rest.

125
00:05:58,819 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know why.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,680
He was pretty handsome.

127
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,680
Actually, no, he was said to be very funny looking, I think.

128
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:02,980
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:13,019
So actually all of these coins, you can call them by these names and everyone will recognize them, especially in the US.

130
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:21,259
Now I don't really think they apply to any other country as we saw later on, for example, money in England or the United Kingdom.

131
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,160
But usually in the US, if you say, hey, do you have any spare change or do you have any nickels and dimes?

132
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,480
Or can I borrow a penny?

133
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:30,480
Can I borrow a penny?

134
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,920
Actually, in the US, they have these little things called take a penny, leave a penny, right?

135
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,360
Or give a penny, take a penny.

136
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,180
You see these because pennies are not worth very much money.

137
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,339
And oftentimes people will leave a penny.

138
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,779
And if you have, it may, something costs 26 cents, but you only have a quarter, you can take a penny and then spend that.

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,399
So they're basically free pennies you might see in a store.

140
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,019
And then also if you get change, maybe you don't want to carry those pennies around or that change.

141
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,240
So you just leave that there.

142
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,920
And then, you know, it's kind of a way of recycling this small amount of money, which is very interesting.

143
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,779
It is very interesting.

144
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,339
But we're going to actually take a look at some British currency.

145
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,060
So let's take another listen to the dialogue.

146
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,899
And when we come back, we'll explore that.

147
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,319
Help me organize these coins.

148
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,779
That's a lot of money.

149
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:25,740
What'd you do?

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Break the piggy bank?

151
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,160
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills.

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,779
But first I have to separate them into little piles.

153
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,519
Okay.

154
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,300
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

155
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:36,879
Great.

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,300
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

157
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,699
I found some coins that are not from here.

158
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:42,240
Oh yeah.

159
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,560
Those are from my trip to London.

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,100
I have like 90 pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.

161
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,819
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

162
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,339
Hopefully.

163
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,180
All right, we're back.

164
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,339
So let's take a look at these British words on language takeaway part two.

165
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,939
So here we've got British currency, the pound, right, is the name of the currency.

166
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,720
So in America we have the dollar, in Britain we have the pound.

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,199
Is it the sterling pound?

168
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,259
Yeah, pound sterling.

169
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,120
The pound sterling.

170
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:11,839
Pound sterling.

171
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,199
And I think that has to do with weight, I'm sure.

172
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,180
But here we've got it divided into small and large quantities.

173
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,540
So where we have coins, we might have pence.

174
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,319
Sounds like cents.

175
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,279
Right, exactly.

176
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:32,039
And I think actually the penny might come from the British term pence.

177
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm sure it does, they're very similar and the meaning is basically one hundredth of a pound.

178
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,399
Right, exactly.

179
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,000
And the pound is basically what you would say in the US, a dollar, a pound is the currency of England.

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,740
But actually, you know how in the United States people would say, you know, a hundred bucks, which would be a hundred dollars, over there they say one hundred quid.

181
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:54,500
Quid.

182
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,259
So yeah, this is actually important slang.

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,720
In America I would spend five bucks at the movies, in Britain I would spend five quid, and now that's a slang term for one pound.

184
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:05,440
That's right.

185
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,840
And actually I've heard also like fifty p, which I think means fifty cents.

186
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,120
Yeah, pence.

187
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:11,600
Pence.

188
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,139
Yeah, so fifty p.

189
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,080
So you could say this stick of, or this pack of gum costs fifty p, so fifty pence.

190
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,740
That's right.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,580
Half of a pound.

192
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:35,779
So, as you can see, obviously the currencies are different, but also it is interesting to learn the way that you would say it locally, so, you know, next time if you are in Britain or you're talking to an English person, then you'd know if they say, you know, fifty quid, you understand they're talking about fifty pounds.

193
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,200
So, but they don't use the euro over there.

194
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:47,259
No, they don't, not in Great Britain, they do use the euro on the continents of France, Italy, and the euro is the name of that currency.

195
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:47,940
Okay.

196
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:55,320
Alright, so a lot of great stuff, and now lastly, although we saw it at the beginning of the dialogue, let's talk about what this person wants to do.

197
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,460
He wants to change these coins into bills.

198
00:09:59,019 --> 00:09:59,360
That's right.

199
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,539
So the verb when you need to exchange money is to change money.

200
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:08,600
So let's say if I go to England and all I have is dollars, I would say I want to change money.

201
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:14,299
Okay, you could also say exchange, but when we're speaking to one another, we normally just say change.

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:14,899
Right.

203
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:19,639
Right, because even the places are sometimes called like money changers, you know, they say that or something like that.

204
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:32,379
Exactly, and so if I want to change money, that means I want to maybe change dollars for euros or dollars for pounds, but this also can mean I want to change a dollar for some quarters.

205
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,299
Right, right.

206
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,759
Because I need quarters for like a laundry machine or a telephone.

207
00:10:37,259 --> 00:10:52,559
Right, and I've heard also the term is to break, so if maybe you have a ten dollar bill and you need maybe a five dollar bill, but you don't have one, you ask the person to break that money, so you say, can you break this bill?

208
00:10:53,059 --> 00:11:01,519
Yeah, and that actually makes sense because a bill, normally you break something that's big into smaller pieces, so if you think about it, if I break a glass, it becomes many pieces.

209
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:12,120
Well, if I break a five dollar bill, I want maybe one dollars, I get five of those, there's one piece and then it breaks into many pieces, so to break means to ask for smaller change.

210
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:12,679
That's right.

211
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:21,879
So maybe next time you guys need change, you can go up to someone and say, excuse me, can you change this five dollar bill for me or can you break this five dollar bill for me?

212
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,139
That's right.

213
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:27,320
All right, so a lot of interesting language, very useful stuff, let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

214
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,899
Help me organize these coins.

215
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,340
That's a lot of money.

216
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,360
What'd you do?

217
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,360
Break the piggy bank?

218
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,340
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,879
Okay, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

220
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,899
Great, then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

221
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,299
I found some coins that are not from here.

222
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,159
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

223
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,700
I have like 90 pence, but it won't add up to one pound.

224
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,419
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

225
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:01,960
Hopefully.

226
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:13,000
All right, coming back to the topic now, you seem to know a lot about this stuff, let's test your knowledge here.

227
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,220
On the $100 bill, who do we find?

228
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,879
What president or what person?

229
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,759
Benjamin Franklin.

230
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,000
That's right, but he wasn't a president, right?

231
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:20,860
He was not.

232
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,559
He was a very important figure in American history.

233
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,899
Many people are familiar with the story of Benjamin Franklin and the kite with the key on it, so he discovered electricity.

234
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,720
That's right, that's right.

235
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,480
He was a very important inventor and also an important person when it comes to the creation of America.

236
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,100
That's right.

237
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:44,980
Now, the smaller of the bills would be the $1 bill, and actually now you have a $1 coin as well, but on the $1 bill, do you know who's on there?

238
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
I think it's George Washington also, right?

239
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,779
I think so, yeah.

240
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,740
He's on the quarter and on the $1 bill.

241
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,320
We like to recycle our presidents.

242
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,220
The $20 bill then would be Abraham Lincoln, right?

243
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,200
That's right.

244
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:57,340
They're actually on ...

245
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,399
That's sort of unfair, though.

246
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,539
Favorite presidents in the United States, so yeah.

247
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,139
But they haven't changed over time.

248
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:19,480
In other countries, you see that they change according to the important person that's in government, or maybe like, for example, in China, you have Chairman Mao on there, which before you didn't, or in England, you have Queen Elizabeth.

249
00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:23,539
Before was the previous ruler, which I think was King George VI.

250
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,539
But in the US, you guys flat out, 100 years ago, these guys haven't changed them since then.

251
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,240
Well, I think America likes to celebrate its creation.

252
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,940
Which is still a very young country, right?

253
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,179
Right, 1776, so it's only been, what, 240 years.

254
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:47,639
So yeah, the idea is basically that we celebrate the founding, so the beginning of the republic, and the men who are involved in that, they're called the founders.

255
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:56,559
George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin.

256
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,179
These people were very important in the history of America, and that's why we celebrate them on our money.

257
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:02,360
The one exception, of course, is Abraham Lincoln.

258
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,399
He was from the 1860s, as you remember.

259
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,039
Right, 16th president.

260
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,440
That's right.

261
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:16,320
He was very important because of the Civil War, and a lot of the changes that later happened to our Constitution, and so he's another person who's maybe added on.

262
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,259
So he's basically the last guy you guys kind of celebrate, because you don't have, I don't know...

263
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:23,519
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

264
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,019
Right, or Bill Clinton, or something like this.

265
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:27,200
Not yet.

266
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,980
Right, so I guess we gotta wait a while.

267
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,980
But that's very interesting, this history aspect of currencies is actually very, very interesting.

268
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:43,820
It is, and one thing I'd like to add about quarters is that in the 2000s, so from 2000, I think, on, the United States started to make state quarters.

269
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:56,059
So you'll see oftentimes these quarters with the picture of a state, New Hampshire, Maryland, Illinois, California, and a special symbol of that state, and so these are special quarters from the last maybe 10 years or so.

270
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:06,679
Yeah, yeah, I remember seeing these because usually on the other side of the quarter one, on one side you had George Washington, on the other side you had the eagle, the emblem of the flag, I guess.

271
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,720
Not the flag, but the national bird, or the republic.

272
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:19,320
But now you have these states, and it says, you know, Delaware, and it has a little, maybe, I don't know, flower or something that's representative of these states.

273
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,419
So that was actually very nice.

274
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,259
It was a collector's type thing as well, right?

275
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,159
People were collecting these.

276
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:24,440
That's right, you can collect all 50.

277
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:27,820
Some people did that, and you still see them in use.

278
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,539
So those are the state quarters, and those generally are newer quarters.

279
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,519
Okay, interesting.

280
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:39,259
All right, guys, so we're out of time, but if you guys have any questions or doubts, you can find us at EnglishPod.com, and we'll see you guys there.

281
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,779
Bye.

282
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,120
Bye.
