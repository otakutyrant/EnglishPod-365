00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Katherine.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today, Marco, we're talking about money.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to take a look at another lesson about money, but this time we're going to learn a little bit more about coins in the United States.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Different coins, so different sizes and shapes, they have different names because they represent different amounts of money.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So today we're going to learn the names of those coins, and we're also going to learn a little bit about British money.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So let's check out the dialogue.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Help me organize these coins.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's a lot of money.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What'd you do?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Break the piggy bank?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Great.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I found some coins that are not from here.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, yeah.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Those are from my trip to London.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have like 90 pence, but it won't add up to one pound.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hopefully.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at some of this language on Language Takeaway.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So first up, Marco, we have this funny phrase, break the piggy bank.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What is a piggy bank?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A piggy bank.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Now you may have seen this.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It has the shape of a little pig.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's usually made out of plastic or ceramic, and it has a little hole at the top where you can put in coins and just basically save your money there.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
All right, so this is a pig-shaped bank, but it's a bank you keep in your room.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mostly children have these, right?

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah, so if you want to save your change or you want to save some of your coins that you have or teach your children about saving money, then usually they have a little piggy bank where they can store their money.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So when you break the piggy bank, usually these were made of ceramic.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So to spend the money, you have to decide when it's very, very special or important.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So you have to break the entire bank, and that's when you take all the coins you've been saving.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Right, exactly, because they didn't really have a little hole where you could take it out from.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So when you wanted to take your money out, you literally had to break it.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Break it.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right, so that's the piggy bank, but what do we store inside a piggy bank?

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We don't store bills, do we?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's right, no, we store coins.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this is an interesting word, bill, like the name bill, Bill Clinton, for example.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Bills are the paper money that we use.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right, but not capitalized like a name, because this is a normal, a common noun.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bills represent all paper money, so I could ask for change.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Could I have the change in bills, please?

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's right.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And if I'm at a store, they'll give me bills, maybe a $5 bill, a $10 bill, and this also accounts for other currencies, so if I'm in China, I might get my renminbi, my yuan, in bills.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So it's just a general name for paper money.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's right.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, but what we store in the piggy bank are coins.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now talking specifically about the types of coins or the different amounts that these represent, let's take a look at those more in detail.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, so first up we've got quarters.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now this should be pretty easy if you know your time, because a quarter is one-fourth of something.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So if we're talking about money, it's a quarter of a dollar or 25 cents.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's right.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So 25 cents or a quarter of a dollar or one-fourth of a dollar, we just call it a quarter.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So most machines or pay phones, you need to insert quarters.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So you can recognize the quarter because it's the biggest coin and it has a big eagle on one side.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And on the other side it has George Washington's head.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
George Washington, that's right.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now the next in line or the next coin that we're going to take a look at are dimes.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Dimes.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now these are also recognizable because they're the smallest coins, but that does not mean they're the smallest amount.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Dimes are actually the second largest.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They're 10 cents.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They're 10 cents or one-tenth of a dollar.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And so you can say they're 10 cents or you can say dime.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So do you have, I don't know, if you have 10 dimes, that means you get a dollar.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
10 dimes equal $1.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And the face on the dime is?

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Thomas Jefferson?

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Alexander Hamilton.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, he was the first, well, he created basically the Department of the Treasury, but Thomas Jefferson is on another coin and that's what we're going to look at next.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The nickel.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The nickel is like the metal, you know, nickel.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And yeah, so this one is a little bit bigger than the dime, but not as big as the quarter.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I think it's a little bit thicker maybe.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It is thicker, but it's not as much money.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A nickel is five cents.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Five cents.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So one-twentieth of a dollar.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
One-twentieth of a dollar.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So this is what we call a nickel.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So you would call this coin, you would say, hey, do you have any nickels?

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Dimes and nickels usually go together.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know why.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Nickels and dimes.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Nickels and dimes.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He's counting his nickels and dimes means he doesn't have very much money.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So, yeah, and then on this coin you have the face of Thomas Jefferson.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And finally we have the only coin that's not silver colored.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's actually more of a copper color.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That would be the penny.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The penny.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's right.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
One cent or one penny is the smallest of the coins and actually you need 100 of these to make one dollar.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So this is very unique because it's a different color.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's the smallest amount.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And the face on this coin, do you know this one?

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This one is Abraham Lincoln.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Correct.

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So we've got all these important people.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All of them were presidents actually, except for Alexander Hamilton.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's right.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And actually I think Alexander Hamilton looks good.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Better than the rest.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know why.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He was pretty handsome.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Actually, no, he was said to be very funny looking, I think.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So actually all of these coins, you can call them by these names and everyone will recognize them, especially in the US.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Now I don't really think they apply to any other country as we saw later on, for example, money in England or the United Kingdom.

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But usually in the US, if you say, hey, do you have any spare change or do you have any nickels and dimes?

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Or can I borrow a penny?

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can I borrow a penny?

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Actually, in the US, they have these little things called take a penny, leave a penny, right?

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Or give a penny, take a penny.

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You see these because pennies are not worth very much money.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And oftentimes people will leave a penny.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And if you have, it may, something costs 26 cents, but you only have a quarter, you can take a penny and then spend that.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So they're basically free pennies you might see in a store.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And then also if you get change, maybe you don't want to carry those pennies around or that change.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So you just leave that there.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And then, you know, it's kind of a way of recycling this small amount of money, which is very interesting.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It is very interesting.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But we're going to actually take a look at some British currency.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So let's take another listen to the dialogue.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And when we come back, we'll explore that.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Help me organize these coins.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's a lot of money.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What'd you do?

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Break the piggy bank?

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But first I have to separate them into little piles.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Great.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I found some coins that are not from here.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh yeah.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Those are from my trip to London.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I have like 90 pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hopefully.

163
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
All right, we're back.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So let's take a look at these British words on language takeaway part two.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So here we've got British currency, the pound, right, is the name of the currency.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So in America we have the dollar, in Britain we have the pound.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is it the sterling pound?

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah, pound sterling.

169
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The pound sterling.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Pound sterling.

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And I think that has to do with weight, I'm sure.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But here we've got it divided into small and large quantities.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So where we have coins, we might have pence.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sounds like cents.

175
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right, exactly.

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I think actually the penny might come from the British term pence.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sure it does, they're very similar and the meaning is basically one hundredth of a pound.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right, exactly.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And the pound is basically what you would say in the US, a dollar, a pound is the currency of England.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But actually, you know how in the United States people would say, you know, a hundred bucks, which would be a hundred dollars, over there they say one hundred quid.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Quid.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So yeah, this is actually important slang.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In America I would spend five bucks at the movies, in Britain I would spend five quid, and now that's a slang term for one pound.

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And actually I've heard also like fifty p, which I think means fifty cents.

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, pence.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Pence.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, so fifty p.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So you could say this stick of, or this pack of gum costs fifty p, so fifty pence.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's right.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Half of a pound.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, as you can see, obviously the currencies are different, but also it is interesting to learn the way that you would say it locally, so, you know, next time if you are in Britain or you're talking to an English person, then you'd know if they say, you know, fifty quid, you understand they're talking about fifty pounds.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So, but they don't use the euro over there.

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, they don't, not in Great Britain, they do use the euro on the continents of France, Italy, and the euro is the name of that currency.

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay.

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright, so a lot of great stuff, and now lastly, although we saw it at the beginning of the dialogue, let's talk about what this person wants to do.

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He wants to change these coins into bills.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So the verb when you need to exchange money is to change money.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So let's say if I go to England and all I have is dollars, I would say I want to change money.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay, you could also say exchange, but when we're speaking to one another, we normally just say change.

202
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Right.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Right, because even the places are sometimes called like money changers, you know, they say that or something like that.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Exactly, and so if I want to change money, that means I want to maybe change dollars for euros or dollars for pounds, but this also can mean I want to change a dollar for some quarters.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right, right.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Because I need quarters for like a laundry machine or a telephone.

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right, and I've heard also the term is to break, so if maybe you have a ten dollar bill and you need maybe a five dollar bill, but you don't have one, you ask the person to break that money, so you say, can you break this bill?

208
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yeah, and that actually makes sense because a bill, normally you break something that's big into smaller pieces, so if you think about it, if I break a glass, it becomes many pieces.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, if I break a five dollar bill, I want maybe one dollars, I get five of those, there's one piece and then it breaks into many pieces, so to break means to ask for smaller change.

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So maybe next time you guys need change, you can go up to someone and say, excuse me, can you change this five dollar bill for me or can you break this five dollar bill for me?

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
All right, so a lot of interesting language, very useful stuff, let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Help me organize these coins.

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's a lot of money.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What'd you do?

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Break the piggy bank?

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, I'm going to go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Great, then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

221
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I found some coins that are not from here.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have like 90 pence, but it won't add up to one pound.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Hopefully.

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All right, coming back to the topic now, you seem to know a lot about this stuff, let's test your knowledge here.

227
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
On the $100 bill, who do we find?

228
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What president or what person?

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Benjamin Franklin.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's right, but he wasn't a president, right?

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He was not.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He was a very important figure in American history.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Many people are familiar with the story of Benjamin Franklin and the kite with the key on it, so he discovered electricity.

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's right, that's right.

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He was a very important inventor and also an important person when it comes to the creation of America.

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's right.

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Now, the smaller of the bills would be the $1 bill, and actually now you have a $1 coin as well, but on the $1 bill, do you know who's on there?

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think it's George Washington also, right?

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think so, yeah.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He's on the quarter and on the $1 bill.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We like to recycle our presidents.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The $20 bill then would be Abraham Lincoln, right?

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right.

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They're actually on ...

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's sort of unfair, though.

246
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Favorite presidents in the United States, so yeah.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But they haven't changed over time.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:19,000
In other countries, you see that they change according to the important person that's in government, or maybe like, for example, in China, you have Chairman Mao on there, which before you didn't, or in England, you have Queen Elizabeth.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Before was the previous ruler, which I think was King George VI.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But in the US, you guys flat out, 100 years ago, these guys haven't changed them since then.

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, I think America likes to celebrate its creation.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Which is still a very young country, right?

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Right, 1776, so it's only been, what, 240 years.

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So yeah, the idea is basically that we celebrate the founding, so the beginning of the republic, and the men who are involved in that, they're called the founders.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:56,000
George Washington, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin.

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
These people were very important in the history of America, and that's why we celebrate them on our money.

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The one exception, of course, is Abraham Lincoln.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He was from the 1860s, as you remember.

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right, 16th president.

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's right.

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He was very important because of the Civil War, and a lot of the changes that later happened to our Constitution, and so he's another person who's maybe added on.

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So he's basically the last guy you guys kind of celebrate, because you don't have, I don't know...

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Right, or Bill Clinton, or something like this.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Not yet.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right, so I guess we gotta wait a while.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But that's very interesting, this history aspect of currencies is actually very, very interesting.

268
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It is, and one thing I'd like to add about quarters is that in the 2000s, so from 2000, I think, on, the United States started to make state quarters.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So you'll see oftentimes these quarters with the picture of a state, New Hampshire, Maryland, Illinois, California, and a special symbol of that state, and so these are special quarters from the last maybe 10 years or so.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, yeah, I remember seeing these because usually on the other side of the quarter one, on one side you had George Washington, on the other side you had the eagle, the emblem of the flag, I guess.

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Not the flag, but the national bird, or the republic.

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But now you have these states, and it says, you know, Delaware, and it has a little, maybe, I don't know, flower or something that's representative of these states.

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So that was actually very nice.

274
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It was a collector's type thing as well, right?

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
People were collecting these.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's right, you can collect all 50.

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Some people did that, and you still see them in use.

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So those are the state quarters, and those generally are newer quarters.

279
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay, interesting.

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
All right, guys, so we're out of time, but if you guys have any questions or doubts, you can find us at EnglishPod.com, and we'll see you guys there.

281
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Bye.

282
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Bye.
