1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Help me organize these coins.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's a lot of money.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What'd you do?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Break the piggy bank?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Great.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I found some coins that are not from here.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I have like 90 pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hopefully.
