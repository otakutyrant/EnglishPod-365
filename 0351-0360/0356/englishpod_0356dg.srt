1
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,099
Help me organize these coins.

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,560
That's a lot of money.

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:10,580
What'd you do?

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,560
Break the piggy bank?

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:16,539
Yeah, I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,320
Okay.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,079
I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:21,699
Great.

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,120
Then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.

10
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:26,500
I found some coins that are not from here.

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,399
Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London.

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,920
I have like 90 pence, but in all it won't add up to one pound.

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,619
Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?

14
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:35,140
Hopefully.
