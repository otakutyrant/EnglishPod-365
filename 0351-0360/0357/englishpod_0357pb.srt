00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today, Marco, we're trying to make some plans.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're trying to go to a restaurant, correct?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We want to go to a restaurant tonight.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But before, we have to call them to make sure that there is a space or room available for us.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
All right.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we're going to hear a conversation between a person at a restaurant who works there and a person who would like to go to that restaurant.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's take a listen.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at language takeaway.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Language takeaway.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So, first up, Marco, we didn't hear the word restaurant in today's dialogue.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We heard a different noun.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We heard this bistro.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The name of the restaurant is actually Bruno Bistro.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So this restaurant, the type of restaurant this is, it's actually a bistro.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So Bruno is a name, like Marco or Catherine, but Bistro is actually a special kind of small restaurant and I believe it comes from France, right?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So it's kind of small and intimate, maybe some candles and lots of wine, but it's not like a big restaurant.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's very romantic.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Right, right.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Which usually, I found it means that it's more expensive for some reason.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Because it's a bistro, it's automatically more expensive.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think maybe in America, it's more expensive.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Who knows?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Maybe in France, it's the cheap option, but bistro is the kind of place we're at and we'd like to go, so it's probably a popular place.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We need to make a reservation.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So as you see there, we have a verb there, to make.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We want to make a reservation.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So let's take a look at the noun, a reservation.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Reservation, reservation.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So this word means to ask the restaurant to hold your seats.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So you say, listen, I would like to come to your restaurant tonight.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want to wait when I come, so I will call in advance.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll call early and ask them to save a table for us.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So this is called making a reservation.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So it goes together.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You call to make a reservation or you want to make a reservation.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So the verb is to make.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So I could say, for example, hey Marco, can you please make a reservation for dinner tonight?

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm afraid there might not be any tables left if we wait.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Very good.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now we can use the verb reserve as well, right?

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So reservation is a noun.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
To reserve is a verb.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So I can say, hey Marco, can you please reserve a table for dinner tonight?

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So we can say to make a reservation or reserve a table, but you have to say reserve a table.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you can't say, I would like to reserve, please.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have to reserve something.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So if I'm going to a concert, a music concert, I can say, I'd like to reserve two seats for the concert.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But if I'm going to dinner, obviously we sit at a table.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I'm going to reserve a table.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Now moving on to another verb, the waiter or the person in charge there asked us how many people will attend dinner tonight?

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So how many people will attend?

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
To attend.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is another verb.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
To attend means to be there or to come.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So it's actually a nicer way of saying to come.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Instead of him saying, how many people will come tonight, he says, how many people will attend?

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All right.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So that's a question for the person making the reservation.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How many people total?

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But it's like you say, very polite.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You could say, hey, Marco, how many people do you think will attend your birthday party next week?

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Uh-huh.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I can say, well, maybe 10 people will attend.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Ten people will attend.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So attend.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Quite a simple verb, but just remember that it means to come or to be present at.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Great.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So let's take a look at our dialogue again, and then we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, hello.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I would like to make a reservation, please.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Certainly, sir.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
For which day and time, please?

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tonight at seven.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Very well.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And how many people will attend tonight?

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Four people.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mark.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We've picked out three phrases for you.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

105
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Fluency Builder.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All right.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So the first phrase we have on Fluency Builder is actually a phrase you don't want to hear when you're trying to make a reservation.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The person at the restaurant, the bistro, said, I'm sorry, we're fully booked until eight.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So a place that is fully booked or maybe a flight that's fully booked means that it's completely full.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There are no available seats or available spots or anything.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All the tables have been reserved.

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All right.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So this means that we have to change either the day or the time.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's right.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's fully booked.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But the nice thing is that after eight o'clock is not fully booked.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There are free tables after eight.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's right.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So he actually went on to say an interesting phrase to start that sentence.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He said, in that case, eight o'clock is fine.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In that case, so in that case is a great phrase to use when you're having a conversation with someone or a negotiation, because it's something that we say when the situation, OK, like reserving a table, is not exactly the way we hoped it would be.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So with today's dialogue, we wanted to book a table at seven o'clock.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There was no table.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So in that case, in that situation, because it changed from what we thought, we had to book a table at eight instead.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it's usually a response to information that was given to you.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So they say, oh, I'm sorry, there are no tickets available for the zoo today, only for tomorrow.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
In that case, why don't we go tomorrow?

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's right.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So I wanted to go today, but the situation changed or there's a problem.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In that case, let's change our plans.

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's right.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And lastly, the waiter asked, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What name I should make the reservation under?

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
All right.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Now, to make a reservation, we already learned this phrase.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It means to reserve a table.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now, to make a reservation under a person's name, this is quite different, right?

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This means that we're going to save a table, reserve a table, but we have to provide a name.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So if we say, OK, one table reserved for four, we don't know who.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So this is the name that you will give the waiter when you arrive at the restaurant.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's right.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So that is your table, basically, and that's your reservation.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So if you go to the restaurant, you say, hello, I have a reservation under the name of Mark.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I have a reservation under the name Mark or I have a reservation for Mark at eight o'clock.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now, when they ask the question, they're going to say, what name should we make the reservation under?

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's because...

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So just think about it as when they make the reservation, they have this big book.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They write your name, and underneath they write the time.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What name should we make the reservation under?

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's right.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,000
OK.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab and some really good phrases, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, hello.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I would like to make a reservation, please.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Certainly, sir.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
For which day and time, please?

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Tonight at seven.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Very well.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And how many people will attend tonight?

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Four people.

167
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Mark.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Language takeaway.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
All right, we're back.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So making a reservation.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Now, this is fairly easy.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is basically what you're going to experience if you call any restaurant to make a reservation, right?

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's right.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And it's really important to know how to respond because I know in other languages sometimes you reserve seats instead of tables.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And so in English we reserve or we book a table.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now sometimes you will call a place and you'll say, well, I'd like to make a reservation, and they will say, I'm sorry, we don't accept reservations.

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes, this is actually a very frustrating situation, especially if a restaurant or bistro is very popular.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Because if they don't accept reservations, we don't make reservations, that means that you have to go to the restaurant and maybe wait in line for a table.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's right.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's called, I think, first come, first served, right?

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's right.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
First come, first serve.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So that means that the first people to arrive at the restaurant are the first people to get a table.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So it's smart to arrive early.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So that's what happens now.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There are certain restaurants where you can't make a reservation or different.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We took a look at a bistro.

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
There's another one, like for example, very popular in the US, a diner.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
A diner.

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Now this is not a place you need to make a reservation for.

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Normally a diner is a very casual place to eat.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can go at 9 o'clock in the morning for breakfast.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not very fancy at all.

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And it's open, I think, 24 hours usually.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Many of them are open 24 hours and that's why I say it's not a place you need to worry about a reservation because they're usually popular at certain times, but like 7 o'clock for breakfast or, you know, 12 o'clock for lunch, but you can usually get a table.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
All right.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
