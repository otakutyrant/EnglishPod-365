00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:04,719
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:06,059
My name is Katherine.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,660
And today, Marco, we're trying to make some plans.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,179
We're trying to go to a restaurant, correct?

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:12,800
That's right.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,539
We want to go to a restaurant tonight.

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,859
But before, we have to call them to make sure that there is a space or room available for us.

9
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:21,280
All right.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,199
So we're going to hear a conversation between a person at a restaurant who works there and a person who would like to go to that restaurant.

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,260
Let's take a listen.

12
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,759
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at language takeaway.

13
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,340
Language takeaway.

14
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,500
So, first up, Marco, we didn't hear the word restaurant in today's dialogue.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,459
We heard a different noun.

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,739
We heard this bistro.

17
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:15,500
That's right.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,719
The name of the restaurant is actually Bruno Bistro.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,599
So this restaurant, the type of restaurant this is, it's actually a bistro.

20
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,299
That's right.

21
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:34,640
So Bruno is a name, like Marco or Catherine, but Bistro is actually a special kind of small restaurant and I believe it comes from France, right?

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:34,920
Right.

23
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:35,700
That's right.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,280
So it's kind of small and intimate, maybe some candles and lots of wine, but it's not like a big restaurant.

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,200
It's very romantic.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:43,980
Right, right.

27
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,140
Which usually, I found it means that it's more expensive for some reason.

28
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,560
Because it's a bistro, it's automatically more expensive.

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,299
I think maybe in America, it's more expensive.

30
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:53,680
Who knows?

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,760
Maybe in France, it's the cheap option, but bistro is the kind of place we're at and we'd like to go, so it's probably a popular place.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,459
We need to make a reservation.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,340
That's right.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,080
So as you see there, we have a verb there, to make.

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,180
We want to make a reservation.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,560
So let's take a look at the noun, a reservation.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,099
Reservation, reservation.

38
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,860
So this word means to ask the restaurant to hold your seats.

39
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,680
So you say, listen, I would like to come to your restaurant tonight.

40
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,979
I don't want to wait when I come, so I will call in advance.

41
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,699
I'll call early and ask them to save a table for us.

42
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,360
That's right.

43
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,699
So this is called making a reservation.

44
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,599
So it goes together.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,340
You call to make a reservation or you want to make a reservation.

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

47
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,560
So the verb is to make.

48
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,740
So I could say, for example, hey Marco, can you please make a reservation for dinner tonight?

49
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,539
I'm afraid there might not be any tables left if we wait.

50
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:56,780
Very good.

51
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:01,840
Now we can use the verb reserve as well, right?

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,699
That's right.

53
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,120
So reservation is a noun.

54
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,219
To reserve is a verb.

55
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:11,639
So I can say, hey Marco, can you please reserve a table for dinner tonight?

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:12,740
Okay.

57
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,860
So we can say to make a reservation or reserve a table, but you have to say reserve a table.

58
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,800
So you can't say, I would like to reserve, please.

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,500
No.

60
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,219
You have to reserve something.

61
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:31,120
So if I'm going to a concert, a music concert, I can say, I'd like to reserve two seats for the concert.

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,500
That's right.

63
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:34,020
But if I'm going to dinner, obviously we sit at a table.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,219
So I'm going to reserve a table.

65
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:36,879
All right.

66
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:47,360
Now moving on to another verb, the waiter or the person in charge there asked us how many people will attend dinner tonight?

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,659
So how many people will attend?

68
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,180
To attend.

69
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:50,639
Okay.

70
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,680
This is another verb.

71
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,419
To attend means to be there or to come.

72
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:57,780
That's right.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,500
So it's actually a nicer way of saying to come.

74
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:06,139
Instead of him saying, how many people will come tonight, he says, how many people will attend?

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,039
All right.

76
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,139
So that's a question for the person making the reservation.

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,240
How many people total?

78
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,699
But it's like you say, very polite.

79
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:21,040
You could say, hey, Marco, how many people do you think will attend your birthday party next week?

80
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:21,540
Uh-huh.

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,040
That's right.

82
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,000
So I can say, well, maybe 10 people will attend.

83
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,819
Ten people will attend.

84
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,220
So attend.

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,879
Quite a simple verb, but just remember that it means to come or to be present at.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:33,620
All right.

87
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:33,920
Great.

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,519
So let's take a look at our dialogue again, and then we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,439
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

90
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,360
Yes, hello.

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,019
I would like to make a reservation, please.

92
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,819
Certainly, sir.

93
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:52,100
For which day and time, please?

94
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,720
Tonight at seven.

95
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,879
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.

96
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,180
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.

97
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:00,160
Very well.

98
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,519
And how many people will attend tonight?

99
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,519
Four people.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,879
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

101
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,420
Mark.

102
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,000
All right.

103
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,579
We've picked out three phrases for you.

104
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,060
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

105
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,639
Fluency Builder.

106
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,040
All right.

107
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,019
So the first phrase we have on Fluency Builder is actually a phrase you don't want to hear when you're trying to make a reservation.

108
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,860
The person at the restaurant, the bistro, said, I'm sorry, we're fully booked until eight.

109
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:32,620
That's right.

110
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:39,480
So a place that is fully booked or maybe a flight that's fully booked means that it's completely full.

111
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,079
There are no available seats or available spots or anything.

112
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,819
All the tables have been reserved.

113
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:46,740
All right.

114
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,699
So this means that we have to change either the day or the time.

115
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:51,220
That's right.

116
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,240
It's fully booked.

117
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,800
But the nice thing is that after eight o'clock is not fully booked.

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
There are free tables after eight.

119
00:05:59,079 --> 00:05:59,399
That's right.

120
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,180
So he actually went on to say an interesting phrase to start that sentence.

121
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,560
He said, in that case, eight o'clock is fine.

122
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:24,560
In that case, so in that case is a great phrase to use when you're having a conversation with someone or a negotiation, because it's something that we say when the situation, OK, like reserving a table, is not exactly the way we hoped it would be.

123
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,959
So with today's dialogue, we wanted to book a table at seven o'clock.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,319
There was no table.

125
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:37,699
So in that case, in that situation, because it changed from what we thought, we had to book a table at eight instead.

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,180
That's right.

127
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,300
So it's usually a response to information that was given to you.

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,160
So they say, oh, I'm sorry, there are no tickets available for the zoo today, only for tomorrow.

129
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,959
In that case, why don't we go tomorrow?

130
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:53,720
That's right.

131
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:58,060
So I wanted to go today, but the situation changed or there's a problem.

132
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,439
In that case, let's change our plans.

133
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,339
That's right.

134
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:09,339
And lastly, the waiter asked, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

135
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,240
What name I should make the reservation under?

136
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,040
All right.

137
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,699
Now, to make a reservation, we already learned this phrase.

138
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,160
It means to reserve a table.

139
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:24,519
Now, to make a reservation under a person's name, this is quite different, right?

140
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:30,939
This means that we're going to save a table, reserve a table, but we have to provide a name.

141
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,879
So if we say, OK, one table reserved for four, we don't know who.

142
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:40,000
So this is the name that you will give the waiter when you arrive at the restaurant.

143
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,019
That's right.

144
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,860
So that is your table, basically, and that's your reservation.

145
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,180
So if you go to the restaurant, you say, hello, I have a reservation under the name of Mark.

146
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,019
That's right.

147
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,579
I have a reservation under the name Mark or I have a reservation for Mark at eight o'clock.

148
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,600
Now, when they ask the question, they're going to say, what name should we make the reservation under?

149
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:05,939
That's because...

150
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,180
So just think about it as when they make the reservation, they have this big book.

151
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,439
They write your name, and underneath they write the time.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,639
What name should we make the reservation under?

153
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,779
That's right.

154
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,379
OK.

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:23,920
So we've taken a look at a lot of vocab and some really good phrases, so let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

156
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,799
Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?

157
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:33,720
Yes, hello.

158
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,379
I would like to make a reservation, please.

159
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,179
Certainly, sir.

160
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,460
For which day and time, please?

161
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,080
Tonight at seven.

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,259
I'm sorry, sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.

163
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,539
In that case, eight o'clock is fine.

164
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,539
Very well.

165
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,879
And how many people will attend tonight?

166
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:47,899
Four people.

167
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,240
Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?

168
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:51,799
Mark.

169
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,919
Language takeaway.

170
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,419
All right, we're back.

171
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:02,700
So making a reservation.

172
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,080
Now, this is fairly easy.

173
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,379
This is basically what you're going to experience if you call any restaurant to make a reservation, right?

174
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,399
That's right.

175
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:17,539
And it's really important to know how to respond because I know in other languages sometimes you reserve seats instead of tables.

176
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,139
And so in English we reserve or we book a table.

177
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:31,340
Now sometimes you will call a place and you'll say, well, I'd like to make a reservation, and they will say, I'm sorry, we don't accept reservations.

178
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,840
Yes, this is actually a very frustrating situation, especially if a restaurant or bistro is very popular.

179
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,279
Right.

180
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:47,299
Because if they don't accept reservations, we don't make reservations, that means that you have to go to the restaurant and maybe wait in line for a table.

181
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:47,840
That's right.

182
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,980
That's called, I think, first come, first served, right?

183
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,600
That's right.

184
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,919
First come, first serve.

185
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,179
So that means that the first people to arrive at the restaurant are the first people to get a table.

186
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,519
So it's smart to arrive early.

187
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,320
That's right.

188
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,620
So that's what happens now.

189
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,440
There are certain restaurants where you can't make a reservation or different.

190
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,480
We took a look at a bistro.

191
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:14,500
There's another one, like for example, very popular in the US, a diner.

192
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,700
A diner.

193
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,580
Now this is not a place you need to make a reservation for.

194
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,940
Normally a diner is a very casual place to eat.

195
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:25,820
You can go at 9 o'clock in the morning for breakfast.

196
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,519
It's not very fancy at all.

197
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,679
And it's open, I think, 24 hours usually.

198
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:45,299
Many of them are open 24 hours and that's why I say it's not a place you need to worry about a reservation because they're usually popular at certain times, but like 7 o'clock for breakfast or, you know, 12 o'clock for lunch, but you can usually get a table.

199
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,539
All right.

200
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:52,539
