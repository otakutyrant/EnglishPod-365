1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
can I borrow five bucks?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on, I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Last time I lent you money you never paid me back.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I promise if you lend me five dollars today I will repay you in full next week.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Fine, can't believe you don't trust me.
