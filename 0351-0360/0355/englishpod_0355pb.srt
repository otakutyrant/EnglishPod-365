00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're tackling a very difficult issue for many English learners.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're talking about taking things from other people and giving them back.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So today we are going to talk about money, and we're going to lend money and borrow money.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And we're going to talk more about this after we listen to the dialogue.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Alright, so now let's take a look at that language on Language Takeaway.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Language Takeaway.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So first up we have the key verbs for today, the verb to borrow and to lend.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Now this is a really important difference to make because many people make this mistake where they use the wrong verb.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, if I ask you, Marco, can I borrow your bicycle?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That means can I take your bicycle from you, and then later I'll give it back, but I want to use it.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So the verb is kind of reflexive.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's going on to you.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You want to borrow, right?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I want to borrow.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I want to take it from you for a short time, and then I want to give it back.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So to borrow.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Right.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now the other verb is to lend, and that on the other hand goes from me to you.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So you borrow my bicycle.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I lend you my bicycle.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I give it to you.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So another way of asking can I borrow is can you lend me your bike?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That means can you act?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Can you do this thing for me?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So there's two different ways of saying it, and it's very important to remember who is doing what.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Exactly.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So remember the person taking is borrowing.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The person giving is lending.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So it's not correct to say, can you borrow me your bicycle?

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's not right.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can you lend me?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Can you lend me a hand?

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can you help me?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So remember this.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
To borrow is something I do.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I want to borrow from you.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's the person, the subject in a sentence, but in the case of lending, someone else is doing it.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So can you lend to me, or can you lend it to him?

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You have to say who it's being lent to.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Exactly.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And as you said, who it's being lent to, so the past tense of lend is lent.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, so Marco lent me his bike last week, and I broke it.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So now I have to pay him a lot of money.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You have to pay me five bucks, and that's our next word, bucks.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now this is a slang term, so this is something we say very casually in America when we want to talk about dollars.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So one buck is one dollar, a hundred bucks is a hundred dollars.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now as you said, it's very American.

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You wouldn't really use it like, I don't know if you're in Britain, you wouldn't say a hundred bucks.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, you would say quid.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Quid, yeah, exactly.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So they don't have dollars, so they don't say bucks.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Not in England.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Alright, very good.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So we wanted to borrow five dollars, and that person promised to pay you back on Tuesday.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Alright, so this is a lot like that verb to lend.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
To lend him, to pay you, you have to say who you're going to pay, right?

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So Marco, I'm sorry about your bicycle, I will pay you back tomorrow.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That means I will give you money for it tomorrow.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So if you borrow money, you have to pay it back.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, so I want to borrow five dollars, I promise I will pay you back Thursday.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Very good.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And now lastly, we will lend money, but of course we need a guarantee, we need something to make sure that you will pay me back.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So that's called collateral.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Alright, now collateral is important because sometimes you can't trust someone, like you say Marco.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And so, for example, if I want to rent a bicycle, so I want to use it for the day, maybe there's a store that they rent bicycles to people, I would give my passport or my driver's license as collateral because I will definitely return to take my driver's license or passport back.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So that's basically a sign of a promise, money or identification or some object.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So usually, for example, if you're going to get a very big loan at the bank, they will have to give them your house as collateral.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So you're saying if I can't pay you back, then you can take my house.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So collateral is the last word in language takeaway, but we do have some great phrases for you coming up in Fluency Builder.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Can I borrow five bucks?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come on, I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Last time I lent you money, you never paid me back.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I promise, if you lend me five dollars today, I will repay you in full next week.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Fine.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't believe you don't trust me.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's nothing personal.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Just business.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right, we're back.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So let's take a look at these phrases on Fluency Builder.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So Marco, these are two friends talking and the way they talk to each other is very casual, right?

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So we hear at the beginning, can I borrow five bucks?

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Right.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So what is this come on?

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Come on.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a persuasive phrase.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's one of those phrases where you're trying to convince or persuade people.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And you can use it as an interjection in many situations.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So for example here, come on, lend it to me.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Lend me some money.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll pay you back.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're trying to convince that person.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, exactly.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But what about this situation?

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm running late.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have to go.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And my friend, she's still sitting at her desk maybe at work and taking forever.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I say, come on, let's go.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's like hurry up.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Move it.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So it's a way of getting someone to do something.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You want them to follow you.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Exactly.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And now talking about money again, the person promised to repay the money.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He said, I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But then he also said, I will repay you in full next week.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In full.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Now remember, this is important.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I will repay you in full.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That means I won't repay you a little bit and then a little bit later.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will repay you everything next week.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Exactly.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So if you have to pay or repay someone in full, you have to give them the entire amount, not just a part of it.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
In full.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Full means everything.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And the final phrase is the very last line of today's dialogue.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's nothing personal.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's just business.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think this is a common phrase that people use when maybe doing business with friends or people you know, you know, maybe you're asking for collateral and the guy's like, I can't believe you don't trust me.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm your brother.

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And he's like, it's nothing personal.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's just business.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's a way to say, listen, this is not about you and me.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is about my rules.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And when I give something to someone, I always ask for collateral.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So it's just business.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just my way of doing this.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Exactly.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So it's a good phrase to use if you're doing maybe business with a friend.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And of course, maybe you're setting these rules and the friend, maybe your friend feels a little bit offended.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You say, hey, it's nothing personal.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's just business.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Nothing personal.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So that's the last phrase.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue again and we'll be right back.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can I borrow five bucks?

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Come on.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll pay you back on Tuesday.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Last time I lent you money, you never paid me back.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I promise if you lend me $5 today, I will repay you in full next week.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

158
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I'm taking your skateboard as collateral.

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Fine.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't believe you don't trust me.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's nothing personal.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Just business.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All right.

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So lending money, borrowing money.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Now, as we mentioned, sometimes you have people that ask you for money.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now, did you ever have that friend that always asked you for money and never repaid you?

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Like a dollar at a time.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hey, can I borrow a dollar?

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can I borrow five dollars?

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, always.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And actually this friend, he would borrow $10 and he would say, oh, I'll buy you a coffee tomorrow.

173
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I say, what?

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A $10 coffee?

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't think so.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So it was always uneven.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I paid more and he never repaid me in full.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah.

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And actually I think if you add up all that little amount of money that maybe some friends borrowed from you, it would be quite a decent amount.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I had many friends who would be like, hey, can I borrow a dollar?

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Or even like 25 cents at a time.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It would add up over time.

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
After a couple of years?

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's like a whole dinner.

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Exactly.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So what do you call these people?

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The word in English?

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's a slang word.

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's called a mooch.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A mooch, right.

193
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's a mooch.

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It means he's always taking money from people or asking other people to pay for his dinner or staying at someone's house.

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So a mooch is someone who tries to get things for free.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's exactly it.

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I had friends like this that would, for food as well, like maybe I brought my lunch.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is in school, obviously.

199
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And they would mooch off me like half my sandwich or half my juice.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can I have some chips?

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Can I have some juice?

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Exactly.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's mooch behavior.

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So that's the verb, to mooch off someone.

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah, to mooch off someone.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But it's also a noun.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's a mooch.

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's a mooch.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Very interesting stuff.

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Maybe you have a friend that was a mooch or maybe even yourself back in the day.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So let us know how it works in your country.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If you lend money to people, family members, do you ask for collateral?

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Or do you just forget about it?

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let us know.
