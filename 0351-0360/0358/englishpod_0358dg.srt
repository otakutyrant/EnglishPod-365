00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Why didn't you text me last night?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I sent you three or four messages.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I didn't get any of them.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Why didn't you just call?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I hate sending SMS messages.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I used it all up this month.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone it won't let me call or send messages.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No wonder you didn't get my texts.
