00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:07,400
EnglishPod.com Why didn't you text me last night?

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:08,060
What?

3
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:09,839
I sent you three or four messages.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,359
I didn't get any of them.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,820
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,320
Why didn't you just call?

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,320
I hate sending SMS messages.

8
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,719
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,800
I used it all up this month.

10
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:24,519
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,339
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone it won't let me call or send messages.

12
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,300
No wonder you didn't get my texts.
