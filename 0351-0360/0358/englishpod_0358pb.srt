00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and Marco, today we're talking about a very important part of daily life.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we're going to take a look at a lesson about technology and something that has become so popular and part of our everyday lives that it's necessary for us to acknowledge it in English.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we're talking about cellular phones, but not just cellular phones, something you can do and that many people often do on their cellular phones.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So before we get into that, let's listen to the dialogue, try to understand what it's all about, and we'll be back in a bit.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why didn't you text me last night?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I sent you three or four messages.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I didn't get any of them.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why didn't you just call?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I hate sending SMS messages.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I used it all up this month.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me call or send messages.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No wonder you didn't get my texts.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
All right, we're back.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Language takeaway.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
First up on language takeaway, we have the verb that is the focus of today's dialogue, to text.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So this is a verb in this case, to text.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Text me.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why didn't you text me?

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why didn't you text me?

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Now remember that text means other things in other situations.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here it's a verb.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a very new word as a verb from the last maybe 15 years or so with cell phones.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So that's actually what it means is to send a text message via cell phone.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So you send a message.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So you actually write the message, right?

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not a call.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When I call you, I talk to you.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
When you text someone, you actually write a message.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's very short and then you send it and the other person can read it.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So instead of saying, why didn't you send me a text message last night?

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We just say, why didn't you text me?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now another word that we often hear about texts is the noun messages or message.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So I sent you three or four messages.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So when we're talking about texting someone, what we're doing is sending a message.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A text message.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A text message.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right because we can send a voice message.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So voice is me talking, hi Marco, it's Catherine.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How are you doing?

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Right.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But a text message is actually words.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I write them out.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's right.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I don't see them.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But then we could actually use the verb form as well.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So we can say to text or we can say to message, why didn't you message me last night?

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So this is more slang, to message someone because text is very common and everyone uses it.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But normally young people say, hey, why didn't you message me or aren't you ever going to message me?

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right, right, right.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Or stop messaging in class.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So these are verbs to text and to message.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Now if we see down towards the middle of the dialogue, we see that the person hates sending SMS messages.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So it's kind of, you know, explaining already what's been said because you have SMS messages and this abbreviation stands for?

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Short Message Service.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Short S, Message M, Service S.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So Short Message Service, but most people around the world say SMS.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So they say, oh, send me an SMS or send me an SMS message, which again, like we see in the dialogue, it's kind of contradictory because we're already saying Short Message Service Message.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, but most people don't know what SMS means, so they just say, hey, send me an SMS message or send me a text message or I didn't get your SMS.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now lastly, we didn't get the SMS because we didn't have any credit on the phone.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right, now credit is an important word here.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a noun.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a thing.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We have credit or we don't have credit and it's important to remember that credit stands for money.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right, so maybe I buy $10 of credit for my cell phone and that means I can send many, many messages, but when I have zero credit, I can't send any messages.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So this is important because usually in many places, you have to have this amount of money in your phone in order to be able to talk and send messages.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So this money that you have is called credit, so you can say, I don't have any credit on my phone.

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right, and it's basically a way of having money without having real money.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You actually buy credit from your cell phone provider like AT&T or if you have China Telecom.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's who you buy credit from.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's right.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Very good.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why didn't you text me last night?

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I sent you three or four messages.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't get any of them.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why didn't you just call?

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I hate sending SMS messages.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I used it all up this month.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me call or send messages.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No wonder you didn't get my texts.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right, we've prepared three phrases for you.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's start with those now in Fluency Builder.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Fluency Builder.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So we're still talking about credit here.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now when you have credit, you can use it, but if you use all of it, we say you use it all up.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Right.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We used it up.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To use something up.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So here, what does the up do?

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Because we can use something, like I'm using my toothbrush, but to use up is different.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It means that you finished it.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It no longer exists.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it's completed.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I had credit.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I used it up.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That means it is gone.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Right, exactly.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So for example, maybe paint.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're painting a room, and you just used up all the white paint, right?

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So you used all the paint.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You have no more paint.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's gone, so it's all used up.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a very important phrase to remember.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's used up.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's right.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Now going back to SMS and messages, the question came up and said, I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
All right, so an unlimited SMS plan.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We know what SMS means, but first of all, let's talk about a plan.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because when we talk about cell phones, it's important to remember that some people buy credit.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's how they get service, but some people buy plans.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is very popular, by the way, in America.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is how most phones are.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What is a plan?

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So basically, it's just like any other service, like maybe internet.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You pay a monthly fee, and you get a certain amount of this service.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So maybe you pay $50, and you get 100 minutes to use on your cell phone, an unlimited amount of SMS.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:39,000
All right, so basically, my cell phone provider, AT&T or telecom, they will say, for this price, you get this much time, this many messages each month, and you have to keep paying it.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Normally, it's one year or two years that you have to commit.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You can't say, nah, I don't want this anymore.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Right, right, exactly.

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But the important thing here is that the person bought an unlimited SMS plan.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So this keyword there, unlimited, means it has no limit.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It means you can use it as much as you want.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So unlimited, no limits, that means you can do it as much as you want.

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can have unlimited calls, you can have unlimited SMS, you can have unlimited data, for example.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right, exactly.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Very good.

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And we end it with saying, well, no wonder you didn't get my text, well, because he didn't have credit.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No wonder you didn't get it.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right, no wonder is a great and very important phrase, and it's something we say when we finally understand why something happened.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right, we realize what happened.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So Marco, gosh, why didn't you respond to my calls?

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, I didn't have any credit.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No wonder, that means, oh, now I understand, no wonder.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Exactly, exactly.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So it's a great phrase to start off your sentence by explaining or letting the other person know that you finally understand why this happened, or you understand what the situation was.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All right, so let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Why didn't you text me last night?

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What?

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I sent you three or four messages.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I didn't get any of them.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was, and I never got your message.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why didn't you just call?

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I hate sending SMS messages.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, because I didn't have any credit on my phone.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I used it all up this month.

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan.

175
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I do, but if I don't have any credit in my phone, it won't let me call or send messages.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No wonder you didn't get my texts.

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right, we're back.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So, talking about messages and everything, do you send a lot of messages?

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Because I know some people who send like 100 messages a day.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, they're usually teenagers.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, I don't send 100 messages a day.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I mostly use messages.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't call people very often.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I find that messages are easier and cheaper, actually.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But I can't imagine sending 1,000 messages a day or 100 messages a day.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Your thumbs would get so tired.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, I remember, well, this is back in the day when you had the little Nokia phones and you didn't have the touch screens and all this stuff.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I did have some friends who were very, very agile with sending these messages, and some did send, I don't know, 100, 200 messages a day because it was that new way of communicating with people.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, it's very exciting.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I will also mention, and this is something that my parents complain about, there is something in America, and I'm sure in England as well, called text talk or text speak.

191
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And so because messages are short, people have started to change the way they spell or write words.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So instead of saying, F-O-R, this is for you, they write, this is number for you.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And it's so funny because you see these normal words but written in a strange new way.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And people who are older, I think my parents' age, and I do too to some extent, really don't like it because it's so different.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Right, it's especially very popular with the younger generation because it translates now to all sorts of messaging.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So before, as you say, it was because of the limitations, the amount of characters you could send in a message.

197
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But now it's just become something that people have gotten in the habit of doing.

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So for example, instead of writing skate, like skateboard, they would write S-K and then the number eight.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So skate.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's right, skate, skate.

201
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's so strange.

202
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And I know it actually happens in other languages as well.

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Italian, they do it a lot and Spanish, I'm sure as well.

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But we call it text speak because it's very, very short and kind of abbreviated.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But it's a problem from my understanding is because these younger generations, they use it so much that they really kind of start forgetting the proper grammar and proper spelling.

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So even you will find, I saw a report the other day, essays or reports handed in with these terrible writing, spelling mistakes.

207
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's awful.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, I hope, hope, hope that people are learning grammar and spelling, especially non-native learners of English.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So if you're doing homework for your English class, don't use these.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But it might be interesting to look them up.

211
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So let us know though, do you text message people?

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you send these text messages?

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you have SMS service in your country?

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let us know.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

216
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All right.

217
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We'll see you guys there.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Bye.
