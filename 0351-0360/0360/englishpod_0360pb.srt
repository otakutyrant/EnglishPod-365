00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're talking about some very interesting stories.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to learn some words for stories or tales.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But specifically, what kind of stories, Marco?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They're popular stories that you hear maybe through emails or maybe in your town.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's some particular story about maybe a ghost or many different things that they're kind of hard to believe but that happened a long time ago and people still talk about today.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And they're scary.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, they're kind of scary.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue, hear some interesting stories, and when we come back, we'll be talking more about what these words and phrases mean.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you mean?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then they're sold on the black market.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't be so gullible.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They are just urban legends.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They are just stories people make up to scare you.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you played them backwards.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Can you believe that?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't be so naive.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, maybe you are right.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens, which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at language takeaway.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So here on language takeaway today, we have some words that will help us understand the dialogue.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The first word is drugged.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I was reading about how some people get drugged in their hotel rooms.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So if you get drugged, it means that someone gave you some drugs in order to make you sleepy or in order for you to not remember what happened.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, so he was drugged means someone gave him a drug, something that made him go to sleep.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Right.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And it's not necessarily always a bad thing because obviously if you go to the hospital, the doctor may drug you in order to, you know, so you don't feel so much pain or something.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Exactly.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you're in an accident, you're in a lot of pain, the doctor drugs you so you don't feel that pain.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, so he was drugged.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This person is drugged.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And then what happens?

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, his organs were removed.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All right.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So organ, an organ is a noun, it's a thing.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Those are actually the things that are inside our body.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So your heart, liver, your pancreas, kidneys, etc.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
These are all organs.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And this is basically the category for the part of the body.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's anything really inside your body that has a function.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, so this is supposedly this story is that people, you know, usually tourists, they get tricked or drugged, and then they get their organs removed.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now what kind of a story is this, Marco?

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because it's not just a normal story.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All of these stories that we saw in the dialogue are called urban legends.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, urban has to do with cities, right?

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Legend is a story that may or may not be true.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It comes from a long time ago.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So an urban legend is actually a story that is probably not true, that you hear from other people like your friends.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's right.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So usually most of these stories fall under this category, you know, they're urban legends.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You don't really know if they're true, but people say it happened to a friend of theirs from a long time ago or stuff like that.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So a friend of a friend of a friend of mine told me that in hotels, sometimes they take your organs.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, obviously, that's not right.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All right.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So after that, we have two great adjectives for describing people who like to believe stories like this.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What are those two adjectives?

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, we have the adjective to be gullible, and to be naive.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Alright, so they're a little bit different to be gullible means to believe everything that people tell you, right?

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So if you're gullible, you pretty much believe anything you see or you hear.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So maybe your friend says, did you know Michael Jordan is coming to the office tomorrow?

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And you believe it, then you're very, very gullible.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Very gullible.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You believe what people tell you.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But naive is similar.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's similar, but I guess it has a little bit of a different meaning in the sense that it's not that you're so gullible, but you wholeheartedly trust people.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So you're naive, you're innocent.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're innocent.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Maybe you don't have a lot of life experience.

84
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So you trust people, and you can call a person naive, you say, well, he's very naive about these kinds of things.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I guess that's the main key, right, or the main point is that you don't really have too much life experience.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So that's why you're naive.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And just be careful, because gullible and naive are things that we say about people, but they're not nice things.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
They're not compliments.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right, right.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So you shouldn't really say it to someone directly, like in the dialogue.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Exactly.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Maybe as a joke, but not seriously.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So we have the great adjectives, way to describe people.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And lastly, we also have something else that, how to describe the situation, maybe it's too far-fetched, it's too difficult to believe.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So far-fetched, this is a great word, it means basically that something is very difficult to believe, like you say.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
For example, the story about Michael Jordan.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Michael Jordan is coming tomorrow, you say, oh, that's pretty far-fetched, means I don't really think that could happen.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So something that is far-fetched is difficult to happen or very, very unlikely to happen.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Very unlikely.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, very good.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We saw five key words there.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What do you mean?

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed, then they're sold on the black market.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't be so gullible, they are just urban legends.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They are just stories people make up to scare you.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you believe that?

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't be so naive.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
All right, let's take a look now at a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now on Fluency Builder today, we're going to start out with the story about organs.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's this urban legend.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now what happens when the organ is taken, the story says that it's sold on the black market.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So you probably hear this in the news or a lot of places.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The black market basically, it's not really a physical place, but it's where things are sold illegally.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So guns, organs, stuff like that.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Exactly.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So the black market, like you say, is not a place you can go to.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's an idea.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And it's basically anything that's illegal that's being sold, like guns are often sold on the black market.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right.

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sometimes, stolen cars are sold on the black market.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Also, organs can be sold on the black market, and this is a serious problem because obviously all of this is illegal.

132
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's right.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So the black market is where all this happens.

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Now moving on to the next urban legend that we actually didn't really talk about too much is how many people believe that popular songs have subliminal or satanic messages in them.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
All right, so let's take a look at the word subliminal first.

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We all know what a message is, right?

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's something that's told to us.

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But a subliminal message is something that is told to us without us knowing.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So it goes into your mind, but you don't even know it, right?

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So it's something that a lot of people believe in because they think that marketing people or big businesses are trying to control our behavior.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I could say very quietly, Marco, buy me dinner, buy me dinner.

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And that's a subliminal message.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Marco says, hey, I was thinking about getting everyone dinner tonight.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And then that's basically a way to control your actions.

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's right.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So whether or not this is possible.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's another discussion.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's another discussion.

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So yeah, that's basically what a lot of people say that some TV commercials or ads have these subliminal messages that are trying to convince you or persuade you into maybe consuming that product.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But they're a little bit different from satanic messages.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's right.

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So that's basically dealing with Satan or the devil.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So the idea that there are satanic messages means that they're messages about the devil, about how maybe God does not exist or like, you know, that you should do evil, not good.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So they're very dark and very kind of angry messages.

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think they talk about, for example, I'm not sure which song it is, but like by Ozzy Osbourne that if you play it backwards, supposedly there's this message that says, you know, worship the devil and stuff like that.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So that's where these urban legends come from.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But obviously it's it's either coincidence or not.

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Not true, right?

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's right.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So we've got these messages that are also an urban legend.

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But the final one is about KFC.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So KFC would be Kentucky Fried Chicken.

167
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And what is the legend?

168
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The legend is about their their food.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They say that they don't really have real chickens that, well, they take chickens and they they just, you know, super, super grow them.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The chickens are super grown in order for them to get bigger and faster.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And that's basically that they don't really even really have heads.

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They just, you know, have some hoses that go into their bodies and feed them.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And in four weeks you have a chicken.

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's disgusting.

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's disgusting.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's the idea is, yes, super grown chickens.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And so they're basically they're not real chickens, right?

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's what the legend says, is that they're not I mean, they really are, but they're not like naturally grown.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You know, usually a chicken takes three months to grow or something.

181
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's disgusting.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't even want to talk about that.

185
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But the idea of super growing is like using chemicals to do something that's not natural.

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right.

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Chemicals or hormones and stuff.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So that's they use it, for example, on plants.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can super grow a plant by adding fertilizer and vitamins and stuff to the soil that makes it grow faster.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Or maybe you have bigger carrots than normal, bigger potatoes because they're super grown.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right.

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
All right.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's a lot of great stuff.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What do you mean?

199
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed, then they're sold on the black market.

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't be so gullible.

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They are just urban legends.

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They're just stories people make up to scare you.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards.

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can you believe that?

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't be so naive.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

209
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All right.

211
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So all these urban legends, they are obviously most of them, if not all of them, are untrue.

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But they're very popular.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why do you think that is?

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think people like to believe these stories.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They're gossipy, you know.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
They're scary.

217
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You get to make your friends kind of nervous about stuff.

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But I think also we don't trust a lot of these things because we've heard for years and years and years and years about subliminal messages and marketing strategies or about these kind of hidden messages in songs.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So there's part of us that wants to believe them, but the other part is that you hear it enough, you start to believe it.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because I was reading up on a couple of them, and the most recent ones are about how they make the connection about how Nostradamus predicted the 9-11 incident, or how Coca-Cola is actually the one that invented Santa Claus, and even this KFC one where people just believe a lot of different things.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I even found one, the urban legend, about be careful when you go to the movie theater because there might be a syringe or something on the seat that if you sit down, it infects you with AIDS or something like this.

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So there's so many of them out there that if you think about it, they don't even really make sense.

223
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They don't.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And I understand that sometimes there'll be one news story, like about a needle in a candy box, and all of a sudden people say, well, don't eat candy because there's needles in candy boxes.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Right, exactly.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And obviously, you know, a one-time event turns into this massive kind of craze.

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But it is interesting, especially with this whole topic of subliminal messages.

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I do remember that actually there was a marketing campaign that was banned in movie theaters when the previews before the actual movie came on, they supposedly they had the sound or maybe on the screen, somebody opening up a Coke can, and the smell of Coke actually coming into the theater.

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And that was kind of like subliminal marketing, making people want to go get a Coke.

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Definitely.

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well, we used to pump the exhaust from the popcorn maker when I worked in a movie theater throughout the lobby.

233
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There you go.

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So everyone smells it, and it smells so good.

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Everyone wants to buy it.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You want to buy a popcorn?

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh yeah, we would totally use that.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So yeah, that is a way of like, I guess it is subliminal because you're not directly telling them to buy it, but you are just giving them all the...

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're suggesting it through audio or visual or oratory cues.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Right, and then you have the opportunity to sell them the most expensive popcorn they'll ever buy.

241
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Exactly.

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
$12 for a bag of popcorn.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
All right, so it's a very interesting topic.

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
