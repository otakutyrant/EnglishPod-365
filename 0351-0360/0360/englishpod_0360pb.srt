00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,439
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:05,419
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,099
And today we're talking about some very interesting stories.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:13,099
We're going to learn some words for stories or tales.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,019
But specifically, what kind of stories, Marco?

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,820
They're popular stories that you hear maybe through emails or maybe in your town.

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:33,579
There's some particular story about maybe a ghost or many different things that they're kind of hard to believe but that happened a long time ago and people still talk about today.

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,359
And they're scary.

10
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:35,500
Yeah, they're kind of scary.

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:42,500
So let's listen to today's dialogue, hear some interesting stories, and when we come back, we'll be talking more about what these words and phrases mean.

12
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,399
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,420
What do you mean?

14
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,380
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed.

15
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,299
Then they're sold on the black market.

16
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,560
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

17
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,019
Don't be so gullible.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,340
They are just urban legends.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,099
They are just stories people make up to scare you.

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,019
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you played them backwards.

21
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,439
Can you believe that?

22
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,400
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

23
00:01:21,819 --> 00:01:22,700
Don't be so naive.

24
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,659
Well, maybe you are right.

25
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,060
But how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens, which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

27
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,780
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at language takeaway.

28
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,599
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,799
So here on language takeaway today, we have some words that will help us understand the dialogue.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,400
The first word is drugged.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,719
So I was reading about how some people get drugged in their hotel rooms.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,500
That's right.

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:08,139
So if you get drugged, it means that someone gave you some drugs in order to make you sleepy or in order for you to not remember what happened.

34
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,919
All right, so he was drugged means someone gave him a drug, something that made him go to sleep.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,419
Right.

36
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:25,319
And it's not necessarily always a bad thing because obviously if you go to the hospital, the doctor may drug you in order to, you know, so you don't feel so much pain or something.

37
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:25,860
Exactly.

38
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,759
If you're in an accident, you're in a lot of pain, the doctor drugs you so you don't feel that pain.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,360
That's right.

40
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,379
All right, so he was drugged.

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,819
This person is drugged.

42
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,879
And then what happens?

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,280
Well, his organs were removed.

44
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,219
All right.

45
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,560
So organ, an organ is a noun, it's a thing.

46
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,400
Those are actually the things that are inside our body.

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:44,819
Right.

48
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,939
So your heart, liver, your pancreas, kidneys, etc.

49
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:48,979
These are all organs.

50
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,719
And this is basically the category for the part of the body.

51
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,800
It's anything really inside your body that has a function.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,599
Okay, so this is supposedly this story is that people, you know, usually tourists, they get tricked or drugged, and then they get their organs removed.

53
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,060
Now what kind of a story is this, Marco?

54
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,979
Because it's not just a normal story.

55
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,419
All of these stories that we saw in the dialogue are called urban legends.

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,039
Okay, urban has to do with cities, right?

57
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,659
Legend is a story that may or may not be true.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,099
That's right.

59
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,340
It comes from a long time ago.

60
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:22,740
Right.

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,639
So an urban legend is actually a story that is probably not true, that you hear from other people like your friends.

62
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,319
That's right.

63
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:36,300
So usually most of these stories fall under this category, you know, they're urban legends.

64
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,460
You don't really know if they're true, but people say it happened to a friend of theirs from a long time ago or stuff like that.

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,319
Exactly.

66
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,120
So a friend of a friend of a friend of mine told me that in hotels, sometimes they take your organs.

67
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,740
Well, obviously, that's not right.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,139
Right.

69
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:52,879
All right.

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,360
So after that, we have two great adjectives for describing people who like to believe stories like this.

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,840
What are those two adjectives?

72
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:05,900
Well, we have the adjective to be gullible, and to be naive.

73
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:13,020
Alright, so they're a little bit different to be gullible means to believe everything that people tell you, right?

74
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,740
So if you're gullible, you pretty much believe anything you see or you hear.

75
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,660
So maybe your friend says, did you know Michael Jordan is coming to the office tomorrow?

76
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,040
And you believe it, then you're very, very gullible.

77
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,639
Very gullible.

78
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,259
You believe what people tell you.

79
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,160
But naive is similar.

80
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:39,100
It's similar, but I guess it has a little bit of a different meaning in the sense that it's not that you're so gullible, but you wholeheartedly trust people.

81
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,579
So you're naive, you're innocent.

82
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:41,540
You're innocent.

83
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,600
Maybe you don't have a lot of life experience.

84
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,339
So you trust people, and you can call a person naive, you say, well, he's very naive about these kinds of things.

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,899
I guess that's the main key, right, or the main point is that you don't really have too much life experience.

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,899
So that's why you're naive.

87
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:58,560
That's right.

88
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,420
And just be careful, because gullible and naive are things that we say about people, but they're not nice things.

89
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,560
They're not compliments.

90
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,519
Right, right.

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,740
So you shouldn't really say it to someone directly, like in the dialogue.

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,339
Exactly.

93
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,639
Maybe as a joke, but not seriously.

94
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,220
So we have the great adjectives, way to describe people.

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:26,120
And lastly, we also have something else that, how to describe the situation, maybe it's too far-fetched, it's too difficult to believe.

96
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,319
So far-fetched, this is a great word, it means basically that something is very difficult to believe, like you say.

97
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,800
For example, the story about Michael Jordan.

98
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,740
Michael Jordan is coming tomorrow, you say, oh, that's pretty far-fetched, means I don't really think that could happen.

99
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,000
So something that is far-fetched is difficult to happen or very, very unlikely to happen.

100
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:48,800
Very unlikely.

101
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,399
Okay.

102
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,899
So, very good.

103
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,560
We saw five key words there.

104
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,879
Let's take a break and listen to the dialogue again.

105
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,660
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

106
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,699
What do you mean?

107
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:13,579
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed, then they're sold on the black market.

108
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,860
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

109
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:18,620
Don't be so gullible, they are just urban legends.

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,360
They are just stories people make up to scare you.

111
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:27,300
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards.

112
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,699
Can you believe that?

113
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,680
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

114
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:35,980
Don't be so naive.

115
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:43,319
Well, maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

116
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,259
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,560
All right, let's take a look now at a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

118
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,540
Now on Fluency Builder today, we're going to start out with the story about organs.

119
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,139
It's this urban legend.

120
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,720
Now what happens when the organ is taken, the story says that it's sold on the black market.

121
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,500
That's right.

122
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,779
So you probably hear this in the news or a lot of places.

123
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:24,019
The black market basically, it's not really a physical place, but it's where things are sold illegally.

124
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,779
So guns, organs, stuff like that.

125
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,399
Exactly.

126
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,620
So the black market, like you say, is not a place you can go to.

127
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,540
It's an idea.

128
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:38,560
And it's basically anything that's illegal that's being sold, like guns are often sold on the black market.

129
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:39,180
That's right.

130
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,279
Sometimes, stolen cars are sold on the black market.

131
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:49,500
Also, organs can be sold on the black market, and this is a serious problem because obviously all of this is illegal.

132
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,300
That's right.

133
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,060
So the black market is where all this happens.

134
00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:07,439
Now moving on to the next urban legend that we actually didn't really talk about too much is how many people believe that popular songs have subliminal or satanic messages in them.

135
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:10,399
All right, so let's take a look at the word subliminal first.

136
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,899
We all know what a message is, right?

137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,360
It's something that's told to us.

138
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,079
But a subliminal message is something that is told to us without us knowing.

139
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:19,819
That's right.

140
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:23,300
So it goes into your mind, but you don't even know it, right?

141
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:32,940
So it's something that a lot of people believe in because they think that marketing people or big businesses are trying to control our behavior.

142
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:33,559
That's right.

143
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:39,299
So I could say very quietly, Marco, buy me dinner, buy me dinner.

144
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,679
And that's a subliminal message.

145
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:43,039
Marco says, hey, I was thinking about getting everyone dinner tonight.

146
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,899
And then that's basically a way to control your actions.

147
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,240
That's right.

148
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,679
So whether or not this is possible.

149
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,360
That's another discussion.

150
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:51,179
That's another discussion.

151
00:08:51,500 --> 00:09:04,019
So yeah, that's basically what a lot of people say that some TV commercials or ads have these subliminal messages that are trying to convince you or persuade you into maybe consuming that product.

152
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,259
But they're a little bit different from satanic messages.

153
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,159
That's right.

154
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,740
So that's basically dealing with Satan or the devil.

155
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,419
That's right.

156
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:26,980
So the idea that there are satanic messages means that they're messages about the devil, about how maybe God does not exist or like, you know, that you should do evil, not good.

157
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,340
Right.

158
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,820
So they're very dark and very kind of angry messages.

159
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:44,500
I think they talk about, for example, I'm not sure which song it is, but like by Ozzy Osbourne that if you play it backwards, supposedly there's this message that says, you know, worship the devil and stuff like that.

160
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,700
So that's where these urban legends come from.

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,419
But obviously it's it's either coincidence or not.

162
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,860
Not true, right?

163
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,559
That's right.

164
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,220
So we've got these messages that are also an urban legend.

165
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,159
But the final one is about KFC.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,539
So KFC would be Kentucky Fried Chicken.

167
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,299
And what is the legend?

168
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,419
The legend is about their their food.

169
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:05,980
That's right.

170
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:15,019
They say that they don't really have real chickens that, well, they take chickens and they they just, you know, super, super grow them.

171
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,860
The chickens are super grown in order for them to get bigger and faster.

172
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,039
And that's basically that they don't really even really have heads.

173
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:27,059
They just, you know, have some hoses that go into their bodies and feed them.

174
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,480
And in four weeks you have a chicken.

175
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,159
That's disgusting.

176
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,639
That's disgusting.

177
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,840
It's the idea is, yes, super grown chickens.

178
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,740
And so they're basically they're not real chickens, right?

179
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,100
That's what the legend says, is that they're not I mean, they really are, but they're not like naturally grown.

180
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,600
You know, usually a chicken takes three months to grow or something.

181
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,120
Yeah.

182
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,419
All right.

183
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,139
That's disgusting.

184
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,320
I don't even want to talk about that.

185
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,379
But the idea of super growing is like using chemicals to do something that's not natural.

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:56,940
That's right.

187
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,340
That's right.

188
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,600
Chemicals or hormones and stuff.

189
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,600
So that's they use it, for example, on plants.

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,779
You can super grow a plant by adding fertilizer and vitamins and stuff to the soil that makes it grow faster.

191
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,440
Or maybe you have bigger carrots than normal, bigger potatoes because they're super grown.

192
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:11,980
That's right.

193
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:12,840
So.

194
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,320
All right.

195
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,799
That's a lot of great stuff.

196
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,019
Let's take a listen to the dialogue one last time.

197
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,940
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

198
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:27,919
What do you mean?

199
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,840
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed, then they're sold on the black market.

200
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,100
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

201
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,559
Don't be so gullible.

202
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:39,879
They are just urban legends.

203
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:42,639
They're just stories people make up to scare you.

204
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,580
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards.

205
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,960
Can you believe that?

206
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,940
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

207
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,220
Don't be so naive.

208
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:04,580
Well, maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

209
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:07,539
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?

210
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,600
All right.

211
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,240
So all these urban legends, they are obviously most of them, if not all of them, are untrue.

212
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,539
But they're very popular.

213
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,399
Why do you think that is?

214
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,820
I think people like to believe these stories.

215
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,440
They're gossipy, you know.

216
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,700
They're scary.

217
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,759
You get to make your friends kind of nervous about stuff.

218
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:40,639
But I think also we don't trust a lot of these things because we've heard for years and years and years and years about subliminal messages and marketing strategies or about these kind of hidden messages in songs.

219
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,340
So there's part of us that wants to believe them, but the other part is that you hear it enough, you start to believe it.

220
00:12:45,720 --> 00:13:07,179
Because I was reading up on a couple of them, and the most recent ones are about how they make the connection about how Nostradamus predicted the 9-11 incident, or how Coca-Cola is actually the one that invented Santa Claus, and even this KFC one where people just believe a lot of different things.

221
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:18,080
I even found one, the urban legend, about be careful when you go to the movie theater because there might be a syringe or something on the seat that if you sit down, it infects you with AIDS or something like this.

222
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,419
So there's so many of them out there that if you think about it, they don't even really make sense.

223
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,200
They don't.

224
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:34,899
And I understand that sometimes there'll be one news story, like about a needle in a candy box, and all of a sudden people say, well, don't eat candy because there's needles in candy boxes.

225
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,620
Right, exactly.

226
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,039
And obviously, you know, a one-time event turns into this massive kind of craze.

227
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,139
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

228
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:49,000
But it is interesting, especially with this whole topic of subliminal messages.

229
00:13:49,279 --> 00:14:13,399
I do remember that actually there was a marketing campaign that was banned in movie theaters when the previews before the actual movie came on, they supposedly they had the sound or maybe on the screen, somebody opening up a Coke can, and the smell of Coke actually coming into the theater.

230
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,580
And that was kind of like subliminal marketing, making people want to go get a Coke.

231
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,059
Definitely.

232
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:25,240
Well, we used to pump the exhaust from the popcorn maker when I worked in a movie theater throughout the lobby.

233
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,259
There you go.

234
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,299
So everyone smells it, and it smells so good.

235
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,360
Everyone wants to buy it.

236
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:29,779
You want to buy a popcorn?

237
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:31,279
Oh yeah, we would totally use that.

238
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:38,879
So yeah, that is a way of like, I guess it is subliminal because you're not directly telling them to buy it, but you are just giving them all the...

239
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,379
You're suggesting it through audio or visual or oratory cues.

240
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,240
Right, and then you have the opportunity to sell them the most expensive popcorn they'll ever buy.

241
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:48,980
Exactly.

242
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,879
$12 for a bag of popcorn.

243
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,039
All right, so it's a very interesting topic.

244
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,919
Let us know if you have any comments or questions about it.
