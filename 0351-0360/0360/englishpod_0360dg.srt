EnglishPod.com Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What do you mean?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then they're sold on the black market.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't be so gullible.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They are just urban legends.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They are just stories people make up to scare you.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Can you believe that?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Don't be so naive.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?
