EnglishPod.com Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?

2
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:10,859
What do you mean?

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,839
I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed.

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,739
Then they're sold on the black market.

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,019
Don't tell me you actually believe all that.

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,480
Don't be so gullible.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,800
They are just urban legends.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,559
They are just stories people make up to scare you.

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:31,480
Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,899
Can you believe that?

11
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,859
You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song?

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,159
Don't be so naive.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,500
Well, maybe you are right, but how about the story about how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster?

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,439
Sounds a bit too far-fetched to be true, don't you think?
