00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Hey Jordan is that you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Long time no see.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh hey, no kidding.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So how you been?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Settling into college life okay?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, I think so.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What about you?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What have you been up to?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, not much.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That sounds smart but kinda boring.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, it is a little bit.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I joined the great outdoors club though, which has been a lot of fun.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's cool.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Definitely pre-med.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What about you?

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major until our sophomore year.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I've got time.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oops!

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm late for class.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Gotta run.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Okay, take care.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey, nice running into you.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, you too.
