00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,140
EnglishPod.com Hey Jordan is that you?

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,240
Long time no see.

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:10,660
Oh hey, no kidding.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,699
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,480
So how you been?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,260
Settling into college life okay?

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:18,719
Yeah, I think so.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,800
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,679
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

10
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,920
Yeah, yeah, I know.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,039
It's got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

12
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,119
What about you?

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,320
What have you been up to?

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,659
Well, not much.

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,719
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

16
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,899
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,500
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,679
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,659
That sounds smart but kinda boring.

20
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,719
Yeah, it is a little bit.

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,659
I joined the great outdoors club though, which has been a lot of fun.

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,700
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

23
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,739
That's cool.

24
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,200
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,299
Definitely pre-med.

26
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:11,280
What about you?

27
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:16,760
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major until our sophomore year.

28
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,680
So I've got time.

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,260
Oops!

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,219
I'm late for class.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,879
Gotta run.

32
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:20,959
Okay, take care.

33
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,760
Hey, nice running into you.

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Yeah, you too.
