00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about American education and college life.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is actually a user suggestion that they wanted to know more or less what it would be like a dialogue between friends on a typical day in college.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All right.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So this is an advanced level lesson.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We're going to be talking in a normal conversational speed.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're going to listen to the dialogue, and when we come back, we'll talk about some of these key phrases and words that might help you understand the dialogue better.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, Jordan, is that you?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Long time no see.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, hey, no kidding.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So how you been?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Settling into college life okay?

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, I think so.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What about you?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What have you been up to?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, not much.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, it is a little bit.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I joined the great outdoors club though, which has been a lot of fun.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's cool.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Definitely pre-med.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What about you?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So I've got time.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oops, I'm late for class.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gotta run.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Take care.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hey, nice running into you.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, you too.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
All right, we're back.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So now let's start with all these words and phrases on language takeaway.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Language takeaway.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, hey Jordan, is that you?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Long time no see.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I love this phrase.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right, this phrase long time no see, which if you look at it, it doesn't really make sense.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It looks like we're missing a couple of words.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It looks like an incomplete sentence.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, like the subject.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who?

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I haven't seen you.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You haven't seen you.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So really the meaning of this is, I haven't seen you in a long time.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And actually I've heard that this phrase was taken from Chinese.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've also heard that.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So it's kind of like pigeon English.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And now it's very, very common in English to say this.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You say this with your friends.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's very casual.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And yeah, long time no see.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because if you translate this literally to Chinese, it makes sense, right?

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, it does.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So it's interesting.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we haven't seen our friend in a long time.

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And he's like, yeah, no kidding.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You know what?

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think it's been since orientation.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So what is this orientation that he's talking about?

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now this is an important part of the average American college experience.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Orientation is a special time, maybe for one week or a couple of days, at the very beginning of your first year of university.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So my first week of school, I didn't have any classes, but I went to school and with So all of the other first year students were called freshmen.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I had to do activities and meet people and sign up for classes.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And basically orientation is a time when you learn about a new system or a new program.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So how it works, because, you know, maybe you don't really know yet how to pick your classes or where the dorms are or how the meals work if you have to go to the cafeteria, etc.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right?

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And it comes from the verb to orient.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I orient myself by facing the right direction.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So orientation is really about teaching you how to start in a new system.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, very good.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So well, in that was three months ago, and a lot has happened.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Our speaker says that he pledged Phi Iota Alpha.

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So what is this to pledge in this now?

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is Greek as well.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Phi Iota Alpha is Greek.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And this means that we're talking about a fraternity.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So fraternity is a group of boys, a sorority is a group of girls.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And these are communities, so social societies, that you have to apply to be a member of.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So we don't say apply.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Right.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You pledge.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You pledge.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So it's like I pledge allegiance.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You say, I want to be in your group.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to be in your fraternity.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And so you will have to do special things to become a member.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So the verb to pledge would be to basically to promise something honorably or faithfully, right?

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Exactly.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And that's the nice way of putting it.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But generally, when you talk about sororities and fraternities, these upperclassmen, so third, fourth year students, they make the students who are pledging do very weird things.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So as you said, this is for these two guys.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is for a fraternity.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But if it's this type of club for girls, it's called a sorority.

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, so it's different.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So I'm pledging this sorority.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That means I'm trying to become a member of this sorority.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I think it's worthwhile mentioning many of you have probably seen it in movies, these fraternities or sororities, and they all have names based on the Greek alphabet.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So the letters Phi Iota Alpha or Kappa Kappa Gamma, these are the letters that basically represent the name of the fraternity.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And what's interesting is that maybe I am in Kappa Kappa Gamma at my school.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
There's another school with another Kappa Kappa Gamma.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We're all related.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's the same social community.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So they sometimes do events together, things like that.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So actually these fraternities or sororities, it's not independent to a school.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's actually like a wide network of people that belong to this club.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a national network usually.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So it's kind of like being in the Boy Scouts.

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, similar, except the activities are much different.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So these people, they may live at the frat house, like in this dialogue.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's living at the frat house.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now remember here, fraternity, that becomes frat if we're talking colloquially.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
So the frat house is the fraternity house.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's where those boys live, but only the Phi Iota Alpha boys.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So no one, if I have a friend and he's not Phi Iota Alpha, then he can't live there.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Exactly.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And we have a similar thing for girls.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's the sorority house.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, very good.

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So a frat house is the fraternity house, basically like their clubhouse.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where they live though.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Right.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So sometimes guys that belong to fraternities, they're referred to as frat boys.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Frat boy, yeah.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So fraternity boy, this is not always the nicest thing to say.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's got a negative meaning because a lot of the activities that frat boys do stereotypically involve lots of drinking and maybe being loud.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So frat boy is someone who's in a fraternity and it's usually a critical way of talking about those guys.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So this whole fraternity sorority thing, as he said, is a little bit cliche, right?

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, this is a great word.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I use this a lot, actually.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So something that's cliche would be almost what's expected, but in a bad way, right?

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And so...

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So you joining a fraternity is a little bit cliche because it's kind of like...

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's what everyone does in the movies and on TV, like, oh, I'm going to college, I'm going to join a fraternity.

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's almost, like, boring.

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's so normal.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But you could also say that that movie, at the end of the movie, the man and the woman, they fought, but then they got back together.

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's so cliche.

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So it's something that's overused, expected, very typical.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Uninteresting, yeah.

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Uninteresting, okay.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So we have a cliche, we're saying that a fraternity is cliche.

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Now the other guy, on the other hand, is living off campus, he lives at home, but he said he commutes to school every day.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So he says, I'm commuting to school.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is interesting.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now, in America, there's usually two options.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
One is to live on campus.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That means to live at your university in a dormitory or an apartment.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But many people commute, and this means they drive to school every day, and then they drive home at night.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They don't live on the campus.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So you can also commute to work every day, right?

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is what people do.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You don't live at the office.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Exactly.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I hope not.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, this is a common thing.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
People will drive to work, and you might ask them, how long is your commute?

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you say, oh, one hour.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That means I drive one hour to work.

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So if I take the bus or the train, the subway, is that also commuting?

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It is.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It doesn't matter how you do it.

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It just means you don't live where you work or where you study, so you have to travel there by some means of transportation.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So, well, now going back to the academic aspect of this dialogue, he said that he ended up dropping a class.

189
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so to drop means to stop attending a class.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Maybe you don't have enough time.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Maybe you don't like it, but to drop a class means you will no longer study.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You will not take the tests.

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You will not get a grade.

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's the opposite of to sign up for a class or to register for a class.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So the difference between dropping a class and failing a class is that basically you're making the decision to not go there anymore.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Exactly.

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And usually there's a time you can do this.

198
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So for the first two weeks, you can attend classes.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And if you don't have enough time or you don't like a class, you can drop the class.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But if you stay in the class, you just don't come or you do very poorly on your tests, that's called failing.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So there are some classes, because I don't know, can you drop any class or do you have to take them at some point?

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's a good question.

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's our next phrase.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's a prerequisite course, right?

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So usually the university in America will tell you, you have to study math.

206
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You have to study one semester of science.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You have to study English, you know, for one semester.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So these are called prerequisites.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's when the university tells you, you have to study something.

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And it's, I think you also have some courses that you can't take until you've passed some other course, right?

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So like, for example, you can't take economy unless you've passed, I don't know, calculus.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Exactly.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's another prerequisite.

214
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So we'd say the prerequisite for economics is calculus one or the prerequisites.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The prerequisite for Spanish 200 is Spanish 100.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It means you have to take something before you take something else.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So there's two meanings of the word, but they're both related to requirements, what you have to do.

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You need a requirement.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Now, moving on and talking about the major.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He said if, well, if you decided on a major and he said, well, pre-med.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
All right.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So major, first of all, is what you choose to study, right?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The focus of your study.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Exactly.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The focus.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You might study other classes, but your focus, your main interest area is one thing.

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And in his case, he's talking about pre-med.

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Now what does pre-med stand for?

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Because it is a short version of a longer word.

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So it's pre-medicine.

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So medicine is something you study if you want to be a doctor.

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So pre-, because in America, you don't become a doctor after four years.

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You have to go get your BA, your bachelor's degree, and then you have to get your PhD, your doctorate.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So people who want to go to graduate school first have to study many required courses.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's the pre-med focus.

239
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay.

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So that's what he's talking about.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's definitely going to focus on pre-med.

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He wants to be a doctor.

243
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He's not going to be a doctor soon, but he wants to start studying to be a doctor.

244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So he will, he will become a pre-med, a pre-med major.

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And what about for lawyers?

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I know that there are also something that you focus on before.

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There is.

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah, that's called pre-law.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Same idea.

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Pre- means before.

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So obviously a lawyer needs to study for a long time as well.

252
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And with your undergrad degree, so your first four years, you would study pre-law.

253
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So this is what you focus on for your four years, and then you go into grad school and become an attorney or a specific type of lawyer.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But a lawyer doesn't have to study for a PhD.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A lawyer studies for a JD.

256
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's called a Juris Doctorate.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's the law degree.

258
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Uh-huh.

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Interesting.

260
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay.

261
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So, well, he's going into pre-med, but the other guy, he's like, well, I don't have a clue yet, and he doesn't have to declare a major until the sophomore year.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay.

263
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
A couple of things going on here.

264
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
First of all, there are different names for each year.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, one, two, three, four.

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So sophomore year is the second year.

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So if you say I'm a sophomore student at XY University, that means you're in your second year.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Exactly.

269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And he says that he doesn't have to declare a major until his second year, until his sophomore year.

270
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And this phrase, to declare a major, is very important.

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It means that you will tell the university what your focus will be.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Right.

273
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And you have to do this.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can't just go to school and then graduate.

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You have to say, I will focus on this, because every major has what we just talked about, prerequisites.

276
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So, but in this first year, you don't have to tell the university yet what you want to study.

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Maybe you just, you take a variety of courses, and then you tell them, okay, now I'm going to focus on this, right?

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Exactly.

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's what I did, and that's very common for liberal arts schools.

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Maybe if you're in a specific trade school or you're in a certain track, you would have a different situation.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But for me, liberal arts, I studied history, I studied philosophy, I studied language and literature.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And then my sophomore year, my second year, I decided, oh, I will study philosophy.

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So you're going to focus on that?

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes, one thing.

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So it's interesting because in many other countries, the education system requires you to declare your major before you start studying, right?

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You say, well, I'm going to study business, and then your four years are around that.

287
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Whereas in some places in the United States or for some majors, you don't have to do that.

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's true.

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I've also heard in England, for example, you have one area of study, one major, and that's all you study.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Right, because in the US, you can get a major in history with a minor in philosophy, right?

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Exactly.

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I was the opposite.

293
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I had a major in philosophy and a minor in history.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So major means something bigger, more important, and minor is smaller or less important.

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And a minor is your second field of study.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So you take fewer classes, but you still know something about that.

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But do they always have to be related?

298
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Because like, for example, can you be a major of philosophy with a minor in, I don't know, astronomy or something like that?

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Absolutely.

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Something like pre-med, so medicine, it's hard because there's so many requirements.

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But I had a number of friends who are majoring in computer science and a minor in literature, for example.

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So you can mix it up at certain schools.

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So what would be the advantage of doing something like that?

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Because most places or most education systems teach that you should specialize, you should be focused on one area.

305
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So if you're in computer science, then you should be focused on that.

306
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So why would somebody specialize in computer science in their major, but then take a minor in literature or something?

307
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, let's use that example.

308
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I think one of the benefits for the liberal arts degree, and this is something they talk about a lot in education, is that you have a broad area of knowledge.

309
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
So yes, you know a lot about computer science.

310
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You have to, to graduate.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But maybe in your future, you will write articles about computer science, or you want to blog, or you want a job that has a public relations aspect.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You need to know how to write.

313
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And you're not going to learn how to write in all of your computer science classes, but you will by reading a lot and writing a lot in your literature classes.

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So some people like to say that it's very good to mix up business and languages or computer science and literature, because it's a way to be well-rounded.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's right, that's actually interesting, because in most places, specifically in the exact sciences fields, they focus more on that, like engineers.

316
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's all about engineering, math, and all this, but the human aspect, like you said, or the liberal arts aspect, like literature or history, they don't get much of that.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So when you actually have to become a manager or write or manage people, you don't really have the skills to do that, because you never really took a class.

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's right.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And it can be very hard to learn how to write well and to speak well all of a sudden.

320
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
And I think that's where people struggle also when they're applying for jobs.

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So I don't know, I believe in being a well-rounded individual.

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Obviously there's some benefits to being very, very knowledgeable about one thing.

323
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So I guess we could ask you guys, our users, do you believe that it's better to be knowledgeable about one thing or maybe more well-rounded and to be an expert in many different things?

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right, yeah, you should let us know.

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's jump into our dialogue one last time.

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's take a look at what everyone was saying, and we'll be back in a bit.

327
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Hey, Jordan, is that you?

328
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Long time no see.

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Oh, hey, no kidding.

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So how you been?

332
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Settling into college life okay?

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yeah, I think so.

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yeah, yeah, I know.

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision.

338
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What about you?

340
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What have you been up to?

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, not much.

342
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

343
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

345
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah, it is a little bit.

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I joined the great outdoors club though, which has been a lot of fun.

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's cool.

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Definitely pre-med.

353
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What about you?

354
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year.

355
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I've got time.

356
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oops, I'm late for class.

357
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Gotta run.

358
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Okay.

359
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Take care.

360
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, nice running into you.

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, you too.

362
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All right.

363
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So it's a very interesting topic.

364
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Education systems are so different around the world.

365
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The way that you go to college, how many years, I know that in England you can do a master's in a year, I think.

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, one year.

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Whereas in the States it's two or three.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I think even a bachelor's in England is three years.

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I believe so.

370
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah.

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But they also have an extra year of high school.

372
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
An extra year of high school.

373
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Fifth year, yeah.

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Okay.

375
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So every system is a bit different.

376
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And in America generally it's either two or four years for your college degree.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And then, yeah, it's graduate school for two, three or four years.

378
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now one of the interesting things that I found is kind of unique to the Latin American education system is that people can actually go to college for five years for majors like in business.

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And what they do is they call it a commercial engineer.

380
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So it's an engineering major, but it's not really engineering because it's business.

381
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So it's interesting because you go to school for five years to be a business major.

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, we have something called a joint program, J-O-I-N-T, joint, meaning coming together.

383
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And you could do that.

384
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You could be, for example, a chemistry major but also a business major and then maybe go into oil refinery or some kind of very specialized business where you do need to know something about chemistry.

385
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
And that's called a joint degree.

386
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's really smart as well.

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, I think so.

388
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, it's interesting.

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let us know what you studied.

390
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Maybe you went to school for two years.

391
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I think you can get a technical degree in two years?

392
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yeah, associate's degree or a technical degree for two years.

393
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And then you can get a bachelor's, a master's, a PhD.

394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Let us know what your education background is like and how it works in your country.

395
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

396
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We hope to see you there.

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
All right, guys.

398
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Bye.
