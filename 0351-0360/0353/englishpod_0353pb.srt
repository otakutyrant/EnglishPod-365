00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:03,399
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,099
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,339
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about American education and college life.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:10,980
That's right.

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:19,399
This is actually a user suggestion that they wanted to know more or less what it would be like a dialogue between friends on a typical day in college.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,179
All right.

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,679
So this is an advanced level lesson.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,480
We're going to be talking in a normal conversational speed.

9
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:30,519
We're going to listen to the dialogue, and when we come back, we'll talk about some of these key phrases and words that might help you understand the dialogue better.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,060
Hey, Jordan, is that you?

11
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:39,119
Long time no see.

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,600
Oh, hey, no kidding.

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,659
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,439
So how you been?

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,200
Settling into college life okay?

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,659
Yeah, I think so.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,619
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

19
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,859
Yeah, yeah, I know.

20
00:00:56,859 --> 00:01:00,000
It's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision.

21
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:02,979
I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,060
What about you?

23
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,219
What have you been up to?

24
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:06,599
Well, not much.

25
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

26
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,840
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,439
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

28
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,620
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.

29
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:25,579
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.

30
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,659
Yeah, it is a little bit.

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,579
I joined the great outdoors club though, which has been a lot of fun.

32
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:35,640
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

33
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,680
That's cool.

34
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:39,140
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,219
Definitely pre-med.

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,200
What about you?

37
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,700
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,599
So I've got time.

39
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,159
Oops, I'm late for class.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,799
Gotta run.

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,420
Okay.

42
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:50,900
Take care.

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,680
Hey, nice running into you.

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,500
Yeah, you too.

45
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,159
All right, we're back.

46
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:01,200
So now let's start with all these words and phrases on language takeaway.

47
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,980
Language takeaway.

48
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,500
So, hey Jordan, is that you?

49
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,960
Long time no see.

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,979
I love this phrase.

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,620
Right, this phrase long time no see, which if you look at it, it doesn't really make sense.

52
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:18,020
It looks like we're missing a couple of words.

53
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,680
It looks like an incomplete sentence.

54
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,520
Yeah, like the subject.

55
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,120
Who?

56
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:22,919
Right.

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,680
I haven't seen you.

58
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,780
You haven't seen you.

59
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:26,039
Right.

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,900
So really the meaning of this is, I haven't seen you in a long time.

61
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,620
That's right.

62
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,439
And actually I've heard that this phrase was taken from Chinese.

63
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,580
I've also heard that.

64
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,280
So it's kind of like pigeon English.

65
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,099
And now it's very, very common in English to say this.

66
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,080
You say this with your friends.

67
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,979
It's very casual.

68
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,280
And yeah, long time no see.

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,699
Because if you translate this literally to Chinese, it makes sense, right?

70
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,280
Yes, it does.

71
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,900
So it's interesting.

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:53,759
All right.

73
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:53,900
All right.

74
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,740
So we haven't seen our friend in a long time.

75
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
And he's like, yeah, no kidding.

76
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,020
You know what?

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,340
I think it's been since orientation.

78
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,759
So what is this orientation that he's talking about?

79
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,159
Now this is an important part of the average American college experience.

80
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:15,060
Orientation is a special time, maybe for one week or a couple of days, at the very beginning of your first year of university.

81
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:15,879
All right.

82
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,960
So my first week of school, I didn't have any classes, but I went to school and with So all of the other first year students were called freshmen.

83
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,740
I had to do activities and meet people and sign up for classes.

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,860
And basically orientation is a time when you learn about a new system or a new program.

85
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:42,819
So how it works, because, you know, maybe you don't really know yet how to pick your classes or where the dorms are or how the meals work if you have to go to the cafeteria, etc.

86
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:43,180
Right?

87
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:43,939
Exactly.

88
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,719
And it comes from the verb to orient.

89
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,080
So I orient myself by facing the right direction.

90
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,060
So orientation is really about teaching you how to start in a new system.

91
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,240
Okay, very good.

92
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,539
So well, in that was three months ago, and a lot has happened.

93
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,620
Our speaker says that he pledged Phi Iota Alpha.

94
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,800
So what is this to pledge in this now?

95
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,060
This is Greek as well.

96
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,719
Phi Iota Alpha is Greek.

97
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,900
And this means that we're talking about a fraternity.

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,079
So fraternity is a group of boys, a sorority is a group of girls.

99
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,120
And these are communities, so social societies, that you have to apply to be a member of.

100
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
So we don't say apply.

101
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:24,899
Right.

102
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,560
You pledge.

103
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:26,100
You pledge.

104
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,120
So it's like I pledge allegiance.

105
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,100
You say, I want to be in your group.

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
I want to be in your fraternity.

107
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,579
And so you will have to do special things to become a member.

108
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:43,699
So the verb to pledge would be to basically to promise something honorably or faithfully, right?

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,480
Exactly.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,899
And that's the nice way of putting it.

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:57,540
But generally, when you talk about sororities and fraternities, these upperclassmen, so third, fourth year students, they make the students who are pledging do very weird things.

112
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,620
So as you said, this is for these two guys.

113
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,100
This is for a fraternity.

114
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,519
But if it's this type of club for girls, it's called a sorority.

115
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,639
Okay, so it's different.

116
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
So I'm pledging this sorority.

117
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,079
That means I'm trying to become a member of this sorority.

118
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:24,120
So I think it's worthwhile mentioning many of you have probably seen it in movies, these fraternities or sororities, and they all have names based on the Greek alphabet.

119
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:24,699
Right.

120
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:34,360
So the letters Phi Iota Alpha or Kappa Kappa Gamma, these are the letters that basically represent the name of the fraternity.

121
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:39,759
And what's interesting is that maybe I am in Kappa Kappa Gamma at my school.

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,540
There's another school with another Kappa Kappa Gamma.

123
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,459
We're all related.

124
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,939
It's the same social community.

125
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,379
So they sometimes do events together, things like that.

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,620
So actually these fraternities or sororities, it's not independent to a school.

127
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,300
It's actually like a wide network of people that belong to this club.

128
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,319
It's a national network usually.

129
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,759
So it's kind of like being in the Boy Scouts.

130
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,959
Yeah, similar, except the activities are much different.

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,199
That's right.

132
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,000
So these people, they may live at the frat house, like in this dialogue.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,819
He's living at the frat house.

134
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,339
Now remember here, fraternity, that becomes frat if we're talking colloquially.

135
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,860
So the frat house is the fraternity house.

136
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:26,040
It's where those boys live, but only the Phi Iota Alpha boys.

137
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,199
So no one, if I have a friend and he's not Phi Iota Alpha, then he can't live there.

138
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,779
Exactly.

139
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,500
And we have a similar thing for girls.

140
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,939
That's the sorority house.

141
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:37,120
Okay, very good.

142
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,339
So a frat house is the fraternity house, basically like their clubhouse.

143
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,439
Where they live though.

144
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:42,879
Right.

145
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,240
So sometimes guys that belong to fraternities, they're referred to as frat boys.

146
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,100
Frat boy, yeah.

147
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,899
So fraternity boy, this is not always the nicest thing to say.

148
00:06:54,939 --> 00:07:05,019
It's got a negative meaning because a lot of the activities that frat boys do stereotypically involve lots of drinking and maybe being loud.

149
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:12,000
So frat boy is someone who's in a fraternity and it's usually a critical way of talking about those guys.

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,500
So this whole fraternity sorority thing, as he said, is a little bit cliche, right?

151
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:20,220
Yeah, this is a great word.

152
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,720
I use this a lot, actually.

153
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:28,839
So something that's cliche would be almost what's expected, but in a bad way, right?

154
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,980
And so...

155
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,920
So you joining a fraternity is a little bit cliche because it's kind of like...

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,279
It's what everyone does in the movies and on TV, like, oh, I'm going to college, I'm going to join a fraternity.

157
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,519
It's almost, like, boring.

158
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,980
It's so normal.

159
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,120
But you could also say that that movie, at the end of the movie, the man and the woman, they fought, but then they got back together.

160
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,199
It's so cliche.

161
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,680
Right.

162
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,620
So it's something that's overused, expected, very typical.

163
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,519
Uninteresting, yeah.

164
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,379
Uninteresting, okay.

165
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:02,399
So we have a cliche, we're saying that a fraternity is cliche.

166
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,139
Now the other guy, on the other hand, is living off campus, he lives at home, but he said he commutes to school every day.

167
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:11,180
So he says, I'm commuting to school.

168
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,699
This is interesting.

169
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,220
Now, in America, there's usually two options.

170
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,220
One is to live on campus.

171
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,779
That means to live at your university in a dormitory or an apartment.

172
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:27,240
But many people commute, and this means they drive to school every day, and then they drive home at night.

173
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,620
They don't live on the campus.

174
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,759
So you can also commute to work every day, right?

175
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:32,539
This is what people do.

176
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
You don't live at the office.

177
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,139
Exactly.

178
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:34,840
I hope not.

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,500
No, this is a common thing.

180
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,820
People will drive to work, and you might ask them, how long is your commute?

181
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,440
So you say, oh, one hour.

182
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:43,980
That means I drive one hour to work.

183
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,120
So if I take the bus or the train, the subway, is that also commuting?

184
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,720
It is.

185
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,340
It doesn't matter how you do it.

186
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,600
It just means you don't live where you work or where you study, so you have to travel there by some means of transportation.

187
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,220
Okay.

188
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:06,960
So, well, now going back to the academic aspect of this dialogue, he said that he ended up dropping a class.

189
00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:12,700
Okay, so to drop means to stop attending a class.

190
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,679
Maybe you don't have enough time.

191
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,860
Maybe you don't like it, but to drop a class means you will no longer study.

192
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,080
You will not take the tests.

193
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,259
You will not get a grade.

194
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:28,980
It's the opposite of to sign up for a class or to register for a class.

195
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:38,059
So the difference between dropping a class and failing a class is that basically you're making the decision to not go there anymore.

196
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:38,860
Exactly.

197
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,120
And usually there's a time you can do this.

198
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:44,600
So for the first two weeks, you can attend classes.

199
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,820
And if you don't have enough time or you don't like a class, you can drop the class.

200
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:54,139
But if you stay in the class, you just don't come or you do very poorly on your tests, that's called failing.

201
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:02,100
So there are some classes, because I don't know, can you drop any class or do you have to take them at some point?

202
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,899
That's a good question.

203
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,039
That's our next phrase.

204
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,399
That's a prerequisite course, right?

205
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,299
So usually the university in America will tell you, you have to study math.

206
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,679
You have to study one semester of science.

207
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,179
You have to study English, you know, for one semester.

208
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,840
So these are called prerequisites.

209
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,360
It's when the university tells you, you have to study something.

210
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:29,039
And it's, I think you also have some courses that you can't take until you've passed some other course, right?

211
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:35,220
So like, for example, you can't take economy unless you've passed, I don't know, calculus.

212
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:36,259
Exactly.

213
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,340
That's another prerequisite.

214
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:44,360
So we'd say the prerequisite for economics is calculus one or the prerequisites.

215
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,259
The prerequisite for Spanish 200 is Spanish 100.

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,120
It means you have to take something before you take something else.

217
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:57,559
So there's two meanings of the word, but they're both related to requirements, what you have to do.

218
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:57,940
Okay.

219
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,179
You need a requirement.

220
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,139
Now, moving on and talking about the major.

221
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,159
He said if, well, if you decided on a major and he said, well, pre-med.

222
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:08,019
All right.

223
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,120
So major, first of all, is what you choose to study, right?

224
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,740
The focus of your study.

225
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,059
Exactly.

226
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,500
The focus.

227
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,120
You might study other classes, but your focus, your main interest area is one thing.

228
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,600
And in his case, he's talking about pre-med.

229
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,179
Now what does pre-med stand for?

230
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,059
Because it is a short version of a longer word.

231
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,019
So it's pre-medicine.

232
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,559
Yeah.

233
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:27,940
Okay.

234
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:31,200
So medicine is something you study if you want to be a doctor.

235
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,980
So pre-, because in America, you don't become a doctor after four years.

236
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:42,559
You have to go get your BA, your bachelor's degree, and then you have to get your PhD, your doctorate.

237
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:48,580
So people who want to go to graduate school first have to study many required courses.

238
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,700
That's the pre-med focus.

239
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay.

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,159
So that's what he's talking about.

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,559
He's definitely going to focus on pre-med.

242
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,000
He wants to be a doctor.

243
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,860
He's not going to be a doctor soon, but he wants to start studying to be a doctor.

244
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:05,440
So he will, he will become a pre-med, a pre-med major.

245
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,740
And what about for lawyers?

246
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,240
I know that there are also something that you focus on before.

247
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,059
There is.

248
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,179
Yeah, that's called pre-law.

249
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:13,879
Same idea.

250
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,940
Pre- means before.

251
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,960
So obviously a lawyer needs to study for a long time as well.

252
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,580
And with your undergrad degree, so your first four years, you would study pre-law.

253
00:12:23,939 --> 00:12:30,740
So this is what you focus on for your four years, and then you go into grad school and become an attorney or a specific type of lawyer.

254
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,879
But a lawyer doesn't have to study for a PhD.

255
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,460
A lawyer studies for a JD.

256
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:37,899
That's called a Juris Doctorate.

257
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:38,840
That's the law degree.

258
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,379
Uh-huh.

259
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:39,919
Interesting.

260
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Okay.

261
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:50,860
So, well, he's going into pre-med, but the other guy, he's like, well, I don't have a clue yet, and he doesn't have to declare a major until the sophomore year.

262
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,059
Okay.

263
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,039
A couple of things going on here.

264
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,340
First of all, there are different names for each year.

265
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:00,299
So freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, one, two, three, four.

266
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,519
So sophomore year is the second year.

267
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,220
So if you say I'm a sophomore student at XY University, that means you're in your second year.

268
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:07,840
Exactly.

269
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:12,759
And he says that he doesn't have to declare a major until his second year, until his sophomore year.

270
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,100
And this phrase, to declare a major, is very important.

271
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,460
It means that you will tell the university what your focus will be.

272
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,059
Right.

273
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,000
And you have to do this.

274
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,200
You can't just go to school and then graduate.

275
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,840
You have to say, I will focus on this, because every major has what we just talked about, prerequisites.

276
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,039
So, but in this first year, you don't have to tell the university yet what you want to study.

277
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:41,580
Maybe you just, you take a variety of courses, and then you tell them, okay, now I'm going to focus on this, right?

278
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,220
Exactly.

279
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,940
That's what I did, and that's very common for liberal arts schools.

280
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:53,159
Maybe if you're in a specific trade school or you're in a certain track, you would have a different situation.

281
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:58,759
But for me, liberal arts, I studied history, I studied philosophy, I studied language and literature.

282
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,860
And then my sophomore year, my second year, I decided, oh, I will study philosophy.

283
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,080
So you're going to focus on that?

284
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:05,840
Yes, one thing.

285
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:15,879
So it's interesting because in many other countries, the education system requires you to declare your major before you start studying, right?

286
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:20,980
You say, well, I'm going to study business, and then your four years are around that.

287
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,379
Whereas in some places in the United States or for some majors, you don't have to do that.

288
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,080
That's true.

289
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,179
And I've also heard in England, for example, you have one area of study, one major, and that's all you study.

290
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,019
Right, because in the US, you can get a major in history with a minor in philosophy, right?

291
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,679
Exactly.

292
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,500
I was the opposite.

293
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,220
I had a major in philosophy and a minor in history.

294
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,500
So major means something bigger, more important, and minor is smaller or less important.

295
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,960
And a minor is your second field of study.

296
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,940
So you take fewer classes, but you still know something about that.

297
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,639
But do they always have to be related?

298
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,779
Because like, for example, can you be a major of philosophy with a minor in, I don't know, astronomy or something like that?

299
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,279
Absolutely.

300
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,559
Something like pre-med, so medicine, it's hard because there's so many requirements.

301
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:15,000
But I had a number of friends who are majoring in computer science and a minor in literature, for example.

302
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,360
So you can mix it up at certain schools.

303
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,379
So what would be the advantage of doing something like that?

304
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:31,299
Because most places or most education systems teach that you should specialize, you should be focused on one area.

305
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:33,919
So if you're in computer science, then you should be focused on that.

306
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:40,620
So why would somebody specialize in computer science in their major, but then take a minor in literature or something?

307
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,059
Well, let's use that example.

308
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:49,899
I think one of the benefits for the liberal arts degree, and this is something they talk about a lot in education, is that you have a broad area of knowledge.

309
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,100
So yes, you know a lot about computer science.

310
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,340
You have to, to graduate.

311
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,639
But maybe in your future, you will write articles about computer science, or you want to blog, or you want a job that has a public relations aspect.

312
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,919
You need to know how to write.

313
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,720
And you're not going to learn how to write in all of your computer science classes, but you will by reading a lot and writing a lot in your literature classes.

314
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:19,419
So some people like to say that it's very good to mix up business and languages or computer science and literature, because it's a way to be well-rounded.

315
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:31,299
That's right, that's actually interesting, because in most places, specifically in the exact sciences fields, they focus more on that, like engineers.

316
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:40,879
It's all about engineering, math, and all this, but the human aspect, like you said, or the liberal arts aspect, like literature or history, they don't get much of that.

317
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:49,159
So when you actually have to become a manager or write or manage people, you don't really have the skills to do that, because you never really took a class.

318
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:49,679
That's right.

319
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:55,039
And it can be very hard to learn how to write well and to speak well all of a sudden.

320
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:59,480
And I think that's where people struggle also when they're applying for jobs.

321
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,220
So I don't know, I believe in being a well-rounded individual.

322
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:09,079
Obviously there's some benefits to being very, very knowledgeable about one thing.

323
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:19,640
So I guess we could ask you guys, our users, do you believe that it's better to be knowledgeable about one thing or maybe more well-rounded and to be an expert in many different things?

324
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,539
That's right, yeah, you should let us know.

325
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,940
Let's jump into our dialogue one last time.

326
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,839
Let's take a look at what everyone was saying, and we'll be back in a bit.

327
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,339
Hey, Jordan, is that you?

328
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:35,420
Long time no see.

329
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,859
Oh, hey, no kidding.

330
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago.

331
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,680
So how you been?

332
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,460
Settling into college life okay?

333
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,960
Yeah, I think so.

334
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,980
I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I'm living at the frat house now.

335
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,880
Oh, so you're a frat boy now, huh?

336
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,140
Yeah, yeah, I know.

337
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,259
It's totally cliche, but really, I think it's been a good decision.

338
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:59,220
Got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.

339
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,319
What about you?

340
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,539
What have you been up to?

341
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,859
Well, not much.

342
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,940
I'm still living at home and commuting to school.

343
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:10,119
I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about.

344
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,700
It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped.

345
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:18,880
The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.

346
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,859
That sounds smart, but kind of boring.

347
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah, it is a little bit.

348
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,859
I joined the great outdoors club though, which has been a lot of fun.

349
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,920
We've gone on two camping trips already and I've made some good friends.

350
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,940
That's cool.

351
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,400
Hey, so have you decided on your major yet?

352
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:36,500
Definitely pre-med.

353
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,480
What about you?

354
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:42,960
I still have no clue, but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year.

355
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,880
So I've got time.

356
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:45,420
Oops, I'm late for class.

357
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,079
Gotta run.

358
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:46,680
Okay.

359
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,180
Take care.

360
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,960
Hey, nice running into you.

361
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:49,819
Yeah, you too.

362
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,160
All right.

363
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,599
So it's a very interesting topic.

364
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,980
Education systems are so different around the world.

365
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:04,299
The way that you go to college, how many years, I know that in England you can do a master's in a year, I think.

366
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,839
Yeah, one year.

367
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,259
Whereas in the States it's two or three.

368
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,579
I think even a bachelor's in England is three years.

369
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:12,980
I believe so.

370
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,259
Yeah.

371
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,119
But they also have an extra year of high school.

372
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,059
An extra year of high school.

373
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:16,380
Fifth year, yeah.

374
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,799
Okay.

375
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,500
So every system is a bit different.

376
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,160
And in America generally it's either two or four years for your college degree.

377
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,900
And then, yeah, it's graduate school for two, three or four years.

378
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:42,299
Now one of the interesting things that I found is kind of unique to the Latin American education system is that people can actually go to college for five years for majors like in business.

379
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,039
And what they do is they call it a commercial engineer.

380
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:54,420
So it's an engineering major, but it's not really engineering because it's business.

381
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,039
So it's interesting because you go to school for five years to be a business major.

382
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Well, we have something called a joint program, J-O-I-N-T, joint, meaning coming together.

383
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,960
And you could do that.

384
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:18,839
You could be, for example, a chemistry major but also a business major and then maybe go into oil refinery or some kind of very specialized business where you do need to know something about chemistry.

385
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,980
And that's called a joint degree.

386
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,660
That's really smart as well.

387
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,539
Yeah, I think so.

388
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,819
Well, it's interesting.

389
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,420
Let us know what you studied.

390
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,039
Maybe you went to school for two years.

391
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,460
I think you can get a technical degree in two years?

392
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,940
Yeah, associate's degree or a technical degree for two years.

393
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:37,579
And then you can get a bachelor's, a master's, a PhD.

394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,779
Let us know what your education background is like and how it works in your country.

395
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,700
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

396
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:45,579
We hope to see you there.

397
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,079
All right, guys.

398
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,299
Bye.
