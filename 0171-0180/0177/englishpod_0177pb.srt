00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And my name is Catherine, and it's the Christmas season, Marco, so that means we have a very festive lesson today.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right, Christmas is coming up, and, well, a tradition among many people around the world is to buy a Christmas tree.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right, I remember when we used to do this in my family, it was one of my favorite times of the year.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we're going to explore this in today's lesson.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
After we listen to the dialogue, we'll be back to talk about some of these interesting words and phrases.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm home.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Everyone, come here.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I bought a Christmas tree.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Wow, it's huge.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Awesome.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Of course it will.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Help me put it in the living room.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I found the lights.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I got the Christmas ornaments.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Great idea.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All right, we're back.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As we mentioned, the entire dialogue is about a Christmas tree, so why don't you explain what a Christmas tree is, because many people maybe don't even do or buy Christmas trees.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, well, a Christmas tree is usually a green tree that we cut down and we put in the house, so it's not a real tree with roots in the ground, but sometimes it comes from a real tree outside.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The tree is very small on the top and it goes out like a triangle, so it's a special shape.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We generally make it look very pretty with lights and ornaments and decorations.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
On Christmas, on the 25th or the 24th, it depends where you come from, we put lots of presents underneath the Christmas tree.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wow, it sounds amazing.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, yeah, and it looks very nice.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It does look really beautiful and it's just a really special part of Christmas.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And well, as you mentioned, sometimes the tree is just a fake plastic tree, but many times it's a real tree and the type of tree that you use is a pine tree.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Exactly, and so pine tree is a kind of tree that doesn't have leaves, it has needles.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That means that they're long, very thin, green pieces that are all over the tree.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And you can see these trees in most northern places like Scandinavia or in America, maybe Illinois and Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And they're very, as you say, very unique trees, but they also have a very special smell, the smell of pine.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
They do.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's very nice.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's such a nice smell that a lot of the things that we use in America to clean our houses have a pine smell because it makes the house smell nice.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Very good.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So a pine tree.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The dad brought a pine tree or a Christmas tree home and, well, the wife was a little bit worried if it will fit.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, will it fit?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is a very important question because a lot of pine trees are very, very tall.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So if a pine tree is three meters tall or four meters tall, will it fit is the question we ask.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is it too big or is it going to be stuck on the ceiling in the house?

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And so we could ask this about anything.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just bought a new TV.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Will it fit in the living room?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm very nervous.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I spent a lot of money.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And well, you were talking about the Christmas tree and how you put a lot of nice decorations on it.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And so we say that we decorate the tree.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's right.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So the verb here, this is an action word, to decorate.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So every holiday season in my family, we take one day and we decorate the tree.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That means that we take very small special ornaments and ribbons and lights and we put them on the tree to make the tree look pretty.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can also say decorate the house or to decorate the house for a party.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So this means to make something look special or pretty.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Very good.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We've taken a look at very specific words related to, you know, Christmas trees and decorating it.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to continue with some more language takeaway.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm home.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Everyone come here.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I bought a Christmas tree.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wow.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's huge.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Awesome.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Of course it will.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Help me put it in the living room.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I found the lights.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I got the Christmas ornaments.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Great idea.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
All right, we're back.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So why don't we take a look at three more words on language takeaway, part two.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Language takeaway.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There's just so many words that are associated with Christmas and the Christmas season that we have to look at them again here in language takeaway part two.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And the first one we've already mentioned, it goes together with the phrase to decorate the tree.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So what do we decorate the tree with Marco?

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You mentioned ornaments.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Christmas ornaments.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Christmas ornaments.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And so an ornament is a thing.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's something that we use to make something else look prettier.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And so in this case, ornaments are sometimes round and red or green or gold.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We hang them on the tree.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And well, this is in this case, it's a Christmas ornament for the tree.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But an ornament can be anything, any nice piece of art or something that you can use to decorate your house, right?

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Exactly.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And in my family, ornaments aren't just those round circles or balls for Christmas.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Every family member has a special kind of ornament.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So my dad has Santa Claus ornaments and my mom has bunny rabbit ornaments.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And I have angel ornaments.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So everybody has a special one.

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, that's really nice.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And well, apart from ornaments, there is also this tradition of hanging stockings.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so a stocking, you might have heard this word before, in the sense of a clothing item, a stocking is like a sock.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A big sock.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A big sock.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And it also means the old stockings that women would wear, like tights.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But in this case, a stocking, a Christmas stocking, is a very, very, very big sock that we hang.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And on Christmas, we get to fill it with very special things like candy and toys.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Candy, toys, very good.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So actually, you hang the stockings and the common place to do it in or to put them on is on the chimney, right?

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's right.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So there's a fireplace.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And usually above the fireplace, there's a shelf, we call it a mantle.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And there's a place there to hang these.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And the place where all of the smoke from the fire comes out is the chimney.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's also the place where Santa Claus comes down.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So you have the fireplace where you put the wood, you have the mantle, that's the space where you actually put the stockings on, and the tube that goes up and where the smoke comes out of is called the chimney.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Right.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So you don't want to live there.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And actually, the joke is that Santa Claus is definitely too fat to go down the chimney.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But it's a special place in the Christmas story because that's what Santa Claus does.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Very good.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Interesting words.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm home.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Everyone come here.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I bought a Christmas tree.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wow, it's huge.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Awesome.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Of course it will.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Help me put it in the living room.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I found the lights.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I got the Christmas ornaments.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Great idea.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right, we're back.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So as you say, the Christmas season is important in America.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And people not only decorate Christmas trees, but also their house.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And even outside, they put Christmas lights all over the house.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
They put little statues of Santa Claus and reindeer.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And it's a very, I don't know, sometimes lavish thing to do.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It is.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's almost funny how much people like to spend on not just time, but also money on decorating their houses.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And so where I come from, people decorate the outsides a lot.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You have Christmas lights on all parts of the house, and then maybe all of the reindeer in the front yard, all whatever.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There are like 12 of them or 9 of them.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't remember.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But actually it was nice because when I lived there with my parents, we would go out and tour around the neighborhood just to see other people's Christmas lights and decorations because as we say, some of them can be very, very nice.

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And they take a lot of time and effort into decorating it.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They do.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's really special.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And at my house, we generally just decorated the inside, but sometimes we did lights on the outside.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And there's some very funny movies that talk about this, like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And so there's some really funny scenes about putting Christmas lights on the house.

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
All right.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, that's all the time we have for today, but we'll definitely post a link of this movie that's actually very good.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It kind of depicts the traditional American in a funny way.

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's a very funny movie.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
