00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:06,139
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:06,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,119
And my name is Catherine, and it's the Christmas season, Marco, so that means we have a very festive lesson today.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,339
That's right, Christmas is coming up, and, well, a tradition among many people around the world is to buy a Christmas tree.

5
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,620
That's right, I remember when we used to do this in my family, it was one of my favorite times of the year.

6
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,480
So we're going to explore this in today's lesson.

7
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,759
After we listen to the dialogue, we'll be back to talk about some of these interesting words and phrases.

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm home.

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,340
Everyone, come here.

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,820
I bought a Christmas tree.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,979
Wow, it's huge.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,780
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

14
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:54,700
Awesome.

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,439
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

16
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,420
Of course it will.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,380
Help me put it in the living room.

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,939
I found the lights.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,560
I got the Christmas ornaments.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,260
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,620
Great idea.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,519
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

23
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:21,799
All right, we're back.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,400
As we mentioned, the entire dialogue is about a Christmas tree, so why don't you explain what a Christmas tree is, because many people maybe don't even do or buy Christmas trees.

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:43,859
Okay, well, a Christmas tree is usually a green tree that we cut down and we put in the house, so it's not a real tree with roots in the ground, but sometimes it comes from a real tree outside.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,560
The tree is very small on the top and it goes out like a triangle, so it's a special shape.

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,140
We generally make it look very pretty with lights and ornaments and decorations.

28
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:05,280
On Christmas, on the 25th or the 24th, it depends where you come from, we put lots of presents underneath the Christmas tree.

29
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,180
Wow, it sounds amazing.

30
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,259
Well, yeah, and it looks very nice.

31
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,780
It does look really beautiful and it's just a really special part of Christmas.

32
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:22,020
And well, as you mentioned, sometimes the tree is just a fake plastic tree, but many times it's a real tree and the type of tree that you use is a pine tree.

33
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,620
Exactly, and so pine tree is a kind of tree that doesn't have leaves, it has needles.

34
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,780
That means that they're long, very thin, green pieces that are all over the tree.

35
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:44,379
And you can see these trees in most northern places like Scandinavia or in America, maybe Illinois and Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont.

36
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,639
And they're very, as you say, very unique trees, but they also have a very special smell, the smell of pine.

37
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,319
They do.

38
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:51,780
It's very nice.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:59,199
It's such a nice smell that a lot of the things that we use in America to clean our houses have a pine smell because it makes the house smell nice.

40
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,180
Very good.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,740
So a pine tree.

42
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:09,560
The dad brought a pine tree or a Christmas tree home and, well, the wife was a little bit worried if it will fit.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,680
Okay, will it fit?

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,439
This is a very important question because a lot of pine trees are very, very tall.

45
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:22,419
So if a pine tree is three meters tall or four meters tall, will it fit is the question we ask.

46
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,879
Is it too big or is it going to be stuck on the ceiling in the house?

47
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,599
And so we could ask this about anything.

48
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,840
I just bought a new TV.

49
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,620
Will it fit in the living room?

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,620
I don't know.

51
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,659
I'm very nervous.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,000
I spent a lot of money.

53
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:38,919
All right.

54
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:45,060
And well, you were talking about the Christmas tree and how you put a lot of nice decorations on it.

55
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,580
And so we say that we decorate the tree.

56
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,379
That's right.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,400
So the verb here, this is an action word, to decorate.

58
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,400
So every holiday season in my family, we take one day and we decorate the tree.

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,699
That means that we take very small special ornaments and ribbons and lights and we put them on the tree to make the tree look pretty.

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,740
You can also say decorate the house or to decorate the house for a party.

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,659
So this means to make something look special or pretty.

62
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:15,639
Very good.

63
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,079
We've taken a look at very specific words related to, you know, Christmas trees and decorating it.

64
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,459
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to continue with some more language takeaway.

65
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,259
I'm home.

66
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,879
Everyone come here.

67
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:35,339
I bought a Christmas tree.

68
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,620
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

69
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,500
Wow.

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,300
It's huge.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

72
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:42,060
Awesome.

73
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,740
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
Of course it will.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,959
Help me put it in the living room.

76
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,600
I found the lights.

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,199
I got the Christmas ornaments.

78
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,939
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

79
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,259
Great idea.

80
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,100
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

81
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:04,699
All right, we're back.

82
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,860
So why don't we take a look at three more words on language takeaway, part two.

83
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
Language takeaway.

84
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:20,899
There's just so many words that are associated with Christmas and the Christmas season that we have to look at them again here in language takeaway part two.

85
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,540
And the first one we've already mentioned, it goes together with the phrase to decorate the tree.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,720
So what do we decorate the tree with Marco?

87
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,019
You mentioned ornaments.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,519
That's right.

89
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,379
Christmas ornaments.

90
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,480
Christmas ornaments.

91
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,579
And so an ornament is a thing.

92
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:39,579
It's something that we use to make something else look prettier.

93
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,980
And so in this case, ornaments are sometimes round and red or green or gold.

94
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,959
We hang them on the tree.

95
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,759
And well, this is in this case, it's a Christmas ornament for the tree.

96
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:59,019
But an ornament can be anything, any nice piece of art or something that you can use to decorate your house, right?

97
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,800
Exactly.

98
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,139
And in my family, ornaments aren't just those round circles or balls for Christmas.

99
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:09,379
Every family member has a special kind of ornament.

100
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,680
So my dad has Santa Claus ornaments and my mom has bunny rabbit ornaments.

101
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,839
And I have angel ornaments.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,839
So everybody has a special one.

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,839
Oh, that's really nice.

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,240
And well, apart from ornaments, there is also this tradition of hanging stockings.

105
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,459
Okay, so a stocking, you might have heard this word before, in the sense of a clothing item, a stocking is like a sock.

106
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:34,199
A big sock.

107
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,040
A big sock.

108
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,819
And it also means the old stockings that women would wear, like tights.

109
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:46,240
But in this case, a stocking, a Christmas stocking, is a very, very, very big sock that we hang.

110
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,740
And on Christmas, we get to fill it with very special things like candy and toys.

111
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,120
Candy, toys, very good.

112
00:06:52,579 --> 00:07:00,439
So actually, you hang the stockings and the common place to do it in or to put them on is on the chimney, right?

113
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:01,420
That's right.

114
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,480
So there's a fireplace.

115
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,720
And usually above the fireplace, there's a shelf, we call it a mantle.

116
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,220
And there's a place there to hang these.

117
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,560
And the place where all of the smoke from the fire comes out is the chimney.

118
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,279
It's also the place where Santa Claus comes down.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,160
Right.

120
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:29,079
So you have the fireplace where you put the wood, you have the mantle, that's the space where you actually put the stockings on, and the tube that goes up and where the smoke comes out of is called the chimney.

121
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,439
Right.

122
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,720
So you don't want to live there.

123
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:36,040
And actually, the joke is that Santa Claus is definitely too fat to go down the chimney.

124
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,019
But it's a special place in the Christmas story because that's what Santa Claus does.

125
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,600
Very good.

126
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,680
Interesting words.

127
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,360
Why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

128
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm home.

129
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,839
Everyone come here.

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,300
I bought a Christmas tree.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,779
Look at this beautiful pine tree.

132
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,439
Wow, it's huge.

133
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,279
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

134
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,220
Awesome.

135
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,899
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

136
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,920
Of course it will.

137
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,879
Help me put it in the living room.

138
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,399
I found the lights.

139
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,060
I got the Christmas ornaments.

140
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,800
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

141
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,139
Great idea.

142
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,040
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.

143
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,620
All right, we're back.

144
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,240
So as you say, the Christmas season is important in America.

145
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,740
And people not only decorate Christmas trees, but also their house.

146
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,179
And even outside, they put Christmas lights all over the house.

147
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,879
They put little statues of Santa Claus and reindeer.

148
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:50,840
And it's a very, I don't know, sometimes lavish thing to do.

149
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:51,600
It is.

150
00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:00,399
It's almost funny how much people like to spend on not just time, but also money on decorating their houses.

151
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,500
And so where I come from, people decorate the outsides a lot.

152
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:10,480
You have Christmas lights on all parts of the house, and then maybe all of the reindeer in the front yard, all whatever.

153
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,480
There are like 12 of them or 9 of them.

154
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:12,940
I don't remember.

155
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:26,120
But actually it was nice because when I lived there with my parents, we would go out and tour around the neighborhood just to see other people's Christmas lights and decorations because as we say, some of them can be very, very nice.

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,879
And they take a lot of time and effort into decorating it.

157
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,440
They do.

158
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,240
It's really special.

159
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,419
And at my house, we generally just decorated the inside, but sometimes we did lights on the outside.

160
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,419
And there's some very funny movies that talk about this, like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.

161
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,419
And so there's some really funny scenes about putting Christmas lights on the house.

162
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,340
All right.

163
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,340
Well, that's all the time we have for today, but we'll definitely post a link of this movie that's actually very good.

164
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,820
It kind of depicts the traditional American in a funny way.

165
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,059
It's a very funny movie.

166
00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:02,000
