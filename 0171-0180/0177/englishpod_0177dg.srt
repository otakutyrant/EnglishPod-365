00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com I'm home!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Everyone come here!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I bought a Christmas tree!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Look at this beautiful pine tree!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wow!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's huge!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Awesome!

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Of course it will.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Help me put it in the living room.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I found the lights!

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I got the Christmas ornaments.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Great idea!

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.
