00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,459
EnglishPod.com I'm home!

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,480
Everyone come here!

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,939
I bought a Christmas tree!

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,419
Look at this beautiful pine tree!

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,320
Wow!

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,080
It's huge!

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,899
Are you sure it will fit in the living room?

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,839
Awesome!

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,539
I'll go get the Christmas lights.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,559
Of course it will.

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,519
Help me put it in the living room.

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,100
I found the lights!

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,719
I got the Christmas ornaments.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,460
We could also place these stockings next to the chimney.

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,780
Great idea!

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,100
While we decorate the tree, we can listen to some good old Christmas songs.
