EnglishPod.com Bill!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bill!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You gotta help me!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What's wrong?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Slow down or you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Tomorrow's Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm such a bad son.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Take it easy.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little, and see if there's anything she might like.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's just it.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know what to get her.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I suck at getting presents for people.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's where you're making a big mistake.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, you're right.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I know.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now that's a great idea.
