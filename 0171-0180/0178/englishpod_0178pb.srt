1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,140
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,359
And it is the holiday season.

5
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:14,119
That means we're talking about Christmas and Christmas shopping.

6
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,839
We've got a great lesson for you today.

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,940
So we're going to be looking for a Christmas gift.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,480
And so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back to explain some words.

9
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:35,700
Bill, Bill, you've got to help me.

10
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:36,399
What's wrong?

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,960
Slow down, or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

12
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,420
Tomorrow's Christmas, and I haven't bought my mom anything.

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm such a bad son.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,579
Take it easy.

15
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little, and see if there's anything she might like.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
That's just it.

17
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,539
I don't know what to get her.

18
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,539
Last year, I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

19
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,719
I suck at getting presents for people.

20
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,939
That's where you're making a big mistake.

21
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:08,959
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

22
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,459
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

23
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,620
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,079
Yeah, you're right.

25
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,400
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

26
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah, tell me about it.

27
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:25,920
I know.

28
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,239
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

29
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,540
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod?

30
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,840
Now that's a great idea.

31
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,280
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,219
So now, why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway?

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,000
Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,420
Okay, so there are a lot of interesting words in this dialogue.

35
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,519
Some of them have to do with Christmas and some of them have to do with shopping.

36
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,180
So this first one has to do with neither.

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,219
That's actually a phrase.

38
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,680
It's a medical term.

39
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,379
Right.

40
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,459
You talked about a heart attack.

41
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:15,300
Okay, so you know what a heart is, but a heart attack is when there's no more blood going into your heart and your heart stops beating.

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,759
Okay.

43
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:18,300
It's a very, very dangerous situation.

44
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,280
So the person actually said this because the other guy was like, Bill, Bill, you gotta help me.

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,060
He was all very excited.

46
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,419
So he's like, whoa, whoa, you know, slow down or you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

47
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,520
So it's not literal, right?

48
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,020
Yeah, it's not a real heart attack.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,000
He's saying calm down.

50
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:35,599
Calm down.

51
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

52
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:36,919
All right.

53
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:45,259
And well, he was very upset because he hadn't bought a gift and he said, I suck at getting presents for people.

54
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,500
I suck at getting presents for people.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
Well, suck is not a very polite word.

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,719
My mom used to get angry at me when I used it, but it's a way to say that I'm very, very bad at doing something.

57
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,379
So I suck at playing tennis.

58
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:58,879
All right.

59
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,400
Or you can say I suck at math.

60
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,060
All right.

61
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:08,120
But again, this is not something you should use on a test or in an essay because it's very spoken colloquial English.

62
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:08,639
Right.

63
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,460
Exactly.

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,419
And this other word is actually okay to use.

65
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:18,599
And when you're talking about presents or you're talking about decorations, you say something is tacky.

66
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:19,199
Okay.

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,740
Well, if you call something tacky, this is an adjective, so something is tacky.

68
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,979
It's really a matter of opinion.

69
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:26,479
Right.

70
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:26,740
Okay.

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,219
So I think this is tacky, but you don't.

72
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:30,479
Maybe that's a problem.

73
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,539
So let me give you an example of tacky.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,219
I think that clothing with lots of bows and glitter and shiny things are very tacky.

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:41,699
Okay.

76
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,680
So it's something that you don't really like or you think that is a little bit strange.

77
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,560
That's right.

78
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:54,520
So as you say, it's an opinion because you think that clothes with bows and teddy bears on it is tacky.

79
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,979
Well, somebody else can think, no, it's cute.

80
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,599
It's nice.

81
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:03,219
And you can also describe things that people do as being tacky.

82
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,979
So for example, he gave me a present, but he left the price on it.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Oh, that is tacky.

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,939
That's so tacky.

85
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,219
Right.

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,219
That is tacky.

87
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:12,979
All right.

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,919
So the word is tacky.

89
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,160
And moving on, we talked about a gift certificate.

90
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,839
You should get your mom a gift certificate.

91
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,500
Well, a gift certificate is a very popular form of gift giving now.

92
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,839
You know what a gift is, but a certificate is a piece of paper.

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,459
Okay.

94
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,699
So you could have a birth certificate, for example, it says when you were born, where you were born.

95
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,740
But in this case, a gift certificate is a piece of paper that you give someone to say, you have this much money to spend at this store.

96
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:53,399
So I could give my mom a gift certificate for a bookstore for $50 and she can go with this piece of paper and spend $50 for free.

97
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,060
Okay.

98
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,000
Because I already paid.

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,519
Yeah.

100
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:04,860
So it's kind of a very popular thing to do because sometimes, as in the dialogue, you don't know the person's size or you don't know if they like this color.

101
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,720
So you're just like, look, here's a gift certificate for $100.

102
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,620
Go to the store that I know you really like and get yourself whatever you want.

103
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,199
Something nice.

104
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:13,639
Exactly.

105
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,899
But it's less tacky than giving that person cash, right?

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,660
Right.

107
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:17,740
Okay.

108
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,180
Cash is considered a tacky gift.

109
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,240
I'm not really sure why.

110
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,019
It just is.

111
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,639
It's a social custom, but very popular right now are these gift certificates or even gift cards.

112
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,720
They look like credit cards.

113
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,360
Very good.

114
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:31,120
All right.

115
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,879
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll return shortly to take a look at Fluency Builder.

116
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,399
Bill, Bill, you got to help me.

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,100
What's wrong?

118
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,660
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

119
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,120
Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

120
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,920
I'm such a bad son.

121
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,300
Take it easy.

122
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,680
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

123
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,339
That's just it.

124
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,220
I don't know what to get her.

125
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:06,259
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

126
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,420
I suck at getting presents for people.

127
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,660
That's where you're making a big mistake.

128
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,660
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

129
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,180
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

130
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,339
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,779
Yeah, you're right.

132
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,019
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

133
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,379
Yeah, tell me about it.

134
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,660
I know.

135
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,939
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

136
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,279
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called Spanish Pod?

137
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,660
Now, that's a great idea.

138
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,160
All right, we're back.

139
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,779
Now, why don't we take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,519
Okay, I like this first phrase.

141
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,579
Sometimes I have to use it about other people.

142
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,000
Sometimes people use it on me.

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,560
You say, take it easy.

144
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,480
Take it easy.

145
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,519
Hey, take it easy.

146
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:04,879
Relax.

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,899
Yeah, this is a way to say, hey, be calm.

148
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,639
Be calm.

149
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,019
You can't really translate it, right?

150
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,579
Take what easy?

151
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,519
You can't, but there are two main contexts, okay?

152
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,579
There are two situations where this is really popular.

153
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,220
One is this.

154
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,100
Oh my God, Marco.

155
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,220
Oh my God, I'm freaking out.

156
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,100
I really need your help on this, and I really need you to just really just be involved.

157
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,819
Take it easy.

158
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,720
All right, relax.

159
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:29,800
Take it easy.

160
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,379
Okay.

161
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,259
All right, so that's someone who's upset, and you're telling them to calm down.

162
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,560
The second situation is when you're saying goodbye to someone.

163
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:45,240
This is a very kind of, again, spoken language, very comfortable way of saying, hey, see you later.

164
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,579
Right, so it's like, all right, bye.

165
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,180
Take it easy.

166
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,079
Yeah, take it easy.

167
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,819
Have a good one.

168
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,420
Have a good one is another good phrase.

169
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:51,980
Take it easy.

170
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,500
That means take life easy.

171
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,500
Don't rush.

172
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,180
Don't rush.

173
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,600
Yeah.

174
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,939
Enjoy your life.

175
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,220
So if you try this with your English speaking friends, you're saying goodbye, you say, hey, take it easy.

176
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,879
Yeah, bye.

177
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,579
Take it easy.

178
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,500
It's a nice one.

179
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,180
Very nice.

180
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:21,660
All right, and our second phrase is actually, it's interesting because when he talked about the ring that he got for her mom that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

181
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,680
So the construction there, two sizes too big, five sizes too small.

182
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,879
This is a very important construction, and it doesn't quite make sense when you hear it, so that's what we're going to explain right now.

183
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,759
Let me try to explain this using an example.

184
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:46,460
If I have a size seven shoe and my brother gives me a Christmas present of size nine shoes, I say, Peter, these shoes are two sizes too big.

185
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,820
That's the number two.

186
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,480
Two sizes.

187
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,120
T O O too big.

188
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,700
That means they're too big for me by two sizes because the difference between seven and nine is two.

189
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,720
But if he gives me a size five shoe, say, Peter, these shoes are two sizes too small.

190
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,700
That means that, you know, five is two less than seven.

191
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,940
So this is a very popular construction.

192
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:14,759
So you're saying specifically how much bigger or how much smaller the shoes are in the case with the ring or shoes or anything that has a size.

193
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:15,539
Exactly.

194
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,299
But the funny thing is you can also exaggerate.

195
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,080
You could say, oh, this sweater is so ugly.

196
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,100
It's ten sizes too big for me.

197
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,460
It's not really ten sizes.

198
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:24,940
It's not really ten sizes.

199
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,639
All right.

200
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,820
So he uses construction, right?

201
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,220
Using one size too big, et cetera.

202
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,019
Even when you're buying something to the store, to the lady in the store, you can say, oh, I think the shoe is two sizes too big.

203
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,679
Can you give me a smaller pair?

204
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,299
Exactly.

205
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,879
All right.

206
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,659
And our third phrase for today, when the person said, yeah, you're right.

207
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,659
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

208
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:51,440
So we looked at tacky, but what does he mean when it comes down to it?

209
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,480
Okay.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:04,940
Well, this it is very confusing sometimes when we talk about phrases in English, but when it comes down to it as a way to say in reality or actually or the truth is yes.

211
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,000
So it's a way to say something is truthful.

212
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:08,539
Okay.

213
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,860
So I can say when it comes down to it, Catherine is a good friend.

214
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh, all right.

215
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,179
So when times are tough or in the end or actually maybe you have your small faults, but you are a good friend.

216
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:21,440
Right.

217
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,720
Or when it comes down to it, Marco is a really hard worker.

218
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,080
So sometimes he likes to play video games, but when it's a really important, he will work really hard.

219
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,740
Very good.

220
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,759
So very good uses of this phrase and you can use it in many different contexts.

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,500
And for our fourth phrase, when the person said, yeah, tell me about it.

222
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,299
What does it mean?

223
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:42,080
Tell me about it.

224
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,759
Tell me about what?

225
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:43,960
Okay.

226
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,320
Well, this is a really very popular phrase.

227
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,960
You hear this all the time and it's a way to say, yeah, I agree.

228
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,779
I understand.

229
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,600
I understand.

230
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,700
So this is a phrase that means agreement.

231
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,519
Okay.

232
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:04,100
So I can say, God, I really hate winter because when I leave work, it's always really dark.

233
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:04,659
Yeah.

234
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,639
Tell me about it.

235
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,840
It's always dark and it makes me feel lazy.

236
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,519
Right.

237
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,820
And so Marco is agreeing.

238
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,519
He says, I don't like it either.

239
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:12,200
Yeah.

240
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,720
So this is a very, very spoken way, spoken language way of agreeing with someone.

241
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,220
So you say, yeah, tell me about it.

242
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:20,659
Right.

243
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,120
So it's very natural.

244
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:24,559
It's a very natural way of agreeing with someone, right?

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,080
Exactly.

246
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,899
All right.

247
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:27,240
So great phrases.

248
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,240
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

249
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,379
Bill, Bill, you got to help me.

250
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,080
What's wrong?

251
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,620
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

252
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,120
Tomorrow's Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

253
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,879
I'm such a bad son.

254
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,279
Take it easy.

255
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:58,700
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

256
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
That's just it.

257
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,220
I don't know what to get her.

258
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:08,240
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

259
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,419
I suck at getting presents for people.

260
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,620
That's where you're making a big mistake.

261
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,639
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

262
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,139
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

263
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,320
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

264
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,759
Yeah, you're right.

265
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,059
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

266
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:33,379
Yeah, tell me about it.

267
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:36,899
I know your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

268
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:42,259
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called Spanish Pod?

269
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,559
Now that's a great idea.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,299
All right, great.

271
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,820
So now that the Christmas ...

272
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:03,519
All right, so as we said, gift certificates are a good idea, but what else do you like to give as Christmas presents?

273
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:09,779
Personally, I like things that people really think about and spend their time doing or making.

274
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,679
So I like, for example, my mom is a beautiful quilter.

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,379
She makes these big blankets and quilts them.

276
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,179
Sometimes she even quilts names of people and stuff.

277
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,220
Those are really wonderful gifts because the person thinks about you and who you are and what you want.

278
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,379
I like to be able to give gifts like that, but I'm not necessarily that creative.

279
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:41,600
So I think it's nice to give gifts like tickets to a music show or things like that where you know the person will go and have a good time and enjoy themselves.

280
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:47,759
Yeah, I think that's really important because sometimes people just give gifts because you have to.

281
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:48,379
Stuff.

282
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah, like stuff.

283
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:51,539
And you're like, oh, great, a tie.

284
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,139
Kind of impersonal.

285
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:03,059
At the same time, if your dad or your boyfriend or somebody loves ties and has 50 of them and you get them another one that's really interesting or unique, then great, you know.

286
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,159
But it is good to take the time to get somebody something they really like or they would really use or enjoy.

287
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Exactly.

288
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,639
So what kind of gifts do you plan to give this holiday season?

289
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,659
Do you celebrate Christmas?

290
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,899
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

291
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:17,360
Right.

292
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,240
We'll see you guys there.

293
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,220
And until next time.

294
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,580
Bye.

295
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,000
Bye.
