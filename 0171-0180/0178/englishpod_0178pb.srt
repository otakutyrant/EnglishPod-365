1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And it is the holiday season.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That means we're talking about Christmas and Christmas shopping.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We've got a great lesson for you today.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we're going to be looking for a Christmas gift.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back to explain some words.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Bill, Bill, you've got to help me.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What's wrong?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Slow down, or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tomorrow's Christmas, and I haven't bought my mom anything.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm such a bad son.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Take it easy.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little, and see if there's anything she might like.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's just it.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know what to get her.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Last year, I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I suck at getting presents for people.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's where you're making a big mistake.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, you're right.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I know.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called SpanishPod?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now that's a great idea.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So now, why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, so there are a lot of interesting words in this dialogue.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Some of them have to do with Christmas and some of them have to do with shopping.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So this first one has to do with neither.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's actually a phrase.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a medical term.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Right.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You talked about a heart attack.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, so you know what a heart is, but a heart attack is when there's no more blood going into your heart and your heart stops beating.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a very, very dangerous situation.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the person actually said this because the other guy was like, Bill, Bill, you gotta help me.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He was all very excited.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So he's like, whoa, whoa, you know, slow down or you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So it's not literal, right?

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, it's not a real heart attack.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's saying calm down.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Calm down.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All right.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And well, he was very upset because he hadn't bought a gift and he said, I suck at getting presents for people.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I suck at getting presents for people.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, suck is not a very polite word.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My mom used to get angry at me when I used it, but it's a way to say that I'm very, very bad at doing something.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So I suck at playing tennis.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All right.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or you can say I suck at math.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All right.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But again, this is not something you should use on a test or in an essay because it's very spoken colloquial English.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Exactly.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And this other word is actually okay to use.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And when you're talking about presents or you're talking about decorations, you say something is tacky.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, if you call something tacky, this is an adjective, so something is tacky.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's really a matter of opinion.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Right.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So I think this is tacky, but you don't.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Maybe that's a problem.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So let me give you an example of tacky.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think that clothing with lots of bows and glitter and shiny things are very tacky.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So it's something that you don't really like or you think that is a little bit strange.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So as you say, it's an opinion because you think that clothes with bows and teddy bears on it is tacky.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, somebody else can think, no, it's cute.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's nice.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And you can also describe things that people do as being tacky.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So for example, he gave me a present, but he left the price on it.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, that is tacky.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's so tacky.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That is tacky.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So the word is tacky.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And moving on, we talked about a gift certificate.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You should get your mom a gift certificate.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well, a gift certificate is a very popular form of gift giving now.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You know what a gift is, but a certificate is a piece of paper.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So you could have a birth certificate, for example, it says when you were born, where you were born.

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But in this case, a gift certificate is a piece of paper that you give someone to say, you have this much money to spend at this store.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So I could give my mom a gift certificate for a bookstore for $50 and she can go with this piece of paper and spend $50 for free.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because I already paid.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So it's kind of a very popular thing to do because sometimes, as in the dialogue, you don't know the person's size or you don't know if they like this color.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So you're just like, look, here's a gift certificate for $100.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Go to the store that I know you really like and get yourself whatever you want.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Something nice.

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Exactly.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But it's less tacky than giving that person cash, right?

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Right.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Cash is considered a tacky gift.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not really sure why.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It just is.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a social custom, but very popular right now are these gift certificates or even gift cards.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They look like credit cards.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Very good.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All right.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll return shortly to take a look at Fluency Builder.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Bill, Bill, you got to help me.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's wrong?

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm such a bad son.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Take it easy.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's just it.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't know what to get her.

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I suck at getting presents for people.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's where you're making a big mistake.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, you're right.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I know.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called Spanish Pod?

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now, that's a great idea.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right, we're back.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now, why don't we take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, I like this first phrase.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sometimes I have to use it about other people.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sometimes people use it on me.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You say, take it easy.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Take it easy.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, take it easy.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Relax.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, this is a way to say, hey, be calm.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Be calm.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can't really translate it, right?

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Take what easy?

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can't, but there are two main contexts, okay?

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There are two situations where this is really popular.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
One is this.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh my God, Marco.

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh my God, I'm freaking out.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I really need your help on this, and I really need you to just really just be involved.

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Take it easy.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, relax.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Take it easy.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
All right, so that's someone who's upset, and you're telling them to calm down.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The second situation is when you're saying goodbye to someone.

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is a very kind of, again, spoken language, very comfortable way of saying, hey, see you later.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right, so it's like, all right, bye.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Take it easy.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, take it easy.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Have a good one.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Have a good one is another good phrase.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Take it easy.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That means take life easy.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't rush.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't rush.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Enjoy your life.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So if you try this with your English speaking friends, you're saying goodbye, you say, hey, take it easy.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, bye.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Take it easy.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a nice one.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Very nice.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right, and our second phrase is actually, it's interesting because when he talked about the ring that he got for her mom that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So the construction there, two sizes too big, five sizes too small.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is a very important construction, and it doesn't quite make sense when you hear it, so that's what we're going to explain right now.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let me try to explain this using an example.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If I have a size seven shoe and my brother gives me a Christmas present of size nine shoes, I say, Peter, these shoes are two sizes too big.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's the number two.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Two sizes.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
T O O too big.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That means they're too big for me by two sizes because the difference between seven and nine is two.

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But if he gives me a size five shoe, say, Peter, these shoes are two sizes too small.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That means that, you know, five is two less than seven.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So this is a very popular construction.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So you're saying specifically how much bigger or how much smaller the shoes are in the case with the ring or shoes or anything that has a size.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Exactly.

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But the funny thing is you can also exaggerate.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You could say, oh, this sweater is so ugly.

196
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's ten sizes too big for me.

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not really ten sizes.

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not really ten sizes.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So he uses construction, right?

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Using one size too big, et cetera.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Even when you're buying something to the store, to the lady in the store, you can say, oh, I think the shoe is two sizes too big.

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Can you give me a smaller pair?

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Exactly.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And our third phrase for today, when the person said, yeah, you're right.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So we looked at tacky, but what does he mean when it comes down to it?

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, this it is very confusing sometimes when we talk about phrases in English, but when it comes down to it as a way to say in reality or actually or the truth is yes.

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So it's a way to say something is truthful.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So I can say when it comes down to it, Catherine is a good friend.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, all right.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So when times are tough or in the end or actually maybe you have your small faults, but you are a good friend.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Right.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or when it comes down to it, Marco is a really hard worker.

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So sometimes he likes to play video games, but when it's a really important, he will work really hard.

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Very good.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So very good uses of this phrase and you can use it in many different contexts.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And for our fourth phrase, when the person said, yeah, tell me about it.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What does it mean?

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Tell me about it.

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Tell me about what?

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, this is a really very popular phrase.

227
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You hear this all the time and it's a way to say, yeah, I agree.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I understand.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I understand.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So this is a phrase that means agreement.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I can say, God, I really hate winter because when I leave work, it's always really dark.

233
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Tell me about it.

235
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's always dark and it makes me feel lazy.

236
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Right.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And so Marco is agreeing.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He says, I don't like it either.

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So this is a very, very spoken way, spoken language way of agreeing with someone.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So you say, yeah, tell me about it.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right.

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So it's very natural.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's a very natural way of agreeing with someone, right?

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Exactly.

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
All right.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So great phrases.

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Bill, Bill, you got to help me.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What's wrong?

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Slow down or you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tomorrow's Christmas and I haven't bought my mom anything.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm such a bad son.

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Take it easy.

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's go to the mall, window shop a little and see if there's anything she might like.

256
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's just it.

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know what to get her.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I suck at getting presents for people.

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's where you're making a big mistake.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can't just guess people's likes or sizes, especially with clothes or jewelry.

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
At the same time, you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like.

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, you're right.

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, tell me about it.

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I know your mom is trying to learn Spanish, right?

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why don't you get her a gift certificate for this great website I saw called Spanish Pod?

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now that's a great idea.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All right, great.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So now that the Christmas ...

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All right, so as we said, gift certificates are a good idea, but what else do you like to give as Christmas presents?

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Personally, I like things that people really think about and spend their time doing or making.

274
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So I like, for example, my mom is a beautiful quilter.

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
She makes these big blankets and quilts them.

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Sometimes she even quilts names of people and stuff.

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Those are really wonderful gifts because the person thinks about you and who you are and what you want.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I like to be able to give gifts like that, but I'm not necessarily that creative.

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So I think it's nice to give gifts like tickets to a music show or things like that where you know the person will go and have a good time and enjoy themselves.

280
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, I think that's really important because sometimes people just give gifts because you have to.

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Stuff.

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, like stuff.

283
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And you're like, oh, great, a tie.

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Kind of impersonal.

285
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
At the same time, if your dad or your boyfriend or somebody loves ties and has 50 of them and you get them another one that's really interesting or unique, then great, you know.

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But it is good to take the time to get somebody something they really like or they would really use or enjoy.

287
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Exactly.

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So what kind of gifts do you plan to give this holiday season?

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you celebrate Christmas?

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

291
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Right.

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We'll see you guys there.

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And until next time.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Bye.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Bye.
