EnglishPod.com Welcome Mr.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and Mrs.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Carnwell.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Please take a seat.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, that's correct.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, hours and not to mention our mortgage and car payments.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
With the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, you have come to the right place.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes, that makes sense.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you're spending money on the most.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Great!

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We will do that then.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's another thing.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards.
