EnglishPod.com Welcome Mr.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:07,700
and Mrs.

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,140
Carnwell.

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,039
Please take a seat.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:09,900
Thank you.

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,179
So I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,440
Yes, that's correct.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,820
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems.

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,440
But I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,880
We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, hours and not to mention our mortgage and car payments.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:40,359
With the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.

12
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,280
I see.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,460
Well, you have come to the right place.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,020
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,859
Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,380
Yes, that makes sense.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,060
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.

18
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:07,540
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you're spending money on the most.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,819
Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,280
But we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.

21
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,200
Great!

22
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,599
We will do that then.

23
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,480
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,140
That's another thing.

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,640
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards.
