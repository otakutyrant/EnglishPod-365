00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we have an upper intermediate level lesson all about money.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We are going to be talking about money, but most importantly, we need to start saving money.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We need to spend less.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So in order to control spending today, we're talking about budgeting.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So let's take a look at this very important word in today's vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Alright, so as you mentioned, budgeting is...

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
what is to budget?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To budget, that's the verb.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So budgeting is deciding how to spend your money, okay?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So that means that we prepare a plan for how to spend money.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, so that can be a noun and a verb.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
A budget is the plan on how you're going to spend money, and to budget is to execute this plan.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Exactly.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So today we're budgeting a family's spending.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We're trying to control how much this family will spend in the future.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Alright, very good.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Welcome Mr.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and Mrs.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Carnwell.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Please take a seat.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed and you want to start budgeting.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, that's correct.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, hours, and not to mention our mortgage and car payments, with the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered and now we need some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I see.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, you have come to the right place.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, that makes sense.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you're spending money on the most.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Usually, your fixed costs are higher and we can't do much about that.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But we can usually trim your variable costs such as entertainment or clothing.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Great!

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We will do that then.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's another thing.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright, we're back.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So there were some interesting words and phrases in this dialogue related to budgeting in a lot of financial terms here.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So let's get started now on language takeaway.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Language takeaway.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This first term is very important because it tells us what kind of a budget we're talking about.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We're not talking about a company here, we're talking about a family.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And so in this case we use the phrase household, okay?

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So what are we talking about?

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Household income.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Alright, so income we know is the amount of money that comes into maybe your wallet, right?

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My income, my personal income.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's how much money you earn.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, so a household income is how much money the house earns, so all the people that are living in this house, right?

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right, so it could be a family, it could be two married people who are married to each other, so the idea is that it's not one person's income, it's the household income.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Think of a house.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Alright, so it's the combined income of everyone that's living there, or that's making money that lives in this house.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right, so if Marco and I have a household, I earn $10,000 and he earns $10,000, our household income is $20,000.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Very good.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Alright, so then now we know that what our household income is, and in this case we have children, and we give our kids an allowance.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so I had an allowance when I was a kid, this is the amount of money I got from my parents every week, so I get I think $10 a week, and I could spend it on anything I wanted, and I didn't have to work because my parents gave the money to me, and so an allowance is this money, it's the money that mom and dad give to their children, maybe every month or maybe every week.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Now it's not only related to children, right, because maybe if you have a brother, or maybe you're married and your wife is a housewife, maybe you give her an allowance, right?

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Or the opposite, maybe you're a house husband and you get an allowance from your wife.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right, you can have an allowance if you're anyone, you can also have an allowance from your company if you go traveling, so if you have a business trip, your company gives you a food allowance, that's the amount of money you can spend on food, and you don't have to work for it, that's the best part.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Awesome, alright, so after these allowances, they were talking about, well, how the economic downturn has affected their income and their spending.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, so down, you think this is a negative thing, you're right, downturn means when something, when a situation gets worse, okay, or slows down, and in this case the economy is what got worse, and you remember this from last year, things started to get very difficult for people who were in business, and this has affected families, and so we call the situation an economic downturn.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Now the opposite would maybe be an economic boom.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's right, a boom is when things are going well, that means people are earning more money, there are more jobs.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright, very good, and now moving on, as they were talking about budgeting, they mentioned this very important word, very technical, is to allocate money into different areas.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's right, or allocate spending, this is a verb, to allocate, that means to decide where the money will go, okay, so as the mother in a family, I will allocate 10% of the money to the children's allowances, that's a lot, 50% to the mortgage, 20% to the car, car repairs.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So you're allocating your spending.

78
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right, I'm deciding where to spend the money.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, and well, talking about spending, we have this word expenditures.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Expenditures, and so this is a really important word if you're in business as well, because we consider expenditures when we're talking about how much a company earns.

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Expenditures are things that we spend money on, so remember that word expenditures, spend.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, so an expenditure, and this is a noun, and usually it's in the plural, expenditures.

83
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Exactly, expenditures, so we have many expenditures at my house, among them we have the car, the rent, healthcare, things like that.

84
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, perfect, so really good phrases there, really good vocabulary items, why don't we move on now to Fluency Builder.

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Fluency Builder.

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We've got some very fun phrases today, Marco, in Fluency Builder.

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This first one is a very common phrase that we hear in songs and movies.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
To skyrocket.

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Alright, what is skyrocket?

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, you think about a rocket, you know, that's a ship that goes to space.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
To skyrocket means to go up really high, really fast.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The price of gas has skyrocketed, so I remember when I was a kid, gas used to be 98 cents a gallon.

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wow, really?

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And in the 2000s, the price skyrocketed, and it ended up being like $4 a gallon.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, it was really expensive.

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Alright, so this is also, you can talk about sales have skyrocketed, or the price of petroleum has skyrocketed.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So it could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're talking about.

98
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Alright, and now moving on, they said that their spending was out of control.

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, so this family doesn't seem to understand how to budget, they spend on everything, and so the accountant says that your spending is out of control.

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That means that you're spending too much, there's no order to the way that you're spending.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And we actually have a lesson, a previous lesson called out of control spending, that we also touched this topic of what we talk about out of control, something is out of control, a person can be out of control.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Like a child, this child is out of control, he never stops screaming and hitting people.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Alright.

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And our last phrase for today, the accountant says, well, you've come to the right place.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, this is him, this is the accountant bragging.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He's saying, well, I can fix your problems, I can help you, you've come to the right place.

107
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can use this in many different ways, for example, I have a problem maybe with my TV, and I say, Marco, oh my gosh, my TV doesn't work, I don't know what to do, can you help?

108
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Right, and I can say, well, you've come to the right place, I can fix your TV.

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Marco's an expert in electronics.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Alright, so, you've come to the right place, it's a very common phrase, especially as you say when somebody's trying to brag and say, well, I know how to fix your problems, or I know what you need.

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm good at this, you've come to the right place, if you want to learn English, you've come to the right place, EnglishPod.com.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Alright, so let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Welcome, Mr.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
and Mrs.

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Carnwell, please take a seat.

116
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Thank you.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I understand that your family spending has skyrocketed, and you want to start budgeting.

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes, that's correct.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Frankly speaking, our household income is relatively high, and we have never had any money problems.

120
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We have two kids, and with allowances, paying their credit cards, ours, and not to mention our mortgage and car payments.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
With the recent economic downturn, my husband's business has suffered, and now we need some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I see.

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, you have come to the right place.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
First, what we need to do is determine your cash flow.

126
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories, such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes, that makes sense.

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months.

129
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That way we can determine what your average expenditures are, and see which category you're spending money on the most.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Usually, your fixed costs are higher, and we can't do much about that.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But we can usually trim your variable costs, such as entertainment or clothing.

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Great!

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We will do that then.

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Now how about we treat you to a nice dinner?

135
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That's another thing.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you really want to stop spending so much money, throw away at least half of your credit cards.

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
All right, we're back.

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So now talking about allowances.

139
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You said you had an allowance when you were a kid.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Did you really have a $10 a week allowance?

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, I think it was like $8.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It started out at $6 or $5 a week, and then I think the most I got was like $10 or $11.

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh, wow.

144
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So it was like almost about $1 a day.

145
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
About that.

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But usually, the point was that, well, I started working when I was 15, because my parents thought it was important for children to learn how money works.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But I was given that money because at the time, it was enough money to go out one night.

148
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So on Friday nights, if I wanted to go out with my friends, I could go out to watch a movie and get a slice of pizza, and $10 was enough.

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now $10 doesn't even buy you a ticket to the movie, but at the time, it was more than enough.

150
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So this is important, I guess, because different families have different ways of upbringing their children, and in many cases, this doesn't happen, right?

151
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If I want to go out to the movies on a Saturday, then my parents will give me $30, and if I want to go out next weekend, they'll also give me money.

152
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So it's interesting to see the contrast, because obviously, when I was a kid, also, I didn't really get this opportunity of going out all the time, and actually, I had to work for it.

153
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So if I wanted to go out on the weekend, I would get an allowance, but also I would have to wash the car.

154
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That was typical with my dad.

155
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I had to wash the car.

156
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, I think it's interesting, because it shows that the parents want to teach their children about budgeting, because if you only have $10, you really have to budget.

157
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You have to decide how you will allocate that money, even though it's not very much.

158
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So in some ways, it's good practice.

159
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah, it is.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think it's done us well.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We're not in debt.

162
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Not yet.

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
All right.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So let us know how allowances work in your country, or maybe did you have an allowance when you were a kid?

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
A lot of people didn't have an allowance.

166
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I know a lot of friends didn't get allowances.

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and if you have any other questions or doubts, please leave them there as well.

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We hope to hear from you.

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Until next time.

170
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Bye, everyone.
