00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,919
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,459
And my name is Katherine.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,800
So, Marco, what are we talking about here today?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,740
Today we're going shopping again.

6
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:19,920
Mmm, we go shopping a lot here at EnglishPod, but this is an upper intermediate level lesson, so we've got some very specific terminology to cover.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,480
Exactly.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:30,899
We're going shopping for a digital camera, so we're going to be talking about very specific, maybe a little bit technical vocab related to this very fascinating and expensive product.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,100
Alright, I'm very excited.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,920
I recently purchased a camera, but we won't talk about that yet.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,600
Let's take a listen to the dialogue for the first time, and when we come back we can talk about some of the really interesting details.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,439
Hello, ma'am.

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,820
Can I help you find something?

14
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,079
Yes, actually.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,539
I'm looking to buy a camera.

16
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:58,619
We've got a wide selection.

17
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,219
Do you know if you'd like a point-and-shoot or something a little fancier?

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,140
Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else?

19
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:07,519
Actually I'm buying a camera for my husband.

20
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,859
Ah, well then I'd recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR.

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,540
Yeah?

22
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,920
Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:15,879
Sure thing.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,519
Follow me.

25
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,579
This here is the...

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,200
The Canon EOS.

27
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,500
Yeah, it's okay, but I'm looking for something that performs better in low light, has a better display panel, and longer battery life.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,799
Oh, the Nikon D60 is a nice option?

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,620
Yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with?

30
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,019
I don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

31
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,920
Ah, well, this one has the...

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
Looks to me like an 18-55mm lens.

33
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:41,599
Pretty standard.

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,319
That'll do.

35
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,439
Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything.

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,500
So, can I interest you in any accessories?

37
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:50,760
Accessories?

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,739
Do you carry polarizing filters?

39
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,879
Polarizing filters?

40
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,700
Um, we should.

41
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:58,640
I'm sorry, ma'am.

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,060
Looks like we're sold out.

43
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:00,959
No, you're not.

44
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,319
There's some right here.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,340
Oh, well, would you look at that.

46
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,199
Polarizing filters.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,199
Thanks for your help, Ralph.

48
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,020
No problem, ma'am.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Alright, we're back.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,219
So, apparently this girl knew more than the salesman about these things.

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,080
Is this from a real life experience?

52
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,099
Maybe.

53
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:30,620
Maybe.

54
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:45,039
Well, we can get to that later, like I said, but there are some very important words that anyone who wants to buy a camera should know before they go into the store, and these are Language Takeaway.

55
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,060
Language Takeaway.

56
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,560
Alright, so in Language Takeaway today, we have our first difference.

57
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:04,039
Now, it's very important to know the difference between point-and-shoot camera and the digital SLR.

58
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,099
Okay, so digital, everyone knows digital now, right?

59
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,879
That's the kind of photography we have.

60
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,439
You don't use film, okay?

61
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,439
It uses a memory card to record digital images.

62
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,259
But point-and-shoot are those little cameras where you just click and it takes a picture.

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,280
There's no lens, there's no additional lens, there's no special add-ons.

64
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,919
It's a small rectangle and you just take normal pictures.

65
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,599
And that's the kind of camera that my mom uses.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,360
I have it in my purse and whatever.

67
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:31,560
It's just easy to use.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:43,659
But the digital SLR is a kind of camera that's like the old SLR where you have an attachment of a You have a body and you have a lens, and they're just much fancier.

69
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,560
And you have to do a lot more on your own to make a nice picture.

70
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,379
Now, SLR, that's an acronym.

71
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:50,439
Do you know what it stands for?

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,240
So an SLR is a single lens reflex camera.

73
00:03:54,539 --> 00:04:00,800
And that means that there's a lot more you have to do as the photographer to make sure that the picture comes out well.

74
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,520
Right, so it's really interesting because you can actually play with the lens.

75
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,319
Like the focus and how much light you want to allow it to go in.

76
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,379
And there's a lot of really, you know, sometimes a little bit difficult things that not many people understand.

77
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,240
Exactly, and so I think that's why it's good to do some research before you buy one because there's so many differences across the different cameras.

78
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:27,980
Okay, now both on digital SLRs and on point-and-shoot cameras, you have something that's called a display panel.

79
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:28,920
That's right.

80
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,600
So a display panel is usually covered in plastic.

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:41,879
And it's the area that tells you how many pictures you've taken, how many pictures you can take, if the flash is on, if you're doing an automatic setting.

82
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,040
So it's like the little computer monitor that tells you what's going on with the camera.

83
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,319
Usually after you take a picture, you can also see how it came out, right, in that moment.

84
00:04:51,759 --> 00:05:01,180
Exactly, and so a lot of times with these fancy cameras, you want to know how big the display panel is and how good the quality is in the display panel.

85
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,439
Because obviously if you take a picture and it shows up bad in the display panel, you want to take a new one.

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,459
But what if it's the display panel that's broken?

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,060
Right, right.

88
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,120
Okay, very good.

89
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:16,600
And that's actually one of the great advantages of digital cameras is that you can actually see how your picture looks like.

90
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,160
Exactly.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,879
In that moment.

92
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:18,959
Instant gratification.

93
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:19,759
Nice.

94
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,279
All right, now when she was looking to buy this digital SLR, she mentioned something about a kit lens.

95
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,060
Okay, this is fancy camera terminology, right?

96
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,540
Because if you buy a point-and-shoot, there's no lens.

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
It's just the camera.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,959
But if you're buying a fancy digital SLR, you can buy the body, which means the machine, but there's no lens.

99
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,939
So normally people will sell, stores will sell cameras with a kit lens.

100
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,199
That means they make a kit or they make a combination for you.

101
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,819
So it's the body and the lens.

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,379
Exactly.

103
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,740
But if you want, you can buy the body and the lens separate.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,680
Maybe you want a really fancy lens.

105
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:57,279
Exactly.

106
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,560
So what's the kind of fancy lens we might buy?

107
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,259
A telephoto lens.

108
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,759
Ooh, so these are the really big lenses for super close-up shots from a distance, right?

109
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:14,100
So you think of maybe professional photographers or photojournalists who have these kind of lenses.

110
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,740
They're big and they're bulky and they're not for traveling.

111
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,420
Usually you see them in like sporting events, right?

112
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,980
They're on the side of the field and they have these big white, they're usually white lenses on their cameras.

113
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,259
So you can actually take a very close picture of the action that's far away.

114
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Exactly.

115
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,220
And it's really good for those kind of things where you have action or where you're trying to get close-ups.

116
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:44,259
And now if one of these accessories that could go well with a telephoto lens or any digital SLR is a polarizing filter.

117
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:49,279
Okay, so a filter is something that takes certain elements out of something else.

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,680
So we can filter coffee, for example, and it takes the coffee grounds out and leaves the water.

119
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:04,060
But in a camera, a polarizing filter is something we put onto the glass of the lens to change the way that light goes into the lens.

120
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,660
Okay.

121
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:12,199
So in this way, you take a picture maybe of a very sunny day and it will look differently if you didn't have this filter.

122
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,839
Exactly.

123
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,699
And you can also have a UV filter, which does similar things with UV rays in the sunlight.

124
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:27,019
And these are just, filters are things you put on the camera and polarizing means that you're splitting up, right, the kind of light that goes in.

125
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,439
Okay.

126
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:28,399
Very good.

127
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:35,779
Very technical terms, but they're very useful, especially if you're looking to buy one of these cameras and you're not very familiar with the terms.

128
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:42,000
But why don't we move on now to some very interesting phrases that we saw in the dialogue on Fluency Builder.

129
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,800
Fluency Builder.

130
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:46,860
All right.

131
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:50,480
So on Fluency Builder, our first phrase today is entry level.

132
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,560
What's an entry level digital SLR?

133
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:52,899
Okay.

134
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,160
Well, entry level is something that we can use for any kind of purchase.

135
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,879
So any kind of thing that we buy.

136
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,199
In the case of a camera, an entry level is not for an expert or professional.

137
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,779
It's something for someone who's buying one for the first time.

138
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:08,639
Like for beginners.

139
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,379
For beginners.

140
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,959
So entry level is like entry, beginning, starting.

141
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,120
We can have an entry level job where you don't need training or experience, right?

142
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:23,980
An entry level camera where you don't need long experience with fancy cameras.

143
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,160
Or training to know how to use it.

144
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,899
Okay.

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,379
Very good.

146
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,360
So that's an entry level camera.

147
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,379
But as you mentioned, we can also use it for the job, an entry level job position.

148
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,240
All right.

149
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,980
What about our second phrase?

150
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,139
Okay.

151
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,820
So this one goes with the telephoto lens, right?

152
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,720
She says, I don't need a telephoto lens.

153
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,440
My husband doesn't need a telephoto lens.

154
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,539
It's not like he's going to be stalking celebrities.

155
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,220
Okay.

156
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,299
So we have this verb here to stock.

157
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,320
To stock.

158
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,899
That means to follow someone around and to look at them and to watch them and to not leave them alone.

159
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:04,799
Now she mentioned this because this is a very interesting and closely associated topic with photographers.

160
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:12,159
You know, you have the paparazzi who follow celebrities and they have these big telephoto lens so they can take pictures of celebrities without them knowing.

161
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,840
Exactly.

162
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:21,200
And so you imagine someone in a tree with a big telephoto lens taking a photo of someone famous who's, you know, half a mile away.

163
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,600
And stalking celebrities is something that's a bad thing, right?

164
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,059
Yeah, it's bad.

165
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:26,940
But it's very common.

166
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,700
And also illegal, I think.

167
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,399
And I think it's illegal.

168
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:29,620
All right.

169
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,019
And what about our last phrase?

170
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,139
Would you look at that?

171
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,179
Well, he said it in a very surprised tone, right?

172
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,440
Kind of like he didn't really expect to find the polarizing filters.

173
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Right.

174
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,220
So he's embarrassed.

175
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:42,700
Okay.

176
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,440
Would you look at that means, oh, wow, I'm surprised.

177
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:46,899
Right.

178
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:48,399
All right.

179
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,440
So it's awkward.

180
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,159
Right.

181
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,539
So you could say, Marco, you got a little bit of food on your shirt.

182
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,879
You've had it for like an hour.

183
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:57,759
Oh, my God.

184
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,740
Would you look at that.

185
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,259
That's really embarrassing.

186
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,159
I've got food on my shirt.

187
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,340
So this man, this man who works at the store, he's embarrassed because he didn't know something he should know.

188
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,779
Okay.

189
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,080
And so he says, oh, would you look at that.

190
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:12,980
How funny.

191
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:14,779
I didn't see those.

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,480
Now, we can also maybe use it in a sarcastic tone, right?

193
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,639
If I tell somebody, can you bring me my glasses that are on the table?

194
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,840
And they're like, I can't find them.

195
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:24,279
They're not here.

196
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:25,720
And then I find them.

197
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,899
Would you look at that?

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,759
Here they are.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,840
On your head the whole time.

200
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:30,480
That's my mom.

201
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:31,779
Would you look at that?

202
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,059
I was wearing my glasses the whole time.

203
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:35,519
All right.

204
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,100
Very good.

205
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,100
So why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk about digital SLRs.

206
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,960
Actually, I'm buying a camera for my husband.

207
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,259
Ah, well, then I'd recommend a nice entry level digital SLR.

208
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:13,059
Yeah?

209
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,419
Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

210
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:16,379
Sure thing.

211
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,019
Follow me.

212
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,100
This here is the...

213
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,720
The Canon EOS.

214
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:26,019
Yeah, it's okay, but I'm looking for something that performs better in low light, has a better display panel and longer battery life.

215
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,299
Oh, ah, the Nikon D60 is a nice option.

216
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,139
Yeah, but what kit lens does this camera come with?

217
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,480
I don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

218
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Ah, well, this one has the, uh...

219
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,299
Looks to me like an 18 to 55 millimeter lens.

220
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:42,100
Pretty standard.

221
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:42,840
That'll do.

222
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,919
Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything.

223
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,799
So, um, can I interest you in any accessories?

224
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Accessories?

225
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,200
Do you carry polarizing filters?

226
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:55,399
Polarizing filters.

227
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,200
Um, we should.

228
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,139
I'm sorry, ma'am.

229
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,539
Looks like we're sold out.

230
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,419
No, you're not.

231
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,799
There's some right here.

232
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,059
Oh, well, would you look at that.

233
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,700
Polarizing filters.

234
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,740
Thanks for your help, Ralph.

235
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:14,980
No problem, ma'am.

236
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,620
Alright, we're back.

237
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,799
So you mentioned you recently bought a digital SLR camera.

238
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,639
How's that working out?

239
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm loving it.

240
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,879
I have to actually train myself on how to use it because I used to have an old film camera that had...

241
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,240
It was actually a Nikon as well.

242
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,480
And it's different using a digital SLR.

243
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,500
There's a lot of things you can do that are very fancy because actually there's a computer inside, essentially.

244
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,860
So I'm getting used to it.

245
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:49,240
It's fun.

246
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:53,840
And what about the difference in pictures, like from a point and shoot to a digital SLR?

247
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,379
Does it really make a great difference?

248
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:56,779
Are you very happy with it?

249
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,059
There is a big difference.

250
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,519
And part of the difference is that you can control every aspect of the photo, okay?

251
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,440
So my digital camera was a small little Canon, you know, the little...

252
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,519
What are they called?

253
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,659
The power shoot?

254
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,480
And it took great pictures because, you know, these cameras have amazing pixel quality, right?

255
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,519
They have like 7.1 megapixels or like 9.1 megapixels.

256
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,200
So the quality is really good.

257
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,740
But everything looks the same.

258
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:33,539
If I have my digital camera, my digital SLR, I can frame a shot and I can focus on one person but make everyone else blurry.

259
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,019
I can really make more artistic photos whereas the point and shoot is great for parties and for...

260
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:40,940
Just like everyday stuff.

261
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,740
Everyday stuff, exactly.

262
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,580
Now what about traveling?

263
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,460
You have a dilemma there, right?

264
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,679
Because you visit very beautiful places where you would love to take very nice pictures with a digital SLR.

265
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,320
But at the same time, the inconvenience of it of actually...

266
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,019
Because they're pretty big.

267
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,019
All of them are pretty big.

268
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,659
So where would you go on that?

269
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,940
Would you use the point and shoot or the digital SLR?

270
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,899
Well, that's a good question.

271
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,600
One of the reasons that I picked the lens that I did is because it's not immense.

272
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,940
But I really want to be able to do some like landscape photography and I travel a lot.

273
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:17,240
So I think it's worthwhile to suck it up and just take the camera because otherwise why did you buy it, right?

274
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah, that's true.

275
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,779
Alright, so an interesting topic here on EnglishPod.

276
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:27,360
And I'm sure a lot of our users travel around, like to take pictures or maybe are experts on digital photography.

277
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,759
So why don't you come to the website EnglishPod.com.

278
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,639
We'll see you there and until next time.

279
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:33,200
Bye everyone.

280
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:33,519
Bye.
