EnglishPod.com Hello ma'am can I help you find something?

2
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:14,279
Yes actually I'm looking to buy a camera.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,980
We've got a wide selection Do you know if you'd like a point-and-shoot or something a little fancier?

4
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,879
Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else?

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,500
Actually I'm buying a camera for my husband Ah, well then I'd recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR.

6
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:30,280
Yeah?

7
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,679
Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

8
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,259
Sure thing, follow me.

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,340
This here is the...

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,979
The Canon EOS.

11
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:43,280
Yeah it's okay but I'm looking for something that performs better in low light has a better display panel and longer battery life.

12
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:47,539
Oh, ah, the Nikon D60 is a nice option?

13
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:50,420
Yeah but what kit lens does this camera come with?

14
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:52,740
I don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,700
Ah, well this one has the...

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,359
Looks to me like an 18 to 55 millimeter lens Pretty standard.

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,079
That'll do.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,240
Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything.

19
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,060
Haha so, um, can I interest you in any accessories?

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,540
Accessories?

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,439
Do you carry polarizing filters?

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,620
Polarizing filters?

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,019
Um, we...

24
00:01:14,019 --> 00:01:14,500

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,859
I'm sorry ma'am looks like we're sold out.

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,700
No you're not.

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,099

28
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,180

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,920
