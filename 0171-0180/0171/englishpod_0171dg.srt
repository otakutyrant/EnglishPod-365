EnglishPod.com Hello ma'am can I help you find something?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes actually I'm looking to buy a camera.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We've got a wide selection Do you know if you'd like a point-and-shoot or something a little fancier?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Actually I'm buying a camera for my husband Ah, well then I'd recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Can I take a look at the SLRs you carry?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Sure thing, follow me.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This here is the...

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Canon EOS.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah it's okay but I'm looking for something that performs better in low light has a better display panel and longer battery life.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, ah, the Nikon D60 is a nice option?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah but what kit lens does this camera come with?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't want some bulky telephoto lens.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ah, well this one has the...

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Looks to me like an 18 to 55 millimeter lens Pretty standard.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That'll do.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Haha so, um, can I interest you in any accessories?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Accessories?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Do you carry polarizing filters?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Polarizing filters?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Um, we...

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sorry ma'am looks like we're sold out.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No you're not.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
