00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:07,559
EnglishPod.com It's freezing in here.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,599
Can I turn up the heat?

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,660
Don't touch that thermostat.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,660
You don't pay the bills around here.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,259
Dad, are you serious?

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,940
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,019
Look, I can see my breath.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,579
Put on a sweater.

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,460
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

10
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,559
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

11
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:32,359
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

12
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,520
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,140
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

14
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,640
We never caught a cold.

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
You should be grateful.
