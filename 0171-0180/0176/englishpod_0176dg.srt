00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com It's freezing in here.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Can I turn up the heat?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Don't touch that thermostat.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You don't pay the bills around here.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Dad, are you serious?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Look, I can see my breath.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Put on a sweater.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We never caught a cold.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You should be grateful.
