00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Catherine and today we have a cold lesson.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's the winter season and of course it gets cold in a lot of different places around the world.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And so we're going to talk about heating.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, this is very important but before we do get started we have a very important word to preview in vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Alright, so we're going to preview the word freezing.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It is freezing today by the way so this is very appropriate.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Freezing means very, very, very cold.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, it is freezing.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, so it's very cold.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's freezing today.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's so cold in fact you can't have water outside because the water will become ice.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It will freeze.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, great word.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very first time.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's freezing in here.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can I turn up the heat?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't touch that thermostat.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You don't pay the bills around here.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Dad, are you serious?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Look, I can see my breath.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Put on a sweater.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We never caught a cold.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You should be grateful.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright, we're back and this is actually what a lot of dads are like I think around the world.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yep, my dad definitely liked to keep the heat low in our house.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright, so we'll talk about that a little bit later, but let's take a look at some four words on language takeaway today.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, this first word is important for anyone who has a home with heating.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's called a thermostat.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Alright, a thermostat.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is a thermostat?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A thermostat is a dial or like a device on the wall that tells you how hot or how cold the house is.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's like a thermometer for your house.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so you can move the thermostat, the temperature, to make the house warmer or colder, right?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Right, so if it says it's 20 degrees and I think that's too cold, I can turn the thermostat up to 23 degrees.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Alright, and well very much related to a thermostat and what this device does is our next word, central heating.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Right, so if you have central heating, you have a thermostat.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's the way to control the heat.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And central heating means that you have one heater for the whole house and so the air comes into all the different rooms.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So not many places in China have this, but for example in the United States, in Canada, it is very common.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, so your house or your apartment building will have central heating and then you can control how cold or warm the house is with thermostats.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Very good, and well our next word is related to temperature and it's chilly.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Chilly, okay, so there's a big difference between chilly and freezing.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Freezing means very, very, very cold.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Chilly means a little cold.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right, so it's a little cold.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a bit chilly.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right, so it's a bit chilly today, I'm going to wear a hat.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, if it's freezing, I'm going to wear a hat, a hat and mittens and a scarf and coat and boots.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright, so if it's a bit chilly, it's not very cold.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And well moving on, the dad mentioned about him having a furnace when he was young.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right, the dad had a furnace in his house and the furnace is a way to heat your house.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's like a stove.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So yeah, just consider it like a big oven, right?

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Maybe you've seen it in the old movies where you would have to throw firewood into the furnace to make it heat up the house.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Exactly, and so this is very common in older homes and not very common in apartments.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right, and well that's all the words we have for language takeaway today.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why don't we listen to this chilly dialogue again?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's freezing in here.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Can I turn up the heat?

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't touch that thermostat.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You don't pay the bills around here.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Dad, are you serious?

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look, I can see my breath.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Put on a sweater.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We never caught a cold.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You should be grateful.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright, we're back, so now we have prepared for you three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Fluency Builder Okay, so this first phrase is related to thermostat, okay?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So thermostat, like we said, is like a thermometer, but we can control the temperature.

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So if we want to make the temperature hotter, we turn up the thermostat.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, so this is a phrasal verb, to turn up, turn up the heat.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You could say this about heat.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You could say this about noise, too.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Can you turn up the radio?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Turn up the volume.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's to increase.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
To increase, to make bigger or warmer or louder.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Alright, and if we wanted to decrease the temperature in the thermostat, you would say...

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Turn down.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Turn down the heat.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Exactly.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So, it's too hot in here.

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Can you please turn down the heat?

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright, very good.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And our next phrase is, well, the dad was talking about the bills and how expensive it is to use a thermostat.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And he said, I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, so a bill is like, you know, something that you pay.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's money.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And so in this case, I don't want you to run up the bill.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That means to increase the amount of money I have to spend.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So maybe if you leave your television on all night, you're running up your electricity bill.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Exactly.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Or if you talk on the phone ten hours a day, you run up the phone bill and your mother kills you.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Right.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Alright, and well, the daughter was complaining about her catching a cold.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
To catch a cold.

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Alright, so remember this, a cold is when you have maybe a runny nose and a cough and a sore throat.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It usually happens when the weather changes, but we don't get a cold.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You catch a cold.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Remember like in baseball, you throw and catch.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's something that's fast.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright, so you catch a cold.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What about the flu?

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you get the flu or catch the flu?

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So you can't catch a flu, but you can catch a cold.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just remember this phrase, to catch a cold.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I caught the cold.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, to catch a cold or I caught a cold.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's almost like if I have it, I could throw it to you, Marco, and you catch it.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Right, because it's in the air, the virus and everything.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It passes very quickly.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Alright, very good.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So an interesting dialogue.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's listen to it one last time.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's freezing in here.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Can I turn up the heat?

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't touch that thermostat.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You don't pay the bills around here.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Dad, are you serious?

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look, I can see my breath.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Put on a sweater.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We never caught a cold.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You should be grateful.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, we're back.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You mentioned about thermostat and your dad actually controlling the heating at home.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Was this the case like this in this scenario?

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It was sometimes.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We'd have to wear more clothes because we didn't want to run up the bill.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But we had a special situation in my house because I'm from Chicago and it's very cold in the winters in Chicago.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But we had a fireplace.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Even if it was very cold, we always had firewood and we could put on the fire in the fireplace to keep warm.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So everyone would stay in the living room and read and listen to music and just relax.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I heard that because when you're burning wood, it causes some pollution.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In some cities it's banned to actually turn on or to have a fireplace.

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But in Chicago you can still do it.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Absolutely, and in most of the states you can.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Although a lot of people in new houses don't have real fireplaces, they have electric fireplaces.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So you can use a light switch to turn on your fire.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not a real fire, it's just a glowing light.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Alright, well very good.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is an interesting lesson, especially because the winter season is coming up and everyone is cold.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So we hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions, any doubts, you can come to our website EnglishPod.com.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We hope to see you there.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
