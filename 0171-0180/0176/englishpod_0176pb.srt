00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:05,059
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,740
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,140
And my name is Catherine and today we have a cold lesson.

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,119
That's right.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,239
It's the winter season and of course it gets cold in a lot of different places around the world.

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,379
And so we're going to talk about heating.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,679
Okay, this is very important but before we do get started we have a very important word to preview in vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,820
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,980
Alright, so we're going to preview the word freezing.

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,159
It is freezing today by the way so this is very appropriate.

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,899
Freezing means very, very, very cold.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,780
Okay, it is freezing.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,340
Okay, so it's very cold.

14
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,560
It's freezing today.

15
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,079
It's so cold in fact you can't have water outside because the water will become ice.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,979
It will freeze.

17
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,840
Okay, great word.

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:55,840
So let's listen to our dialogue for the very first time.

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,500
It's freezing in here.

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,540
Can I turn up the heat?

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,620
Don't touch that thermostat.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,599
You don't pay the bills around here.

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,180
Dad, are you serious?

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,900
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

25
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,939
Look, I can see my breath.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,500
Put on a sweater.

27
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,379
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

28
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,459
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

29
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,299
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,480
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,060
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,579
We never caught a cold.

33
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,019
You should be grateful.

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,500
Alright, we're back and this is actually what a lot of dads are like I think around the world.

35
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,219
Yep, my dad definitely liked to keep the heat low in our house.

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:58,239
Alright, so we'll talk about that a little bit later, but let's take a look at some four words on language takeaway today.

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,260
Well, this first word is important for anyone who has a home with heating.

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,139
It's called a thermostat.

39
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,919
Alright, a thermostat.

40
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,560
What is a thermostat?

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:21,759
A thermostat is a dial or like a device on the wall that tells you how hot or how cold the house is.

42
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,759
It's like a thermometer for your house.

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,039
Okay, so you can move the thermostat, the temperature, to make the house warmer or colder, right?

44
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:36,800
Right, so if it says it's 20 degrees and I think that's too cold, I can turn the thermostat up to 23 degrees.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:45,139
Alright, and well very much related to a thermostat and what this device does is our next word, central heating.

46
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:48,080
Right, so if you have central heating, you have a thermostat.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,400
That's the way to control the heat.

48
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:58,219
And central heating means that you have one heater for the whole house and so the air comes into all the different rooms.

49
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,759
So not many places in China have this, but for example in the United States, in Canada, it is very common.

50
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:13,780
Okay, so your house or your apartment building will have central heating and then you can control how cold or warm the house is with thermostats.

51
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,879
Very good, and well our next word is related to temperature and it's chilly.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Chilly, okay, so there's a big difference between chilly and freezing.

53
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,680
Freezing means very, very, very cold.

54
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,699
Chilly means a little cold.

55
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,659
Right, so it's a little cold.

56
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,500
It's a bit chilly.

57
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,520
Right, so it's a bit chilly today, I'm going to wear a hat.

58
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,819
Okay, if it's freezing, I'm going to wear a hat, a hat and mittens and a scarf and coat and boots.

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,500
Alright, so if it's a bit chilly, it's not very cold.

60
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,919
And well moving on, the dad mentioned about him having a furnace when he was young.

61
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,680
That's right, the dad had a furnace in his house and the furnace is a way to heat your house.

62
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,099
It's like a stove.

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,479
So yeah, just consider it like a big oven, right?

64
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,680
Maybe you've seen it in the old movies where you would have to throw firewood into the furnace to make it heat up the house.

65
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:14,539
Exactly, and so this is very common in older homes and not very common in apartments.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,339
Right, and well that's all the words we have for language takeaway today.

67
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,639
Why don't we listen to this chilly dialogue again?

68
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,420
It's freezing in here.

69
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,459
Can I turn up the heat?

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,540
Don't touch that thermostat.

71
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,519
You don't pay the bills around here.

72
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,100
Dad, are you serious?

73
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,800
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,860
Look, I can see my breath.

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,420
Put on a sweater.

76
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,300
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

77
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:49,399
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

78
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:54,220
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

79
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,399
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

80
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,000
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

81
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,480
We never caught a cold.

82
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,939
You should be grateful.

83
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:13,439
Alright, we're back, so now we have prepared for you three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

84
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:21,759
Fluency Builder Okay, so this first phrase is related to thermostat, okay?

85
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,980
So thermostat, like we said, is like a thermometer, but we can control the temperature.

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,680
So if we want to make the temperature hotter, we turn up the thermostat.

87
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,800
Okay, so this is a phrasal verb, to turn up, turn up the heat.

88
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,399
You could say this about heat.

89
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,120
You could say this about noise, too.

90
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,399
Can you turn up the radio?

91
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,420
Turn up the volume.

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,000
So it's to increase.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,839
To increase, to make bigger or warmer or louder.

94
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,639
Alright, and if we wanted to decrease the temperature in the thermostat, you would say...

95
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,439
Turn down.

96
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,579
Turn down the heat.

97
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,139
Exactly.

98
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,759
So, it's too hot in here.

99
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,519
Can you please turn down the heat?

100
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,800
Alright, very good.

101
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,620
And our next phrase is, well, the dad was talking about the bills and how expensive it is to use a thermostat.

102
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,300
And he said, I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill.

103
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,180
Okay, so a bill is like, you know, something that you pay.

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:12,980
It's money.

105
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,959
And so in this case, I don't want you to run up the bill.

106
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,339
That means to increase the amount of money I have to spend.

107
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,540
So maybe if you leave your television on all night, you're running up your electricity bill.

108
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:26,180
Exactly.

109
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,980
Or if you talk on the phone ten hours a day, you run up the phone bill and your mother kills you.

110
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:31,839
Right.

111
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,120
Alright, and well, the daughter was complaining about her catching a cold.

112
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,560
To catch a cold.

113
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,459
Alright, so remember this, a cold is when you have maybe a runny nose and a cough and a sore throat.

114
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,199
It usually happens when the weather changes, but we don't get a cold.

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,579
You catch a cold.

116
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,120
Okay.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,839
Remember like in baseball, you throw and catch.

118
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,920
It's something that's fast.

119
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,540
Alright, so you catch a cold.

120
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,379
What about the flu?

121
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,019
Do you get the flu or catch the flu?

122
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,100
So you can't catch a flu, but you can catch a cold.

123
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,319
Just remember this phrase, to catch a cold.

124
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,680
I caught the cold.

125
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,480
No, to catch a cold or I caught a cold.

126
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,620
It's almost like if I have it, I could throw it to you, Marco, and you catch it.

127
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,000
Right, because it's in the air, the virus and everything.

128
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,199
It passes very quickly.

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,399
Alright, very good.

130
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,759
So an interesting dialogue.

131
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,920
Let's listen to it one last time.

132
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,899
It's freezing in here.

133
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,959
Can I turn up the heat?

134
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,019
Don't touch that thermostat.

135
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,019
You don't pay the bills around here.

136
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,579
Dad, are you serious?

137
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,259
What's the point of having central heating if we can't use it?

138
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:44,319
Look, I can see my breath.

139
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,899
Put on a sweater.

140
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,779
I'm not going to let you run up my heating bill just because it's a bit chilly.

141
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,860
Dad, I'm going to catch a cold.

142
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,699
When I was your age, my parents didn't have central heating like you do.

143
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,879
We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it.

144
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,420
We used it to cook, heat the house, and even dry our clothes.

145
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,980
We never caught a cold.

146
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,519
You should be grateful.

147
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,519
Alright, we're back.

148
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,680
You mentioned about thermostat and your dad actually controlling the heating at home.

149
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,139
Was this the case like this in this scenario?

150
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,439
It was sometimes.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,360
We'd have to wear more clothes because we didn't want to run up the bill.

152
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,579
But we had a special situation in my house because I'm from Chicago and it's very cold in the winters in Chicago.

153
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,480
But we had a fireplace.

154
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:42,100
Even if it was very cold, we always had firewood and we could put on the fire in the fireplace to keep warm.

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,360
So everyone would stay in the living room and read and listen to music and just relax.

156
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:51,340
I heard that because when you're burning wood, it causes some pollution.

157
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,879
In some cities it's banned to actually turn on or to have a fireplace.

158
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,679
But in Chicago you can still do it.

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,820
Absolutely, and in most of the states you can.

160
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Although a lot of people in new houses don't have real fireplaces, they have electric fireplaces.

161
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,000
So you can use a light switch to turn on your fire.

162
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,139
It's not a real fire, it's just a glowing light.

163
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,200
Alright, well very good.

164
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,799
This is an interesting lesson, especially because the winter season is coming up and everyone is cold.

165
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:24,419
So we hope you enjoyed it and if you have any questions, any doubts, you can come to our website EnglishPod.com.

166
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
We hope to see you there.

167
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,840
