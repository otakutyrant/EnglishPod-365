00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,139
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,379
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,880
And today we're talking about something we talk about every year.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:21,280
Every year after Christmas or, well, during the Christmas holidays, we talk about New Year's, New Year's Day, and a very important topic, New Year's resolutions.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,559
All right.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,899
So we're not going to preview anything today.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,960
It's all in the dialogue.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,439
But when we come back, we'll be talking more about what you hear and some of the great phrases you can use at the New Year.

10
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,340
Did you read this?

11
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:48,939
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends and family.

12
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,219
Why would that be funny?

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,640
Well, think about it.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,280
We are a society that is always on the go.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,039
Not because we have to, but because we want to.

16
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:05,420
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,379
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution yourself.

18
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,599
What's the point?

19
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,560
We always make New Year's resolutions, and by February we will have forgotten about them.

20
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,260
It's pointless.

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
Well, maybe then you should resolve to stick into your goals and objectives.

22
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,180
What about you?

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,920
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.

24
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,760
Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

25
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,319
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,040
Alright, great, we're back.

27
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:46,480
So, this is very typical, a New Year's resolution that you make, but then people don't really stick to it, et cetera.

28
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:46,959
They don't?

29
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,700
Ah, usually they don't.

30
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:56,680
Alright, but you're probably wondering what is a New Year's resolution, so why don't we take a look at this word and many more on Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
Language Takeaway.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,379
Okay, so New Year's resolution, let's break this phrase down.

33
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:24,099
The first phrase is New Year's, so the New Year is January 1st in the West, and it is celebrated on the 31st of December at night when the clock changes to the New Year, and a New Year's resolution, remember that S there, is something that you want to do or to change in the New Year.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,939
It's a fresh start.

35
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:36,080
Okay, so you pretty much, the verb that you use there is to resolve to do something, so my New Year's resolution is to, you know, go to the gym every day.

36
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,879
It's like a promise to yourself.

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,819
Right, so, and this is very common, right, among Americans.

38
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,419
They try and, because it's a New Year, it's a fresh start, so they want to start doing something great.

39
00:02:46,419 --> 00:03:12,419
Exactly, we can talk about this at the end, but a lot of companies try to use this to sell Americans stupid things, so we'll get there in a minute, but the two people in this dialogue are talking about the idea of spending more time with friends and family, and the other person says, well, sometimes it's hard to do that because you have to provide your family with goods and services, so this phrase goods and services is very common, especially in economics and sociology, so what does this mean?

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,599
And they go together, right?

41
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,099
So goods are tangible items, things that you buy, you know, like food or, you know, clothes, a TV, etc.

42
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:21,780
Stuff.

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,419
Stuff.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,120
And services, of course, are other things like, for example, going to the doctor or the dentist or any other service you get.

45
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:43,699
So service usually includes another person doing something for you, but you might not actually get something physical like a TV if you pay for it, so goods and services, it's included in this phrase, always goods and services.

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:44,580
Very good.

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:54,139
And well, moving on, as we mentioned with the New Year's resolution, we had that verb there to resolve, so what does it mean if I want to resolve?

48
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,539
Okay, well, to resolve, as we said, is to decide or to promise yourself to do something.

49
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,860
So it's a decision that you don't want to change your mind about.

50
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,259
For example, I, this year, I've resolved to quit smoking.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,460
That means I've made a decision for myself and I'm going to do it.

52
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:15,520
Okay, very good.

53
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:15,979
Very strong.

54
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,899
And not to be confused with, like, to solve, right?

55
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,079
It has no real relation there, right?

56
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:30,959
No, resolve, to resolve to do something is to have a strong passion or interest in doing something for yourself or changing in action.

57
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,759
Very good.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,759
And well, our last word for language takeaway is brand new, a brand new, something that's brand new.

59
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,819
Brand new, so buy a brand new car, come down to Catherine's Car Lot.

60
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,480
So brand new is something we hear a lot in marketing.

61
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,319
It's also something that, well, these words just go together very often.

62
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:57,839
And something is new, okay, you just bought it or it just came out, but something that's brand new is really fresh, really new.

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,779
So brand new, a brand new car, a brand new watch, et cetera, a brand new movie.

64
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,620
A brand new movie or brand, yeah, brand new cereal.

65
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,680
Have you ever tried it?

66
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,000
Very good.

67
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,120
So, great phrases there.

68
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,339
Very good.

69
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,459
So great words there.

70
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,600
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with three phrases.

71
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,860
Did you read this?

72
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,480
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends and family.

73
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:32,720
Why would that be funny?

74
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,180
Well, think about it.

75
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,540
We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to.

76
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,079
Why?

77
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:48,060
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

78
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,920
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution yourself.

79
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,100
What's the point?

80
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,079
We always make New Year's resolutions, and by February we will have forgotten about them.

81
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,779
It's pointless.

82
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,300
Well, maybe then you should resolve to stick into your goals and objectives.

83
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,699
What about you?

84
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,360
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.

85
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:14,240
Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

86
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,839
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

87
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,319
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at these three phrases on Fluency Builder.

88
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,759
Fluency Builder.

89
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:33,060
Okay, this first phrase is very common at gas stations and fast food chains.

90
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,060
We say, on the go.

91
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,959
All right, so he mentioned that we are a society that is always on the go.

92
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,379
It means we're always moving.

93
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:53,420
Exactly, so you're always going to work, going home from work, going to the store, going to the school to get the kids, always moving, moving, moving, so that kind of action, that kind of life is on the go.

94
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,100
You can also say, eat on the go.

95
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:00,279
That means I eat while I'm going somewhere, while I'm doing something, I don't sit down.

96
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,379
Okay, so on the go.

97
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:09,959
And well, talking about New Year's resolution, and we say that, well, many people resolve to do something, but they don't really do it.

98
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:16,120
And we have a phrase that is used here, to stick to something, stick to your resolution.

99
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,019
To stick to it.

100
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,279
So you think of tape or glue, these things that help things stick together.

101
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:31,139
Okay, so in that sense, it's kind of a, it's a way for you to describe continuing to do something or not stopping, not quitting, not ending it.

102
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:34,500
And so I could say, remember how I said I wanted to quit smoking?

103
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,199
Well, I'm really going to stick to this resolution, because I think it's important.

104
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,680
That means I'm not going to give up.

105
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,519
Right, very good.

106
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,220
So you're going to stay with it, you're not going to give up.

107
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,740
All right, so stick to something, like, for example, our English learners, they'll stick to learning English.

108
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,639
And we could say as words of encouragement, hey, stick to it.

109
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,720
Stick to it, don't give up.

110
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,620
Keep with it, don't give up.

111
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,079
All right.

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:06,199
And, well, finally, they were discussing or more arguing about the gym membership and everything, and he mentioned that the gym bag is gathering dust.

113
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,300
All right, this is a very nice phrase, I think, because it's very visual.

114
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,740
I like phrases where you can see what's happening.

115
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,939
So gathering means collecting.

116
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:22,980
That means that the dust in the air, it's building on this bag, and something is gathering dust if we don't use it.

117
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:28,160
So we haven't gone to the gym because our bag is in the corner and it's just filled with dust.

118
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:28,959
Exactly.

119
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,800
We could also say this about the computer.

120
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,820
Why should I buy you a new computer, Marco, if you never use the old one?

121
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,519
That's just sitting in the house gathering dust.

122
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,279
Very good.

123
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:38,840
Okay.

124
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,340
So it's another way of saying you never use it, you never do it, et cetera.

125
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,460
It's for an object, though.

126
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,039
You can't say you are gathering dust.

127
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,019
Well, that'd be a little weird.

128
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,679
You might be dead or something.

129
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:48,659
All right.

130
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,419
Great phrases.

131
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,740
So why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

132
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,559
Did you read this?

133
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:09,159
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends and family.

134
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,460
Why would that be funny?

135
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,860
Well, think about it.

136
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:17,279
We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:17,799
Why?

138
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:25,639
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

139
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,620
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution yourself.

140
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:31,820
What's the point?

141
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,799
We always make New Year's resolutions and by February we will have forgotten about them.

142
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,480
It's pointless.

143
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,039
Well, maybe then you should resolve to stick into your goals and objectives.

144
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:42,379
What about you?

145
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,100
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.

146
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:51,960
Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

147
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,580
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

148
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,720
All right, we're back.

149
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:12,159
And well, as you mentioned, there were some interesting things about this dialogue, especially when they talked about a society that is always on the go and you mentioned that, well, sometimes you eat on the go.

150
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,200
And I've seen people in the United States that are actually eating while driving.

151
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,320
I'm guilty of doing that.

152
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,860
You have no time to actually sit down for like 15 minutes and eat.

153
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,779
Now, I remember being in high school at home and you know, you just have so much stuff to do.

154
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:43,259
You have school, then after school there's like, you know, soccer practice, after that there's music lessons and you never have time to eat so you have to grab food in the car and then on the way home you're picking things up and you get home and you do your homework or whatever, there's so much stuff to do and it doesn't stop.

155
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,840
It doesn't stop when you grow up, it doesn't stop if you're an older person, it's the way life is in America.

00:10:49,240 --> 00:11:03,259
Wow, yeah, that's really interesting because I think many of our listeners that are in other countries would find that a little bit peculiar if they actually went to the United States and saw somebody in their car, you know, like having a hamburger while driving, you know, and sipping on their soda.

157
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,139
Yeah, it's kind of sad, actually.

158
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Well, that's the thing, you don't have much time.

159
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:19,940
But actually this is based on true events, kind of, on the fact that many Americans do want to spend more time at home with their friends, with their family because, as you say, you're always so busy.

160
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:29,740
And I think it's a nice resolution to resolve to have dinner with your family once or twice a week at home where you sit down and you talk about your lives.

161
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:36,360
It's nice because you get to share and you get to know each other better, you know, otherwise you're always just on the go in different places.

162
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,179
Yeah, exactly.

163
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:44,779
