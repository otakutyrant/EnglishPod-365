00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,699
Did you read this?

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,260
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends and family.

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,539
Why would that be funny?

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:18,960
Well, think about it.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:24,379
We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:24,899
Why?

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,899
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

8
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,740
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution yourself.

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,899
What's the point?

10
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,880
We always make New Year's resolutions, and by February we will have forgotten about them.

11
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,579
It's pointless.

12
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,119
Well, maybe then you should resolve to stick into your goals and objectives.

13
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,500
What about you?

14
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:55,200
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,060
Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,619
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
