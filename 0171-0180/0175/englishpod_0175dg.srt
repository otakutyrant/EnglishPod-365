00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Did you read this?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It says that the number one New Year resolution people make is to spend more time with friends and family.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Why would that be funny?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, think about it.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a New Year's resolution yourself.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What's the point?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We always make New Year's resolutions, and by February we will have forgotten about them.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's pointless.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, maybe then you should resolve to stick into your goals and objectives.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What about you?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me every day.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
