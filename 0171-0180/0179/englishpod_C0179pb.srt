00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And my name is Catherine, and it's the holiday season, so that means more Christmas songs for you guys.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And today we're gonna be taking a look at a very famous song, very relaxed, but very beautiful song called Silent Night.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, this is one of those songs that you hear everywhere, but unlike Jingle Bells, which is like, Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, not, you know, very cheery and uplifting and shopping music.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is more, as Marco said, calm, peaceful, almost church music.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So we're going to find out what the words mean in this very classic song.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right, it's classic and very religious because it has a connotation towards the Catholic religion.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So why don't we listen to the song, and then we'll be back to explain it.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Round, young virgin, mother and child, holy infant, so tender and mild.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All right, we're back.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So now let's take a look at this song line by line.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So we're not going to do the standard format of picking out words.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We're going to do it line by line to kind of get a good feel for this dialogue.

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So first of all, some background.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, so the 24th, the evening, Mary and Joseph are looking for a place to stay.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mary, the virgin mother of God, is going to give birth to a baby.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Right.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And they need a place to stay, so finally they find a place.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not a hotel, it's not a house, it's...

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's like an inn.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, well, it's actually the stables for the inn, right?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Stables for the inn, yeah.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so what the song is celebrating is what happens afterwards, after the baby Jesus is born.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So that's the way we are.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So the first line says, silent night, holy night.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
As you know, it's holy.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That means it's religiously special.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's important.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All is calm, all is bright.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So we talk about bright lights sometimes.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Something as bright if it gives a lot of light off.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And, well, the next line is very interesting because it says, round yawn, virgin mother and child.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now, you see these first two words there, round yawn.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What is round yawn?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So round comes from around.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yawn means over there.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So, around over there, so over there we've got two people, okay?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Over there we've got the virgin mother and her child.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, so the virgin mother is Mary, right?

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And the child would be Jesus.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And this is holy infant, so tender and mild.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, so what is an infant?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
An infant is a baby.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Some baby that's just been born.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So we can say that infants are very, very delicate.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You have to be very careful when you hold an infant.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But in this case, a holy infant is Jesus.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's special for religious reasons.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And when they say that he's tender and mild, what does he mean by that?

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, you talk about tender things when you're talking about things that are soft, okay?

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Delicate, gentle or sweet.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And something that is mild or someone that is mild is very quiet and calm and gentle.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So not making much noise.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So the baby is very sweet, very tender and wasn't crying or making a big, you know, fuss.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And then we have sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, the baby's quiet because the baby is sleeping.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So you're saying sleep in heavenly peace.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That means, you know, may the peace of heaven, because heaven is a very peaceful place, the most peaceful place, may that peace be with you when you're sleeping.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, very good.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And moving on, we have silent night, holy night again.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But then they say shepherds quake at the sight.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So what is this?

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Shepherds, we know that these are people that take care of sheep.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
They make the sheep move from one place to another.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But it says they quake at the sight.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So they quake at the sight of what?

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, quake, we often say quiver in one's boots.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So to quake means to shake when you're nervous.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, so you know when you're going to make a speech in front of many, many, many people, your hands start to shake?

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's called quaking.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So to quake.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All right.

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So shepherds quake, they're nervous at the sight.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, the sight is the noun for seeing something.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The sight of Jesus.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The baby.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The baby.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Glories stream from heaven afar.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So glories stream from heaven afar.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, the verb here, the action word is to stream.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
To stream.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, that means to come down.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, so to come down in kind of big amounts.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So we have glory, glory.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So happiness and joy and glory and good things coming down from the heavens.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So lots of positive, good things coming down from heaven.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And where is heaven?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Afar.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Afar.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So the key part of this is the word far.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's far away, right?

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Afar is an old word we use to describe something that's far away.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So the heavens afar or the heavens that are far away are giving us all of this joy and happiness.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And then the song says, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So heavenly hosts, those are bodies or people or spirits in the sky, angels.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They're singing Alleluia.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So Alleluia is a word that we often use in the Christian religion that comes from Greek actually.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh really?

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So Alleluia is a Greek word and it means celebrate, joy, amen.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Alleluia.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's something you're happy about.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Alleluia.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Alleluia.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And then they say Christ, the Savior is born.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Now we have this, the Savior.

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is it?

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Who is a Savior?

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What is a Savior?

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a very good question.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The Savior is a word we only really, well, we don't hear that often, but you've heard the word to save before.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So for example, I fell into the water and Marco jumped in and saved me.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So I would be a Savior?

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Marco was my Savior.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He saved me.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But in this case, Savior refers to the Bible and the things that Jesus did later.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So we say in Christianity, he saved people, the humankind.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So he is the Savior.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All right.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Christ the Savior.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then our next verse, it says a silent night, holy night, son of God loves pure light, radiant beams from thy holy face.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So we have radiant beams and then we have this word thy.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So these beams is like a beam of light, right?

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's like a line of light, but you know how light is clear.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So a beam of light is something that comes down in a straight line.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can see it.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can see it.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So for example, when I turn on a flashlight and there's a line of light, that's a beam.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And radiant means it's very bright, it's very clear.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Clear and it's strong and it's coming out from that one place.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And what about this word thy?

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's very popular, like old English, right?

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's an old English form of saying?

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You.

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So in the olden days in English, we had different ways of saying the word you, okay?

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And so thy is one of those words and you hear this very often.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And so in this sentence, we're saying radiant beams from thy holy face.

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We're now starting to talk to Jesus because we're referring to him, you, radiant beams, light is coming out of your face.

156
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your holy face.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because you're such a holy.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Now, I think you can probably see this thy and thou in Shakespeare, for example, right?

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Exactly.

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Shakespeare, the Bible, prayers, and all sorts of old books and poetry.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then we say with the dawn of redeeming grace.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So what is to redeem?

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
To redeem is to find value in something that didn't have value before.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so maybe I have a ticket for some, okay, I won a small lottery ticket, $5.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I go to the store to redeem my money.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The paper is worthless.

169
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But it's worth something when I redeem it.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So Christ the Redeemer, when he saves people, he redeems them.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He gives them value again.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Very good.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's a very profound song, right?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And it talks about, as we say, about Jesus, about angels, and it's very, very religious.

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it's a great song, and it's, well, it's a very popular song.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And well, even if you don't share the religious connotation that the song has, it still is very popular in North America and many parts of the world.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So why don't we have a listen to this song one last time?

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Silent night.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Silent night.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Holy night.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Holy night.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All is calm.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
All is bright.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Round young virgin, mother and child Oh, the infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace So when I was a little girl at school we had to sing this in German So I know that there are some other countries that have the same song with different words Oh really?

186
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So it's the same rhythm and everything but just in German And is it pretty much the same idea, the same words?

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, almost exactly the same, just in translated form Maybe it came from German, I don't know Because it seems to be pretty old, right?

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But it is a very common song during Christmas And even many times Christmas carolers will go around in the neighborhood And sing these songs in different places, right?
