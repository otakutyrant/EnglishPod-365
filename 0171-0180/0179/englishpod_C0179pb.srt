00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,740
And my name is Catherine, and it's the holiday season, so that means more Christmas songs for you guys.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,660
That's right.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:21,300
And today we're gonna be taking a look at a very famous song, very relaxed, but very beautiful song called Silent Night.

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:32,619
Yeah, this is one of those songs that you hear everywhere, but unlike Jingle Bells, which is like, Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, not, you know, very cheery and uplifting and shopping music.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,979
This is more, as Marco said, calm, peaceful, almost church music.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,399
So we're going to find out what the words mean in this very classic song.

9
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,820
Right, it's classic and very religious because it has a connotation towards the Catholic religion.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,020
So why don't we listen to the song, and then we'll be back to explain it.

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:21,980
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright.

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:44,120
Round, young virgin, mother and child, holy infant, so tender and mild.

13
00:01:46,719 --> 00:02:06,079
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

14
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,219
All right, we're back.

15
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,060
So now let's take a look at this song line by line.

16
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,719
So we're not going to do the standard format of picking out words.

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,879
We're going to do it line by line to kind of get a good feel for this dialogue.

18
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,120
So first of all, some background.

19
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:28,280
Okay, so the 24th, the evening, Mary and Joseph are looking for a place to stay.

20
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:32,439
Mary, the virgin mother of God, is going to give birth to a baby.

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:32,960
Right.

22
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:36,120
And they need a place to stay, so finally they find a place.

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,860
It's not a hotel, it's not a house, it's...

24
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,319
It's like an inn.

25
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,840
Yeah, well, it's actually the stables for the inn, right?

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,860
Stables for the inn, yeah.

27
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,860
And so what the song is celebrating is what happens afterwards, after the baby Jesus is born.

28
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,900
So that's the way we are.

29
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:50,639
All right.

30
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,039
So the first line says, silent night, holy night.

31
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,659
As you know, it's holy.

32
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,680
That means it's religiously special.

33
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,360
It's important.

34
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,379
All is calm, all is bright.

35
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,840
So we talk about bright lights sometimes.

36
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,960
Something as bright if it gives a lot of light off.

37
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:16,240
And, well, the next line is very interesting because it says, round yawn, virgin mother and child.

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,219
Now, you see these first two words there, round yawn.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,740
What is round yawn?

40
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,780
So round comes from around.

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,639
Yawn means over there.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,580
So, around over there, so over there we've got two people, okay?

43
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,219
Over there we've got the virgin mother and her child.

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,460
Okay, so the virgin mother is Mary, right?

45
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:36,879
That's right.

46
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,599
And the child would be Jesus.

47
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,240
And this is holy infant, so tender and mild.

48
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,520
Okay, so what is an infant?

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,020
An infant is a baby.

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,860
Some baby that's just been born.

51
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:53,000
So we can say that infants are very, very delicate.

52
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,580
You have to be very careful when you hold an infant.

53
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,099
But in this case, a holy infant is Jesus.

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,520
He's special for religious reasons.

55
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:01,939
Okay.

56
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,360
And when they say that he's tender and mild, what does he mean by that?

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
Well, you talk about tender things when you're talking about things that are soft, okay?

58
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,099
Delicate, gentle or sweet.

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:12,960
Okay.

60
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,560
And something that is mild or someone that is mild is very quiet and calm and gentle.

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,939
So not making much noise.

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,759
So the baby is very sweet, very tender and wasn't crying or making a big, you know, fuss.

63
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,620
And then we have sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.

64
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,920
Well, the baby's quiet because the baby is sleeping.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,300
So you're saying sleep in heavenly peace.

66
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,740
That means, you know, may the peace of heaven, because heaven is a very peaceful place, the most peaceful place, may that peace be with you when you're sleeping.

67
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,139
Okay, very good.

68
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,040
Right.

69
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,339
And moving on, we have silent night, holy night again.

70
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,019
But then they say shepherds quake at the sight.

71
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,680
So what is this?

72
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,759
Shepherds, we know that these are people that take care of sheep.

73
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:58,699
That's right.

74
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,339
They make the sheep move from one place to another.

75
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,860
But it says they quake at the sight.

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,040
So they quake at the sight of what?

77
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,860
Well, quake, we often say quiver in one's boots.

78
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,379
So to quake means to shake when you're nervous.

79
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,500
Okay, so you know when you're going to make a speech in front of many, many, many people, your hands start to shake?

80
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,379
That's called quaking.

81
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,459
So to quake.

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,139
All right.

83
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,579
So shepherds quake, they're nervous at the sight.

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,279
Well, the sight is the noun for seeing something.

85
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,420
The sight of Jesus.

86
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:29,980
The baby.

87
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,060
The baby.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,459
Okay.

89
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,740
Glories stream from heaven afar.

90
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:37,680
So glories stream from heaven afar.

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,899
Okay, the verb here, the action word is to stream.

92
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,540
To stream.

93
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,600
Okay, that means to come down.

94
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:45,339
Okay.

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,259
Okay, so to come down in kind of big amounts.

96
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,600
So we have glory, glory.

97
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,879
So happiness and joy and glory and good things coming down from the heavens.

98
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:00,199
So lots of positive, good things coming down from heaven.

99
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,699
And where is heaven?

100
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:02,519
Afar.

101
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,639
Afar.

102
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,439
So the key part of this is the word far.

103
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:07,839
It's far away, right?

104
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,439
Afar is an old word we use to describe something that's far away.

105
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,740
So the heavens afar or the heavens that are far away are giving us all of this joy and happiness.

106
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,279
Okay.

107
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:22,240
And then the song says, heavenly hosts sing Alleluia.

108
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,019
So heavenly hosts, those are bodies or people or spirits in the sky, angels.

109
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,519
They're singing Alleluia.

110
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,579
So Alleluia is a word that we often use in the Christian religion that comes from Greek actually.

111
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,019
Oh really?

112
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:41,199
So Alleluia is a Greek word and it means celebrate, joy, amen.

113
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,160
Okay.

114
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,199
Alleluia.

115
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,540
It's something you're happy about.

116
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,439
Alleluia.

117
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,519
Alleluia.

118
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,579
And then they say Christ, the Savior is born.

119
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,100
Now we have this, the Savior.

120
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:52,939
What is it?

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,860
Who is a Savior?

122
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,939
What is a Savior?

123
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,139
It's a very good question.

124
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,079
The Savior is a word we only really, well, we don't hear that often, but you've heard the word to save before.

125
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,220
So for example, I fell into the water and Marco jumped in and saved me.

126
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,680
So I would be a Savior?

127
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,000
Marco was my Savior.

128
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,920
He saved me.

129
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
But in this case, Savior refers to the Bible and the things that Jesus did later.

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,720
So we say in Christianity, he saved people, the humankind.

131
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,060
So he is the Savior.

132
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,779
All right.

133
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,519
Christ the Savior.

134
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,560
All right.

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:37,300
And then our next verse, it says a silent night, holy night, son of God loves pure light, radiant beams from thy holy face.

136
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,220
So we have radiant beams and then we have this word thy.

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,680
So these beams is like a beam of light, right?

138
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,040
It's like a line of light, but you know how light is clear.

139
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:52,040
So a beam of light is something that comes down in a straight line.

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,779
You can see it.

141
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,480
You can see it.

142
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,139
So for example, when I turn on a flashlight and there's a line of light, that's a beam.

143
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,879
And radiant means it's very bright, it's very clear.

144
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,199
Clear and it's strong and it's coming out from that one place.

145
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:05,920
Okay.

146
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:07,740
And what about this word thy?

147
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:11,459
It's very popular, like old English, right?

148
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,139
It's an old English form of saying?

149
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:13,660
You.

150
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,139
You.

151
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:14,779
Right.

152
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,120
So in the olden days in English, we had different ways of saying the word you, okay?

153
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,600
And so thy is one of those words and you hear this very often.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,720
And so in this sentence, we're saying radiant beams from thy holy face.

155
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:38,059
We're now starting to talk to Jesus because we're referring to him, you, radiant beams, light is coming out of your face.

156
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,059
Your holy face.

157
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:39,639
Because you're such a holy.

158
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:39,700
Okay.

159
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:46,980
Now, I think you can probably see this thy and thou in Shakespeare, for example, right?

160
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,539
Exactly.

161
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,860
Shakespeare, the Bible, prayers, and all sorts of old books and poetry.

162
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,299
And then we say with the dawn of redeeming grace.

163
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,620
So what is to redeem?

164
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,000
To redeem is to find value in something that didn't have value before.

165
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:05,759
Okay.

166
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:12,379
Okay, so maybe I have a ticket for some, okay, I won a small lottery ticket, $5.

167
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,919
I go to the store to redeem my money.

168
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,440
The paper is worthless.

169
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,440
But it's worth something when I redeem it.

170
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,159
So Christ the Redeemer, when he saves people, he redeems them.

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,759
He gives them value again.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,340
Very good.

173
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's a very profound song, right?

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,200
And it talks about, as we say, about Jesus, about angels, and it's very, very religious.

175
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,139
So it's a great song, and it's, well, it's a very popular song.

176
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:49,960
And well, even if you don't share the religious connotation that the song has, it still is very popular in North America and many parts of the world.

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,220
So why don't we have a listen to this song one last time?

178
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:22,720
Silent night, holy night, all is calm, all is bright.

179
00:10:22,720 --> 00:11:16,759
Round young virgin, mother and child Oh, the infant so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace So when I was a little girl at school we had to sing this in German So I know that there are some other countries that have the same song with different words Oh really?

180
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:22,220
So it's the same rhythm and everything but just in German And is it pretty much the same idea, the same words?

181
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:29,700
Yeah, almost exactly the same, just in translated form Maybe it came from German, I don't know Because it seems to be pretty old, right?

182
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:41,159
But it is a very common song during Christmas And even many times Christmas carolers will go around in the neighborhood And sing these songs in different places, right?
