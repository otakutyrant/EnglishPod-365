00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Honey, I'll be right back.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Where are you going?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I told you already, I'm going to get my nails done.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Again?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You just went last week.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You should come with me.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They don't only paint my nails.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, sounds like something I should definitely do.
