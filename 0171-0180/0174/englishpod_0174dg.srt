00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:07,120
EnglishPod.com Honey, I'll be right back.

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,619
Where are you going?

3
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:11,759
I told you already, I'm going to get my nails done.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,380
Again?

5
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,259
You just went last week.

6
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,640
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,559
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,620
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,920
You should come with me.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,519
Why?

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,820
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,620
They don't only paint my nails.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,619
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,200
Yeah, sounds like something I should definitely do.
