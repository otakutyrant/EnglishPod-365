00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Katherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you guys out there.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we are going to talk about an interesting topic, especially for women.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We are going to the nail salon.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to get our fingernails painted.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's take a look at vocabulary preview to find out what nail salon means.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All right.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So if you go to a nail salon, it's a specific place where they paint your nails, right?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Exactly.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So it's a shop or a store where you can have your nails painted.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So they have special people to help you.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you want to go get your hair cut, you would go to the hair salon.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Exactly.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So we have hair salon and nail salon.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In this case, at the nail salon, they can't cut your hair.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Very good.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time?

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Honey, I'll be right back.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Where are you going?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I told you already.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to get my nails done.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Again?

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You just went last week.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself, and my nails look great.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You should come with me.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Why?

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They don't only paint my nails.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sounds like something I should definitely do.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right, we're back.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So now we found some very interesting and specific words related to nails.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So why don't we look at those now on Language Takeaway?

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All right.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So this first word is an important word for every woman to know, and I know a lot of men who get this too.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's called a manicure.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All right.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Manicure.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And what exactly is a manicure?

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, a manicure is a service that you get at a nail salon, and that means that the people at the nail salon will cut your nails and shape your nails.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That means if you want them to be pointy or boxy, and then you get them painted and dried.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So they basically take care of your nails, of your fingernails, a manicure.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Exactly.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And so the important thing to remember here that a manicure is for your hands.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Right.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So you can also get your toenails or your feet taken care of, right?

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Exactly.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So that's different.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's a pedicure because peda means foot.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So pedicure is for your feet, and a manicure is for your hands.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All right.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Very good.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And well, we talked about painting your nails, and that paint has a specific name, right?

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Exactly.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So you wouldn't use wall paint on your fingers, would you?

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So you have to use a special paint, and this is called nail polish.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Nail polish.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So a polish is something that makes a surface or a thing shiny.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Okay.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So nail polish is a paint that makes your nails very shiny.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
All right.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Very good.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And well, moving on, we talked about a manicure, and there's a specific word for the person that provides this service, that takes care of your nails.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So the job at a nail salon is manicurist.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's the person who paints your nails.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay?

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
All right.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And so you could say, I have a favorite manicurist.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Her name is Sally.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Very good.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And well, manicurists, they perform a manicure, and well, apart from painting your nails, they also push your cuticles or remove your cuticles, like in the dialogue.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are the cuticles?

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Cuticle is a very hard word.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This word describes the skin around your fingernail.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay?

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So you have skin all over your body, but on your fingernail, you have special kind of skin.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And so a manicurist will sometimes push or cut the dead skin, that's the cuticle, from your finger.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Very good.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So if you look at your fingernails now, you will see a little thin layer of skin on your fingernail.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's the cuticle.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And well, apart from removing your cuticles and painting your nails, they will also file your nails.

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And this is a verb, to file.

100
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
To file.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So this is a word that's kind of like cut or trim, but a file is a more delicate process.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So it means that we kind of shave off very, very, very little at a time.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And so to file your nails means to make them shaped differently or to smooth them.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
They're not cutting.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Clip, clip, clip.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not that.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a little bit less than that.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And now there's also a noun for this, a nail file.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And most women will usually have it.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a long piece of cardboard that has a paper that's kind of like sand on it, kind of like sandpaper.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It doesn't feel good when you rub it with your hand.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
With your hand.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But if you use it on your nails, it will little by little just take away little parts of your nail.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Like that.

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You usually see it, the many secretaries, you know, in TV shows, they're always filing their nails.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Exactly.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Making them perfect.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So those are the words we have for Language Takeaway.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit.

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Honey, I'll be right back.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Where are you going?

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I told you already, I'm going to get my nails done.

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Again?

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You just went last week.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You should come with me.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why?

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
They don't only paint my nails.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sounds like something I should definitely do.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All right, we're back.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So now why don't we start with some phrases, some very good phrases that we found in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This first phrase is really important when we talk about nails because it's the way that we describe going to the nail salon.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So I can say, I'm going to get my nails done today.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So to get your nails done, that means that you're going to get your nails cut, filed, painted, et cetera.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to get a manicure, but that's very, I don't know, serious.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So you could say I'm going to get my nails done.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's more spoken language.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay.

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So I'm going to get my nails done or you got your nails done.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Very good.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And well, the woman was talking about why she likes to go get a manicure and she said that she likes to pamper herself.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is very common, especially when women are trying to talk about why they spend money on hair and nails and clothes.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They say, I like to pamper myself.

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
To pamper means to treat very, very well.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So if you go get a manicure, it's kind of like pampering yourself or maybe going to a spa.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Exactly.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Or getting a massage.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And so we could say also, don't pamper the dog.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's very naughty.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So a synonym would be to spoil.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
To spoil oneself, to pamper.

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Indulge.

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So and well, she was talking about how they perform a manicure and she talked about four coats of nail polish.

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So a coat, we know that it's kind of like a jacket, right?

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But in this case?

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In this case, it means a layer.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So you paint your nails one time, okay?

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You have color.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Maybe it doesn't look right.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay.

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's very thin.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So you say, okay, I'm going to paint two coats and then you paint one more time and the color gets darker and you paint one more time and the color gets very dark and very thick.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And so these are called coats.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That means layers of nail polish and that's a special where we use when we're talking about painting our nails.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right.

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So it's not only for nails but if you're painting your house, maybe you need two or three coats of paint.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Exactly.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If we have a red wall and we want to paint it white, we definitely need two, three, maybe four coats of paint.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Otherwise we'll still see the red.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Uh-huh.

181
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, very good.

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Very interesting phrases.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's take a look at this dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back shortly.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Honey, I'll be right back.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Where are you going?

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I told you already, I'm going to get my nails done.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Again?

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You just went last week.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

192
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You should come with me.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why?

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They don't only paint my nails.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sounds like something I should definitely do.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right, we're back.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So, uh, Catherine, are you a big fan of manicures?

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you get it done often?

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I didn't used to, but I really enjoy them now.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it's a nice way to relax on the weekends, so every couple of weeks I go to the nail salon and I have my nails, I get my nails done.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
All right.

205
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I think one of the words that we didn't talk about here, but it's very, I don't know, for men it's kind of a strange smell is nail polish remover.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The acetone, right?

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a very strong chemical.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It is really disgusting.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Nail polish remover, you know, the word to remove means to take away.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And so when the nail polish, we want to change the color, we have to use this.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's like water, but it smells really bad.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And so my boyfriend always gets angry when I use the nail polish remover because the whole house starts to stink.

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a very strong smell and you get kind of dizzy.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So that's a lie.

215
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, it goes into your head.

216
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
