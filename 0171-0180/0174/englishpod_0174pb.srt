00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,900
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,240
And my name is Katherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you guys out there.

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,099
That's right.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,500
Today we are going to talk about an interesting topic, especially for women.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,739
We are going to the nail salon.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,760
Okay.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,820
So we're going to get our fingernails painted.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:23,739
All right.

10
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:28,839
So let's take a look at vocabulary preview to find out what nail salon means.

11
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:31,179
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:32,439
All right.

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:38,079
So if you go to a nail salon, it's a specific place where they paint your nails, right?

14
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:39,140
Exactly.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,020
So it's a shop or a store where you can have your nails painted.

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,859
So they have special people to help you.

17
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,920
If you want to go get your hair cut, you would go to the hair salon.

18
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:49,780
Exactly.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,619
So we have hair salon and nail salon.

20
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,659
In this case, at the nail salon, they can't cut your hair.

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,259
Okay.

22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,159
Very good.

23
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time?

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,340
Honey, I'll be right back.

25
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:09,840
Where are you going?

26
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,140
I told you already.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm going to get my nails done.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,579
Again?

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,480
You just went last week.

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,859
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,780
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,840
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself, and my nails look great.

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,140
You should come with me.

34
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:27,780
Why?

35
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:31,040
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

36
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,819
They don't only paint my nails.

37
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,840
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:38,760
Yeah.

39
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,439
Sounds like something I should definitely do.

40
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,680
All right, we're back.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,219
So now we found some very interesting and specific words related to nails.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,480
So why don't we look at those now on Language Takeaway?

43
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,040
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:00,379
All right.

45
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,959
So this first word is an important word for every woman to know, and I know a lot of men who get this too.

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,319
It's called a manicure.

47
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,819
All right.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Manicure.

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,219
And what exactly is a manicure?

50
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:21,639
Well, a manicure is a service that you get at a nail salon, and that means that the people at the nail salon will cut your nails and shape your nails.

51
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:28,520
That means if you want them to be pointy or boxy, and then you get them painted and dried.

52
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:29,240
Okay.

53
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:33,819
So they basically take care of your nails, of your fingernails, a manicure.

54
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:34,379
Exactly.

55
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,120
And so the important thing to remember here that a manicure is for your hands.

56
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:38,780
Right.

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,939
So you can also get your toenails or your feet taken care of, right?

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,719
Exactly.

59
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,879
So that's different.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,939
That's a pedicure because peda means foot.

61
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,219
So pedicure is for your feet, and a manicure is for your hands.

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:51,699
All right.

63
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,300
Very good.

64
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:58,780
And well, we talked about painting your nails, and that paint has a specific name, right?

65
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,780
Exactly.

66
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,240
So you wouldn't use wall paint on your fingers, would you?

67
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,199
So you have to use a special paint, and this is called nail polish.

68
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:09,139
Nail polish.

69
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:09,539
Okay.

70
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,120
So a polish is something that makes a surface or a thing shiny.

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:15,879
Okay.

72
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:15,979
Okay.

73
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:19,139
So nail polish is a paint that makes your nails very shiny.

74
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:19,740
All right.

75
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,300
Very good.

76
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:29,500
And well, moving on, we talked about a manicure, and there's a specific word for the person that provides this service, that takes care of your nails.

77
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:30,159
Okay.

78
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,659
So the job at a nail salon is manicurist.

79
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,740
That's the person who paints your nails.

80
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,180
Okay?

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,560
All right.

82
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,680
And so you could say, I have a favorite manicurist.

83
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,159
Her name is Sally.

84
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay.

85
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,780
Very good.

86
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:55,560
And well, manicurists, they perform a manicure, and well, apart from painting your nails, they also push your cuticles or remove your cuticles, like in the dialogue.

87
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,259
What are the cuticles?

88
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:57,860
Okay.

89
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,419
Cuticle is a very hard word.

90
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,020
This word describes the skin around your fingernail.

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,500
Okay?

92
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,939
So you have skin all over your body, but on your fingernail, you have special kind of skin.

93
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:18,160
And so a manicurist will sometimes push or cut the dead skin, that's the cuticle, from your finger.

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:18,839
Okay.

95
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,360
Very good.

96
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,959
So if you look at your fingernails now, you will see a little thin layer of skin on your fingernail.

97
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,660
That's the cuticle.

98
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:35,040
And well, apart from removing your cuticles and painting your nails, they will also file your nails.

99
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,480
And this is a verb, to file.

100
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:37,720
To file.

101
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,220
Okay.

102
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:45,360
So this is a word that's kind of like cut or trim, but a file is a more delicate process.

103
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,720
So it means that we kind of shave off very, very, very little at a time.

104
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,360
And so to file your nails means to make them shaped differently or to smooth them.

105
00:04:58,579 --> 00:04:59,500
They're not cutting.

106
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:00,319
Clip, clip, clip.

107
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,019
It's not that.

108
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,259
It's a little bit less than that.

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,259
And now there's also a noun for this, a nail file.

110
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,379
And most women will usually have it.

111
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,759
It's a long piece of cardboard that has a paper that's kind of like sand on it, kind of like sandpaper.

112
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,899
It doesn't feel good when you rub it with your hand.

113
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:18,480
With your hand.

114
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:23,399
But if you use it on your nails, it will little by little just take away little parts of your nail.

115
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:26,120
Like that.

116
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,939
You usually see it, the many secretaries, you know, in TV shows, they're always filing their nails.

117
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:32,480
Exactly.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,399
Making them perfect.

119
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,139
Okay.

120
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,899
So those are the words we have for Language Takeaway.

121
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,560
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit.

122
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,579
Honey, I'll be right back.

123
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,399
Where are you going?

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,540
I told you already, I'm going to get my nails done.

125
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:53,339
Again?

126
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,220
You just went last week.

127
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,600
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

128
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,519
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

129
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,579
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,920
You should come with me.

131
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:07,639
Why?

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,959
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

133
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,819
They don't only paint my nails.

134
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,819
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,740
Yeah.

136
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,459
Sounds like something I should definitely do.

137
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,959
All right, we're back.

138
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:32,560
So now why don't we start with some phrases, some very good phrases that we found in this dialogue in Fluency Builder.

139
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:42,759
This first phrase is really important when we talk about nails because it's the way that we describe going to the nail salon.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,639
So I can say, I'm going to get my nails done today.

141
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,220
Okay.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,620
So to get your nails done, that means that you're going to get your nails cut, filed, painted, et cetera.

143
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,100
I'm going to get a manicure, but that's very, I don't know, serious.

144
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,939
So you could say I'm going to get my nails done.

145
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,279
It's more spoken language.

146
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:01,699
Okay.

147
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,379
So I'm going to get my nails done or you got your nails done.

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,399
Very good.

149
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,240
And well, the woman was talking about why she likes to go get a manicure and she said that she likes to pamper herself.

150
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

151
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:22,500
This is very common, especially when women are trying to talk about why they spend money on hair and nails and clothes.

152
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,680
They say, I like to pamper myself.

153
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,860
To pamper means to treat very, very well.

154
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,540
Okay.

155
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,879
So if you go get a manicure, it's kind of like pampering yourself or maybe going to a spa.

156
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:33,779
Exactly.

157
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:34,680
Or getting a massage.

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,040
And so we could say also, don't pamper the dog.

159
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,180
He's very naughty.

160
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,120
So a synonym would be to spoil.

161
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,560
To spoil oneself, to pamper.

162
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,399
Indulge.

163
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:54,939
So and well, she was talking about how they perform a manicure and she talked about four coats of nail polish.

164
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,180
So a coat, we know that it's kind of like a jacket, right?

165
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,839
But in this case?

166
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,660
In this case, it means a layer.

167
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,740
So you paint your nails one time, okay?

168
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,000
You have color.

169
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,480
Maybe it doesn't look right.

170
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,040
Okay.

171
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,759
It's very thin.

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:17,060
So you say, okay, I'm going to paint two coats and then you paint one more time and the color gets darker and you paint one more time and the color gets very dark and very thick.

173
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,579
And so these are called coats.

174
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:23,980
That means layers of nail polish and that's a special where we use when we're talking about painting our nails.

175
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,399
Right.

176
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,300
So it's not only for nails but if you're painting your house, maybe you need two or three coats of paint.

177
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:29,980
Exactly.

178
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:37,299
If we have a red wall and we want to paint it white, we definitely need two, three, maybe four coats of paint.

179
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,879
Otherwise we'll still see the red.

180
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:39,360
Uh-huh.

181
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,340
Okay, very good.

182
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,919
Very interesting phrases.

183
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,100
Let's take a look at this dialogue for the very last time and we'll be back shortly.

184
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,639
Honey, I'll be right back.

185
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:56,120
Where are you going?

186
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,259
I told you already, I'm going to get my nails done.

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:08:59,860
Again?

188
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,759
You just went last week.

189
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,139
You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home.

190
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,059
Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?

191
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,120
Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself and my nails look great.

192
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,399
You should come with me.

193
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,039
Why?

194
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,500
I don't want to have nail polish or anything like that.

195
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,100
They don't only paint my nails.

196
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:24,100
The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least four coats of nail polish.

197
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,039
Yeah.

198
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:27,799
Sounds like something I should definitely do.

199
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:35,399
All right, we're back.

200
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,980
So, uh, Catherine, are you a big fan of manicures?

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,019
Do you get it done often?

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,639
I didn't used to, but I really enjoy them now.

203
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:50,500
I think it's a nice way to relax on the weekends, so every couple of weeks I go to the nail salon and I have my nails, I get my nails done.

204
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,059
All right.

205
00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:01,100
And I think one of the words that we didn't talk about here, but it's very, I don't know, for men it's kind of a strange smell is nail polish remover.

206
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,600
The acetone, right?

207
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:04,840
It's a very strong chemical.

208
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,539
It is really disgusting.

209
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,100
Nail polish remover, you know, the word to remove means to take away.

210
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,139
And so when the nail polish, we want to change the color, we have to use this.

211
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,340
It's like water, but it smells really bad.

212
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:24,500
And so my boyfriend always gets angry when I use the nail polish remover because the whole house starts to stink.

213
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,860
It's a very strong smell and you get kind of dizzy.

214
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,840
So that's a lie.

215
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,659
Yeah, it goes into your head.

216
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:38,240
