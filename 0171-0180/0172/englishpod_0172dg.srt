EnglishPod.com Thank God you are open!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I have an emergency!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello Mr.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Henderson, what can I do for you?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I need this dress and this suit dry-cleaned ASAP.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
OK, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No, you don't understand.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I need this tomorrow morning.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
She's gonna kill me!

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
OK, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Fine.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Certainly.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Great.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is our secret.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.
