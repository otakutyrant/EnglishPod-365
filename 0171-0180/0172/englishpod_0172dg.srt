EnglishPod.com Thank God you are open!

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,880
I have an emergency!

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,019
Hello Mr.

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,480
Henderson, what can I do for you?

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,399
I need this dress and this suit dry-cleaned ASAP.

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:19,379
OK, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,339
No, you don't understand.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,460
I need this tomorrow morning.

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,079
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,379
She's gonna kill me!

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,100
OK, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,399
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

13
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:38,159
Fine.

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,200
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:41,979
Certainly.

16
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:42,939
Great.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,039
This is our secret.

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,060
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.
