00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,179
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,599
And my name is Catherine, and today we have a very exciting elementary lesson for you.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,619
That's right.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,420
We are going to take our clothes to the dry cleaners.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,620
Okay, so that means we have some dirty clothes.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,120
They need to be cleaned.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,899
Let's listen to this dialogue one time, and when we come back, we'll be talking about the words and phrases that you hear in it.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,979
Thank God you are open.

10
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,380
I have an emergency.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,539
Hello, Mr.

12
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:38,799
Henderson.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,020
What can I do for you?

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,920
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Okay, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

16
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:48,859
No, you don't understand.

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,979
I need this tomorrow morning.

18
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,619
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress, and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,920
She's going to kill me.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,619
Okay, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

21
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,939
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,680
Fine.

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,739
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,480
Great.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,579
This is our secret.

26
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:14,599
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.

27
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:26,420
All right, we're back, so now there are probably a couple of words that you didn't understand, so why don't we look at those now in language takeaway.

28
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:29,939
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:37,540
Marco, you already told our listeners about one phrase, to dry clean, so dry cleaned.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,859
All right, so that's when you take your clothes to a professional who doesn't only wash them.

31
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,340
You don't just put water and soap on it.

32
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:53,620
They actually put some special chemicals and use special machines to get very hard to remove stains from it.

33
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,400
Exactly, and so this is often what we use when we clean coats or fancy shirts and dresses, because you don't want to clean those yourself.

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,280
Right, you can't put those in the washing machine.

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,019
No, so this is the dry cleaner.

36
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,960
That's the name of the place, and the action, what they do is they dry clean clothes.

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, very good.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,060
All right, well, I mentioned that we take them to the dry cleaners because we want to remove stains.

39
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:24,159
Okay, so a stain is a mark or some color that does not come off, does not go away.

40
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,300
All right, so for example, sometimes you can have a wine stain.

41
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,080
Ooh, wine stains are the worst.

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,900
They're red and they never come off, or a blood stain.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,819
Or blood stain.

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,400
Ooh.

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,000
Right, so a stain is a noun, but you can also use it as an adjective.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,759
My shirt is stained.

47
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay, so it's stained.

48
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,879
My pants are stained and I can't wear them again.

49
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,539
Again, now you can also use it as a verb.

50
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,180
I stained my pants.

51
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:51,840
All right.

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,460
So it's a verb, it's a noun, and an adjective, all in one.

53
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,520
Easy to remember.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,460
Well, there's another word that's related to this word.

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,580
We spilled something, okay?

56
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,319
So I spilled wine and it stained my shirt.

57
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,759
Okay, so to spill.

58
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:11,379
And that means that you took some liquid and you put it onto your clothes.

59
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,460
Or you dropped it and it made a mess.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,939
Okay, so spill.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,539
I spilled some milk.

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,580
Okay, spilled.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,360
Now it's pronounced differently from spell, right?

64
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,099
That's right.

65
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,699
Spill.

66
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,199
It has an I, spilled.

67
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,460
All right, now our next word is also a noun and a verb, to iron.

68
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,080
To iron means to make something flat with no lines, okay?

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,759
To smooth it out.

70
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,240
So we use an iron to iron.

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,080
Right, exactly.

72
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,080
It's a metal electronic object.

73
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,280
It gets very hot.

74
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,960
So you wash your shirts, for example, and your shirts are wrinkled because you just washed them.

75
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,800
So you need to iron them.

76
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:50,479
That's right.

77
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,319
And so you smooth them out, you flatten them with this object, an iron.

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,159
And well, usually if you take them to the dry cleaners, they will iron them and also starch them.

79
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:11,900
Okay, so to starch something means to use some powder or chemical to make something stiff or hard.

80
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,680
So the noun or the chemical is also called starch.

81
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,959
So you think of a shirt with many buttons that a man wears to work.

82
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:26,459
He has a collar around his neck and that needs to be high and tall.

83
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,439
It can't be flat and wrinkled.

84
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,899
And so a dry cleaner will use starch to make sure that this stands up.

85
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,180
Okay, very good.

86
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,839
So those are five key words for the dialogue today.

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

88
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,860
Thank God you were open.

89
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,240
I have an emergency.

90
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,399
Hello, Mr.

91
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,899
Henderson, what can I do for you?

92
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:57,779
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP.

93
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,819
Okay, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

94
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,720
No, you don't understand.

95
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,819
I need this tomorrow morning.

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,480
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

97
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,759
She's going to kill me.

98
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,500
Okay, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

99
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,800
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

100
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:19,579
Fine.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,259
Certainly.

103
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,300
Great.

104
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,439
This is our secret.

105
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,500
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.

106
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,420
All right, we're back now, so let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

107
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:36,540
Thank God.

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,060
Thank God.

109
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
All right, what is this phrase?

110
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,240
Thank God.

111
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,660
Okay, this is a phrase we use in English to say that we're happy about something or that we're relieved, okay?

112
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:51,740
So maybe I'm nervous that the mail isn't going to come today.

113
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,560
And then the mail comes and I say, oh, thank God the mail came.

114
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,720
I'm happy.

115
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,160
I was hoping it would come.

116
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:59,060
So you're relieved.

117
00:05:59,579 --> 00:05:59,980
Thank God.

118
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,540
Now, we are using the word there, God, but it doesn't really have a religious connotation that much, right?

119
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,060
No, not anymore.

120
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:08,660
No.

121
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,160
It's usually just a phrase.

122
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:11,240
Okay.

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,100
Now what about this acronym ASAP or ASAP?

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,540
ASAP, so as soon as possible.

125
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,959
It's an acronym, so the first letter comes from the word.

126
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,980
It means as soon as possible, very quickly, right away.

127
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,500
You always hear that in an office setting as well.

128
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:30,740
I need those papers ASAP.

129
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,259
I need those reports ASAP.

130
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:38,439
Exactly, so you can say it either way ASAP or ASAP, and it means immediately.

131
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,180
Okay.

132
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:46,540
And he said that he needed the suit ASAP, and he said, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

133
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:59,019
Okay, so that might not be fast enough for the client, for the person here who has the stain, but the end of the week is a very, very useful phrase because it means that maybe today is Monday or Tuesday.

134
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:07,259
By Friday or Saturday, we'll have this ready for you because we think of the end of the week as Friday maybe, Thursday, Friday.

135
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,800
So I can say the end of the week or the end of the day.

136
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,560
Exactly, the end of the month.

137
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,860
Or the end of the year.

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,639
Exactly.

139
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,779
So the end of is usually the last time, so thank goodness it's the end of the week.

140
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,199
I'm ready for my weekend.

141
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:25,980
Very good.

142
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,879
Okay, so great phrases there as well.

143
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,360
Let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

144
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,699
I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP.

145
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,759
Okay, I can have it ready by the end of the week.

146
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,660
No, you don't understand.

147
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,740
I need this tomorrow morning.

148
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,399
I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife's dress, and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow.

149
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,660
She's going to kill me.

150
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,399
Okay, I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon, but this suit is also very stained.

151
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,720
I can't guarantee we can remove it completely.

152
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,500
Fine.

153
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,540
Can you also iron and starch this shirt?

154
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,259
Certainly.

155
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:15,220
Great.

156
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,360
This is our secret.

157
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,439
If you see my wife, say nothing to her about this.

158
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,620
All right, we're back.

159
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,699
So now dry cleaning, ironing.

160
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,819
Are you good at this, or do you get a lot of your clothes dry cleaned?

161
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,399
I'm pretty good at this actually.

162
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,659
I don't like to wash clothes.

163
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,039
I get really bored with the washing machine, but I actually really like ironing.

164
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:39,340
Really?

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,840
Yeah, I find it very relaxing.

166
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,360
Really?

167
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,100
Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,080
I usually find it very frustrating.

169
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,200
Why is that?

170
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:57,940
Because I can't really iron well, because I start on one side, and I'm getting all the lines out, and then the other side gets wrinkled, or lines appear where I don't want them to appear.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,279
It's very frustrating for me.

172
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,019
It is frustrating.

173
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,120
It takes some practice.

174
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,759
My suggestion is to use the spritzer.

175
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,879
In the iron, there's some water that can come out, like that.

176
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:16,059
Well, if you spray the water, it makes the lines go out for longer, right?

177
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,659
Because if you iron over that, it's more permanent.

178
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:27,100
I've also seen some sprays sometimes that you can spray your clothes with some special chemical that's not actually starch, but it helps remove the wrinkles quicker.

179
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,740
Exactly.

180
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,700
I don't use that.

181
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,279
I use water generally, but they're all available.

182
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,059
All right.

183
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,279
So that's all the time we have for today.

184
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:40,960
