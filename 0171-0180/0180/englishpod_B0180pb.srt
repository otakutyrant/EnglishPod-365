00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And my name is Catherine, and it's the holiday season.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's almost Christmas, and so we are bringing you one of the most typical Christmas songs for Christmas carols, I guess, in all over the world, probably.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right, and I've heard it in many different languages, even Chinese.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yeah, even Chinese.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Ding-dong-dang.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, I'll have to ask.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, you have to ask.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But yeah, we're talking about Jingle Bells today, so the famous song, Jingle Bells, you'll hear it everywhere, especially during the Christmas season, or only during the Christmas season.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Especially, yeah.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And so, let's listen to the song.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The song is pretty long, it has a couple of different verses, but we've taken the main one, the first one, and the chorus, which are the most famous ones.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So let's listen to the song.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh, o'er the fields we go, laughing all the way, bells on bob-bells ring, making spirits bright, what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse This is going to be stuck in my head all day, Marco.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I know, it's kind of catchy, though.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
How can you not get into the spirit with this song?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, as you said, a carol, a Christmas carol is a song, and they're meant to be catchy.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You get them in your head, and they stay there forever.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think it's also because every mall or shopping center you go to, they're playing these songs, so they just kind of get stuck in your head.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In the background all the time.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It makes you want to shop more.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Or kill someone.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, so there were probably a couple of different words that you didn't understand here, so we're going to go through the whole song, little by little, and we'll explain it.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So starting out with the first line, it says, dashing through the snow.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, okay, this is interesting because in sports, there's an event called a 100-meter dash.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, so a dash is a very quick run.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Very fast, right?

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So dashing through the snow is you're kind of running or going through the snow very quickly.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right, we don't know who is running through the snow, but we know something or someone is going very quickly through the snow.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And then the second line, it says, in a one-horse open sleigh.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, so now we know who's dashing through the snow.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a horse.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a horse, and you're in a sleigh.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, so an open sleigh means that there's no roof.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So you're sitting under the stars, and there's a horse pulling your sleigh through the snow.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, so a sleigh is kind of like a vehicle for the snow, right?

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There's no wheels, okay, because it's hard to drive in snow, and so this is an old kind of vehicle that has maybe wood or metal underneath to make it slide.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
To make it slide, very good.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
All right, and then we have this strange word here.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's O-apostrophe-E-R, or, or the fields we go.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Or the fields we go.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, this is very, very common in poetry, okay?

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So this is a way to make the word over shorter, because over, you can hear it two syllables, over.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But sometimes we only want one, so we say or.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, or the fields we go.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's over.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay, interesting.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Laughing all the way.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Bells on bobtails ring.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now, what are bobtails?

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What are these bells on bobtails?

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, well, bobtails are the tails of certain animals, okay?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So we could say we have a bunny rabbit with a bobtail.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That means the tail sticks up.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it's also maybe reindeer have bobtails, because their tails stick up.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can see them.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, so I guess in this case, because it's Christmas, these animals like reindeer and rabbits have little bells on them.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And according to the next line, making spirits bright.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So you're making people happy.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Spirit is your attitude or your soul.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And in this case, you're being made happy.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're happy because it's Christmas.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You're outside.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Very good.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And well, he says, what fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, sleighing, we know that sleigh is this vehicle to go through the snow, but a sleighing song, I guess, is...

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Is the song we sing when we're in a sleigh.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So this isn't a real word, but this is something that makes the song kind of, makes you think that these people are just singing a special song for being in a sleigh.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And now we go to the chorus.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jingle bells, jingle bells.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So this word jingle, it's a verb, right?

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To jingle, we can do it with your keys, too.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
To jingle is to make noise when metal is touching metal.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So we have bells and they ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
They hit each other.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I got some keys here.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I'll show you what jingling is.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So we go like this.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, jingle.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is to jingle your keys, right?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, exactly.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So you can use it with keys, with bells.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can you use it with anything else?

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Anything that makes it sound like that?

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Chimes, jingle.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, chimes, jingle.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
All right, very good.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So jingle all the way.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, what fun it is to ride again in a one-horse open sleigh.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So all the way, maybe we're going someplace.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All the way wherever you're going, right?

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From home or to dinner.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So the chorus is not very hard and neither is the first verse.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But, you know, sometimes the song is pretty fast.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So sometimes you don't really understand what they're saying.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Personally, I did not know the lyrics of jingle bells until we started doing this podcast.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, because when we sing it, we mumble.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You know, you can't hear all the words.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You don't know the words, but dashing through the snow.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sometimes you have to just think of it very clearly.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Very good.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So that's all the words we have for this podcast.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a very good Christmas carol.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's very catchy and I don't know how old it is.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I've heard it since I was small.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, probably old enough to come from a time when there weren't cars because there was sleigh.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And when they used or because I don't see people use or anymore.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No, I think it's mostly just songs and poems.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You see it a lot in the 19th century.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But it is interesting.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Also, I guess the relationship between like the sleighs and snow.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Christmas is always related to this even though, you know, in some places you don't have snow during Christmas.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But it does, I mean, we're here in Shanghai and we can hear people singing this song.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And there's no snow.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So I think it's just a way to think about the season of Christmas and the attitude of people when it's Christmas time.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Right.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If you have any questions about this Christmas carol, you can let us know on EnglishPod.com.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And we'll also post the other verses, the less known verses of Jingle Bells because it's actually a pretty long song.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Very long.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I don't know any of the other verses to be honest with you.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Exactly.

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's why we chose the first one and the chorus because it's the most popular one.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So we'll see you guys there and Merry Christmas.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Merry Christmas.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Bye.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Merry Christmas.
