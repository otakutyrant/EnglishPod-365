00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,179
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:09,539
And my name is Catherine, and it's the holiday season.

4
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,279
That's right.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:20,480
It's almost Christmas, and so we are bringing you one of the most typical Christmas songs for Christmas carols, I guess, in all over the world, probably.

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,100
That's right, and I've heard it in many different languages, even Chinese.

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:25,260
Yeah, even Chinese.

8
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:27,359
Ding-dong-dang.

9
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:29,179
Okay, I'll have to ask.

10
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,100
Yeah, you have to ask.

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:39,179
But yeah, we're talking about Jingle Bells today, so the famous song, Jingle Bells, you'll hear it everywhere, especially during the Christmas season, or only during the Christmas season.

12
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:39,560
Especially, yeah.

13
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,920
And so, let's listen to the song.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:52,460
The song is pretty long, it has a couple of different verses, but we've taken the main one, the first one, and the chorus, which are the most famous ones.

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,420
So let's listen to the song.

16
00:00:55,299 --> 00:01:12,079
Dashing through the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh, o'er the fields we go, laughing all the way, bells on bob-bells ring, making spirits bright, what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,840
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:30,099
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way, oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse This is going to be stuck in my head all day, Marco.

19
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,159
I know, it's kind of catchy, though.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,159
How can you not get into the spirit with this song?

21
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,640
Well, as you said, a carol, a Christmas carol is a song, and they're meant to be catchy.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,959
You get them in your head, and they stay there forever.

23
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:51,200
I think it's also because every mall or shopping center you go to, they're playing these songs, so they just kind of get stuck in your head.

24
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,299
In the background all the time.

25
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,120
Yeah, exactly.

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,900
It makes you want to shop more.

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,420
Or kill someone.

28
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:07,739
Alright, so there were probably a couple of different words that you didn't understand here, so we're going to go through the whole song, little by little, and we'll explain it.

29
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:11,139
So starting out with the first line, it says, dashing through the snow.

30
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:17,699
Well, okay, this is interesting because in sports, there's an event called a 100-meter dash.

31
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:20,639
Okay, so a dash is a very quick run.

32
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,840
Very fast, right?

33
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,300
That's right.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
So dashing through the snow is you're kind of running or going through the snow very quickly.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,819
Right, we don't know who is running through the snow, but we know something or someone is going very quickly through the snow.

36
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,680
And then the second line, it says, in a one-horse open sleigh.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,099
Okay, so now we know who's dashing through the snow.

38
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:40,719
It's a horse.

39
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,439
It's a horse, and you're in a sleigh.

40
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,900
Okay, so an open sleigh means that there's no roof.

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,840
So you're sitting under the stars, and there's a horse pulling your sleigh through the snow.

42
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:56,580
Okay, so a sleigh is kind of like a vehicle for the snow, right?

43
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:07,979
There's no wheels, okay, because it's hard to drive in snow, and so this is an old kind of vehicle that has maybe wood or metal underneath to make it slide.

44
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,379
To make it slide, very good.

45
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,419
All right, and then we have this strange word here.

46
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:16,520
It's O-apostrophe-E-R, or, or the fields we go.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,099
Or the fields we go.

48
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,960
Well, this is very, very common in poetry, okay?

49
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,139
So this is a way to make the word over shorter, because over, you can hear it two syllables, over.

50
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,039
But sometimes we only want one, so we say or.

51
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,199
Okay, or the fields we go.

52
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,539
It's over.

53
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,020
Okay, interesting.

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960
Laughing all the way.

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,780
Bells on bobtails ring.

56
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,340
Now, what are bobtails?

57
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,120
What are these bells on bobtails?

58
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,719
Okay, well, bobtails are the tails of certain animals, okay?

59
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,699
So we could say we have a bunny rabbit with a bobtail.

60
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,139
That means the tail sticks up.

61
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,659
But it's also maybe reindeer have bobtails, because their tails stick up.

62
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,379
You can see them.

63
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:06,740
Okay, so I guess in this case, because it's Christmas, these animals like reindeer and rabbits have little bells on them.

64
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:10,719
And according to the next line, making spirits bright.

65
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,800
So you're making people happy.

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,360
That's right.

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,399
Spirit is your attitude or your soul.

68
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,600
And in this case, you're being made happy.

69
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,060
You're happy because it's Christmas.

70
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:21,899
You're outside.

71
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,040
Very good.

72
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,060
And well, he says, what fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight.

73
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Now, sleighing, we know that sleigh is this vehicle to go through the snow, but a sleighing song, I guess, is...

74
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,279
Is the song we sing when we're in a sleigh.

75
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:44,779
So this isn't a real word, but this is something that makes the song kind of, makes you think that these people are just singing a special song for being in a sleigh.

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,220
All right.

77
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,759
And now we go to the chorus.

78
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,339
Jingle bells, jingle bells.

79
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,519
So this word jingle, it's a verb, right?

80
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,019
Yeah.

81
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,220
To jingle, we can do it with your keys, too.

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,360
To jingle is to make noise when metal is touching metal.

83
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,139
So we have bells and they ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

84
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:00,959
They hit each other.

85
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,759
I got some keys here.

86
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,740
And I'll show you what jingling is.

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,560
So we go like this.

88
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:03,879
Oh, jingle.

89
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,300
This is to jingle your keys, right?

90
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,920
Yeah, exactly.

91
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,860
So you can use it with keys, with bells.

92
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,459
Can you use it with anything else?

93
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,000
Anything that makes it sound like that?

94
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:12,199
Chimes, jingle.

95
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,560
Okay, chimes, jingle.

96
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,300
All right, very good.

97
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,300
So jingle all the way.

98
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,079
Oh, what fun it is to ride again in a one-horse open sleigh.

99
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,699
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
So all the way, maybe we're going someplace.

101
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,959
All the way wherever you're going, right?

102
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,839
From home or to dinner.

103
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,639
And oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

104
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,360
So the chorus is not very hard and neither is the first verse.

105
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,420
But, you know, sometimes the song is pretty fast.

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
So sometimes you don't really understand what they're saying.

107
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,759
Personally, I did not know the lyrics of jingle bells until we started doing this podcast.

108
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,839
Well, because when we sing it, we mumble.

109
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,319
You know, you can't hear all the words.

110
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,779
You don't know the words, but dashing through the snow.

111
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,079
Sometimes you have to just think of it very clearly.

112
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,800
Very good.

113
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,639
So that's all the words we have for this podcast.

114
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,019
It's a very good Christmas carol.

115
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,800
It's very catchy and I don't know how old it is.

116
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,540
I've heard it since I was small.

117
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,420
Well, probably old enough to come from a time when there weren't cars because there was sleigh.

118
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,579
And when they used or because I don't see people use or anymore.

119
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,019
No, I think it's mostly just songs and poems.

120
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,000
You see it a lot in the 19th century.

121
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:29,399
But it is interesting.

122
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:35,420
Also, I guess the relationship between like the sleighs and snow.

123
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,639
Christmas is always related to this even though, you know, in some places you don't have snow during Christmas.

124
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:41,199
That's right.

125
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,980
But it does, I mean, we're here in Shanghai and we can hear people singing this song.

126
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,379
And there's no snow.

127
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,800
So I think it's just a way to think about the season of Christmas and the attitude of people when it's Christmas time.

128
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,319
Right.

129
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,540
So I hope you enjoyed our lesson.

130
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,600
If you have any questions about this Christmas carol, you can let us know on EnglishPod.com.

131
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:06,720
And we'll also post the other verses, the less known verses of Jingle Bells because it's actually a pretty long song.

132
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:07,240
Very long.

133
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,560
And I don't know any of the other verses to be honest with you.

134
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,920
Exactly.

135
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:13,459
That's why we chose the first one and the chorus because it's the most popular one.

136
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,819
So we'll see you guys there and Merry Christmas.

137
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,899
Merry Christmas.

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:17,759
Bye.

139
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,620
Merry Christmas.
