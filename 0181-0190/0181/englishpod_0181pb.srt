00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:05,980
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:10,119
My name is Catherine, and we are your English language guides here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,640
That's right, and today we're going to be taking you to Christmas morning.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,759
It's Christmas Day.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,699
Oh, one of the best times of the year.

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:22,859
You wake up, you smell the good smell of delicious eggs and bacon, and there's presents.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,679
Yeah, I guess that's when you're a kid, though.

9
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:27,440
I guess when you're an adult, do you really get excited when you wake up for Christmas?

10
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:28,140
Hell yeah.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,859
Sure do.

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,299
Yeah, I sure do.

13
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,500
I love Christmas morning, even as an adult.

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,340
Especially, I think, because of the special breakfast you get, like pancakes, scrambled eggs.

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:49,140
But anyways, we're going to be taking a look at a situation here where a kid is opening Christmas presents, and we're preparing a meal for Christmas, because that day people are going to come over.

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,119
So, let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

17
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,459
Dad, Dad, Dad!

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,459
Wake up!

19
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,299
It's Christmas!

20
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,719
Timmy, it's too early for this.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,579
Look, it's six in the morning.

22
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,019
Go back to bed.

23
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:35,980
No way!

24
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:39,420
Santa already came and left all our presents.

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,359
Can we go open them, please?

26
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,060
Please?

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,700
Of course we can, honey.

28
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,299
Bill, come on, get dressed.

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,760
Fine.

30
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,500
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,959
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

32
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,359
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,180
Awesome!

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,799
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

35
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,580
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,659
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,060
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,099
I got the list right here.

39
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:23,539
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

40
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,639
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,580
Alright, we're back.

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,900
So there were a couple of different and interesting words there, so let's take a look at them now in language takeaway.

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,439
Language takeaway.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,800
Okay, this first word is not a very happy word.

45
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:54,979
It's a word that we try not to use too much around the Christmas season, but sometimes you're just tired of people, because the holidays is all about people and doing stuff.

46
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,340
Someone who's not being very happy, someone who's a little bit grumpy, is called a grouch.

47
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,879
Okay, so a person that's not very happy, not very friendly, is a grouch.

48
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,419
I don't want to open presents.

49
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,560
This is stupid.

50
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,379
Okay, that's a grouch.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,379
Okay, so a person is a grouch, or you can act like a grouch, or be a grouch.

52
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:18,340
Don't be a grouch!

53
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:18,840
Alright.

54
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,639
And, well, they were talking about heading to the market to buy something for dinner, so to head to.

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,580
Okay, to head to is a way to say to go towards someplace, or to go somewhere.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,139
Alright, so if I'm driving my car and you ask me where I'm going, I'm saying, oh, I'm heading to the bank.

57
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:42,379
Right, so to head to means to be on your way somewhere, I'm going somewhere.

58
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,039
It's a way to say that you're in the process of going.

59
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,240
You can't say, next year I will head to Alaska.

60
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,400
It doesn't make as much sense.

61
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:57,039
You usually say, you know, I'm heading to the bank, or let's head to the market.

62
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,159
And well, they were talking about heading to the market because they are hosting Christmas dinner.

63
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,840
So, to host.

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,000
To host is a, well, it's a very important holiday term.

65
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:17,600
It's a verb, you do it, and it means that you are the person who has the special dinner, and your friends and family, they come to your house.

66
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:25,079
Okay, so we could say, this Christmas, I'm hosting the dinner at my house, so I want everyone to come to my house and eat.

67
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:27,519
Alright, and it can also be a noun, right?

68
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,259
You can say, I am a host.

69
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:30,000
Exactly.

70
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:31,079
I'm the host of this dinner.

71
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,339
Right, and it doesn't have to be holidays either.

72
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:36,240
You could say, hey, Marco, how about you host a dinner next week?

73
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,879
I'll come.

74
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,639
Right, okay.

75
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,379
I'll bring wine.

76
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,620
Alright, so to host a dinner, or to host a party, et cetera.

77
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:51,399
And our fourth word for language takeaway is probably the most popular drink during the Christmas season, eggnog.

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,699
Okay, it sounds kind of disgusting.

79
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:55,779
Yeah, a drink with egg.

80
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,180
But it's a very popular, creamy, eggy drink.

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,120
It's very thick, and it's cream colored, and normally you add a little bit of rum, okay, to make it alcoholic.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:16,939
Yeah, and you drink it warm, and it's kind of just a thick, warm alcoholic beverage that's very, very popular, and my dad loves it.

83
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:18,120
During Christmas, right?

84
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:18,800
During Christmas.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,879
You don't have it like any other day.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,100
No, you wouldn't want to.

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,819
It's too heavy.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,779
But it's very, very popular like the days before Christmas and on Christmas.

89
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,379
Okay, so eggnog.

90
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,379
Very good.

91
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,279
So I think we should take a look at the dialogue again, and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,480
Dad, dad, dad!

93
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:41,519
Wake up!

94
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,319
It's Christmas!

95
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,720
Timmy, it's too early for this.

96
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Look, it's six in the morning.

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,040
Go back to bed.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,360
No way!

99
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,779
Santa already came and left all our presents.

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,740
Can we go open them, please?

101
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,480
Please?

102
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,339
Of course we can, honey.

103
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,920
Bill, come on, get dressed.

104
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,399
Fine.

105
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,120
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

106
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,660
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

107
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,519
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

108
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,379
Awesome!

109
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,600
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

110
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,379
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

111
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:21,459
Yeah, you're right.

112
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,879
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

113
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,879
I got the list right here.

114
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,319
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

115
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:37,439
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

116
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,379
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,879
Fluency Builder Okay, so this first phrase is a phrase that I often heard as a child because I never wanted to go to sleep.

118
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:59,139
So I'd go downstairs and my parents would say, Catherine, go back to bed.

119
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,240
Go back to bed.

120
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,500
Okay, go back to bed.

121
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,980
This is just a very common, colloquial, spoken way of saying, go back to sleep.

122
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:07,660
Go to sleep.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,540
Don't be awake.

124
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:16,360
So you can say, go to sleep, or you can say, go to bed, or if somebody has gotten out of bed, you say, go back to bed.

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,680
Exactly, and so parents often use this with their kids because they want their kids to sleep.

126
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,240
You can also say it about someone who's up at night worrying, and you say, come on, go back to bed.

127
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:26,800
Relax.

128
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,899
Go to sleep, relax.

129
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:28,500
Okay.

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,600
And then we also saw this phrase, knock yourself out.

131
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,600
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out.

132
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,139
So what is this?

133
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,220
Knock yourself out.

134
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,420
Well, I'm not really sure where this phrase comes from.

135
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,339
I mean, to knock is like to knock on a door, right?

136
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,439
But to knock yourself out, if I think about it, it probably means that you hit yourself in the head and you fall over.

137
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,379
But the real meaning of this is, go have fun, okay?

138
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,980
Have as much fun as you can have.

139
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,100
Right, have as much fun as you want.

140
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,339
Go knock yourself out.

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,600
So the parent is saying, hey, Timmy, go have as much fun as you want.

142
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,680
Just go do it.

143
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,660
Enjoy yourself.

144
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,980
Yeah, like go open all these presents.

145
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,139
Have all the fun you want.

146
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:20,040
All right, and then we saw another phrase when they finished talking about dinner and all the things they have to buy, they said, we should be set.

147
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,139
We should be set, or we are set.

148
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,879
Well, this is funny because she says, well, my dad's going to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

149
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,560
Which means we should have everything we need.

150
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,639
So we don't need anything else, we're ready, everything is good.

151
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,559
Exactly, so we can say we are set, I'm set, are you set?

152
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,620
It's a way to say, are you ready, are you prepared, do you have everything you need?

153
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,259
So I often use this when I'm going on a trip, I say, are you set, did you pack everything, are you all set?

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,460
Are you all set, yeah.

155
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,100
All right, I finished packing, I'm all set, I'm ready to go.

156
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:52,600
All set and ready to go.

157
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:53,159
All right.

158
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,899
Okay, so some interesting phrases there as well, why don't we have a look at our dialogue for the last time.

159
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,679
Dad, dad, dad, wake up, it's Christmas.

160
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:42,399
Timmy, it's too early for this, look, it's six in the morning, go back to bed.

161
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:49,559
No way, Santa already came and left all our presents, can we go open them, please, please.

162
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,720
Of course we can, honey, Bill, come on, get dressed.

163
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,860
Fine, not like Santa brought me any gifts.

164
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,379
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

165
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:10,539
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree, awesome.

166
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,980
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out, we should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

167
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,480
Yeah, you're right, it's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

168
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,899
I got the list right here, ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy and of course, yams.

169
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,080
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

170
00:10:40,379 --> 00:11:01,480
All right, we're back, so as you mentioned, Christmas morning is great, you open presents and, well, breakfast and it's a time to be together with your parents, your family, but as in this case, you can be a little bit of a grouch because you're just kind of tired because you had Thanksgiving in November and then Christmas and now you're having New Year's, so you're kind of just like, ugh.

171
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:19,240
Yeah, the holiday season can be exhausting and I know a lot of families have a special dinner on the 24th, that's Christmas Eve, and then by the time it's Christmas day, the 25th, you're exhausted, you didn't get any sleep, you might have had too much to drink last night, and so it can be very tiring.

172
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:23,860
Also because the kids always get up way too early, like six o'clock.

173
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:41,139
Right, to open their presents, right, and then they'll be playing with their toys all day and you'll have a headache, but it's a great season to spend time with the family and well, we want to know how you spend your Christmas Eve and your Christmas morning, so why don't you come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your questions and comments there as well.

174
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,899
We're looking forward to hearing from you, again, happy holiday season and until next time.

175
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,200
Bye.
