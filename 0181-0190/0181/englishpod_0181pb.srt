00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and we are your English language guides here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right, and today we're going to be taking you to Christmas morning.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's Christmas Day.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, one of the best times of the year.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You wake up, you smell the good smell of delicious eggs and bacon, and there's presents.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, I guess that's when you're a kid, though.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I guess when you're an adult, do you really get excited when you wake up for Christmas?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hell yeah.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Sure do.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah, I sure do.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I love Christmas morning, even as an adult.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Especially, I think, because of the special breakfast you get, like pancakes, scrambled eggs.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But anyways, we're going to be taking a look at a situation here where a kid is opening Christmas presents, and we're preparing a meal for Christmas, because that day people are going to come over.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Dad, Dad, Dad!

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wake up!

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Christmas!

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Timmy, it's too early for this.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Look, it's six in the morning.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Go back to bed.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No way!

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Santa already came and left all our presents.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Can we go open them, please?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Please?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Of course we can, honey.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Bill, come on, get dressed.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Fine.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Awesome!

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, you're right.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I got the list right here.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Alright, we're back.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So there were a couple of different and interesting words there, so let's take a look at them now in language takeaway.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Language takeaway.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, this first word is not a very happy word.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a word that we try not to use too much around the Christmas season, but sometimes you're just tired of people, because the holidays is all about people and doing stuff.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Someone who's not being very happy, someone who's a little bit grumpy, is called a grouch.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, so a person that's not very happy, not very friendly, is a grouch.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to open presents.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is stupid.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay, that's a grouch.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, so a person is a grouch, or you can act like a grouch, or be a grouch.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't be a grouch!

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Alright.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And, well, they were talking about heading to the market to buy something for dinner, so to head to.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, to head to is a way to say to go towards someplace, or to go somewhere.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Alright, so if I'm driving my car and you ask me where I'm going, I'm saying, oh, I'm heading to the bank.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right, so to head to means to be on your way somewhere, I'm going somewhere.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a way to say that you're in the process of going.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't say, next year I will head to Alaska.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It doesn't make as much sense.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You usually say, you know, I'm heading to the bank, or let's head to the market.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And well, they were talking about heading to the market because they are hosting Christmas dinner.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, to host.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
To host is a, well, it's a very important holiday term.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a verb, you do it, and it means that you are the person who has the special dinner, and your friends and family, they come to your house.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, so we could say, this Christmas, I'm hosting the dinner at my house, so I want everyone to come to my house and eat.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Alright, and it can also be a noun, right?

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can say, I am a host.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Exactly.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm the host of this dinner.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Right, and it doesn't have to be holidays either.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You could say, hey, Marco, how about you host a dinner next week?

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll come.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right, okay.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll bring wine.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Alright, so to host a dinner, or to host a party, et cetera.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And our fourth word for language takeaway is probably the most popular drink during the Christmas season, eggnog.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay, it sounds kind of disgusting.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, a drink with egg.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But it's a very popular, creamy, eggy drink.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's very thick, and it's cream colored, and normally you add a little bit of rum, okay, to make it alcoholic.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, and you drink it warm, and it's kind of just a thick, warm alcoholic beverage that's very, very popular, and my dad loves it.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
During Christmas, right?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
During Christmas.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You don't have it like any other day.

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, you wouldn't want to.

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's too heavy.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But it's very, very popular like the days before Christmas and on Christmas.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so eggnog.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Very good.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So I think we should take a look at the dialogue again, and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Dad, dad, dad!

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wake up!

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's Christmas!

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Timmy, it's too early for this.

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Look, it's six in the morning.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go back to bed.

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No way!

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Santa already came and left all our presents.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Can we go open them, please?

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please?

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course we can, honey.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Bill, come on, get dressed.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Fine.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Awesome!

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Alright, Timmy, knock yourself out.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, you're right.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I got the list right here.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at a couple of phrases on Fluency Builder.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Fluency Builder Okay, so this first phrase is a phrase that I often heard as a child because I never wanted to go to sleep.

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I'd go downstairs and my parents would say, Catherine, go back to bed.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go back to bed.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, go back to bed.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is just a very common, colloquial, spoken way of saying, go back to sleep.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Go to sleep.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't be awake.

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So you can say, go to sleep, or you can say, go to bed, or if somebody has gotten out of bed, you say, go back to bed.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Exactly, and so parents often use this with their kids because they want their kids to sleep.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can also say it about someone who's up at night worrying, and you say, come on, go back to bed.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Relax.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Go to sleep, relax.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then we also saw this phrase, knock yourself out.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So what is this?

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Knock yourself out.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, I'm not really sure where this phrase comes from.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I mean, to knock is like to knock on a door, right?

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But to knock yourself out, if I think about it, it probably means that you hit yourself in the head and you fall over.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But the real meaning of this is, go have fun, okay?

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Have as much fun as you can have.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right, have as much fun as you want.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Go knock yourself out.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So the parent is saying, hey, Timmy, go have as much fun as you want.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just go do it.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Enjoy yourself.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, like go open all these presents.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Have all the fun you want.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right, and then we saw another phrase when they finished talking about dinner and all the things they have to buy, they said, we should be set.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We should be set, or we are set.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, this is funny because she says, well, my dad's going to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Which means we should have everything we need.

150
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So we don't need anything else, we're ready, everything is good.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Exactly, so we can say we are set, I'm set, are you set?

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a way to say, are you ready, are you prepared, do you have everything you need?

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So I often use this when I'm going on a trip, I say, are you set, did you pack everything, are you all set?

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you all set, yeah.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
All right, I finished packing, I'm all set, I'm ready to go.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
All set and ready to go.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, so some interesting phrases there as well, why don't we have a look at our dialogue for the last time.

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Dad, dad, dad, wake up, it's Christmas.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Timmy, it's too early for this, look, it's six in the morning, go back to bed.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No way, Santa already came and left all our presents, can we go open them, please, please.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Of course we can, honey, Bill, come on, get dressed.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Fine, not like Santa brought me any gifts.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree, awesome.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out, we should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, you're right, it's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I got the list right here, ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy and of course, yams.

169
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:11:01,000
All right, we're back, so as you mentioned, Christmas morning is great, you open presents and, well, breakfast and it's a time to be together with your parents, your family, but as in this case, you can be a little bit of a grouch because you're just kind of tired because you had Thanksgiving in November and then Christmas and now you're having New Year's, so you're kind of just like, ugh.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, the holiday season can be exhausting and I know a lot of families have a special dinner on the 24th, that's Christmas Eve, and then by the time it's Christmas day, the 25th, you're exhausted, you didn't get any sleep, you might have had too much to drink last night, and so it can be very tiring.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Also because the kids always get up way too early, like six o'clock.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Right, to open their presents, right, and then they'll be playing with their toys all day and you'll have a headache, but it's a great season to spend time with the family and well, we want to know how you spend your Christmas Eve and your Christmas morning, so why don't you come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your questions and comments there as well.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're looking forward to hearing from you, again, happy holiday season and until next time.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Bye.
