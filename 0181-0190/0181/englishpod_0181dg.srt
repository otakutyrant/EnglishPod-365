EnglishPod.com Dad!

2
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,439
Dad!

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:32,920
Dad!

4
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:33,979
Wake up!

5
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:34,799
It's Christmas!

6
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:38,179
Timmy, it's too early for this.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,060
Look, it's six in the morning.

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,500
Go back to bed.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,460
No way!

10
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,899
Santa already came and left all our presents.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,859
Can we go open them, please?

12
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:49,659
Please?

13
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,200
Of course we can, honey.

14
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,799
Bill, come on, get dressed.

15
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:55,259
Fine.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,000
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,619
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

18
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,840
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,659
Awesome!

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,299
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out.

21
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:17,079
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,159
Yeah, you're right.

23
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,579
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

24
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,560
I got the list right here.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,040
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

26
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,079
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.
