EnglishPod.com Dad!

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dad!

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Dad!

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Wake up!

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's Christmas!

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Timmy, it's too early for this.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Look, it's six in the morning.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Go back to bed.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No way!

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Santa already came and left all our presents.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Can we go open them, please?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Please?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Of course we can, honey.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Bill, come on, get dressed.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Fine.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Not like Santa brought me any gifts.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Bill, honestly, you can be such a grouch sometimes.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Look at all these presents under the Christmas tree.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Awesome!

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
All right, Timmy, knock yourself out.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We should get ready and head to the market to buy everything for Christmas dinner tonight.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, you're right.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's the first time we're hosting Christmas dinner at our house, so everything has to be perfect.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I got the list right here.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ham, turkey, mashed potatoes, ingredients for the gravy, and of course, yams.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My dad offered to bring the eggnog, so we should be set.
