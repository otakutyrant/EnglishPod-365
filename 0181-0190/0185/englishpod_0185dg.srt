00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:08,099
EnglishPod.com Isn't this great?

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:13,060
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,120
This is very beautiful, though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,760
That's fine, don't worry about it.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,800
What was that?

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,640
Relax, it was just a goat.

7
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,019
And that?

8
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,960
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,320
We can milk them later.

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,200
What was that?

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,740
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

12
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:37,500
Relax.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,259
Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,359
You know what?

15
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,579
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

16
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:49,880
I'm going back to the city.
