00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Isn't this great?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is very beautiful, though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's fine, don't worry about it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What was that?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Relax, it was just a goat.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And that?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We can milk them later.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What was that?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Relax.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You know what?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm going back to the city.
