00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:13,039
My name is Katherine, and today we have a wild lesson for you at the elementary level.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:13,919
That's right.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,280
We are actually going to visit a farm.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,120
So yeah, it's going to be fun.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,839
We're going to see a lot of animals.

8
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,519
And not only that, but we're going to learn a lot of interesting words and phrases in English today.

9
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:29,359
But before we get started, let's take a look at Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,440
Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,619
Walt Macdonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.

12
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:38,740
And on his farm he had a duck, E-I-E-I-O.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,619
We're not going to be teaching you this song today, don't worry.

14
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,399
You don't have to listen to us sing.

15
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:46,159
We do have a great word to start us off.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,539
It's called, the word is country.

17
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,880
Okay, so you know country as like the United States, Mexico, Mexico, China, et cetera.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,600
But in this case, we are going out to the country.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Not out of the country, we're going out to the country.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,679
To the country, okay?

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,780
The country, or you might hear the countryside, is a place that's not like a city.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,760
So it's the opposite of city.

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:21,859
It means there's lots of grass, it's very natural, there are very, very few houses and people, it's very quiet.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,519
So it's the opposite of a busy city, it's the country.

25
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:30,459
And you have a lot of animals, so usually farms are found on the countryside, or at the countryside.

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,079
In the countryside.

27
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,420
So usually farms are found in the countryside.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,420
That's right, and I personally am a big fan because it's so quiet and peaceful, so we can talk about that in a minute.

29
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,379
Let's listen to today's dialogue first, and then we'll be back to talk about some of the words and phrases.

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,780
Isn't this great?

31
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,739
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,799
This is very beautiful, though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

33
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,439
That's fine, don't worry about it.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,479
What was that?

35
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,319
Relax, it was just a goat.

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,699
And that?

37
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,659
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

38
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,020
We can milk them later.

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,900
What was that?

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,419
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,219
Relax.

42
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,960
Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

43
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,060
You know what?

44
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,280
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

45
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,580
I'm going back to the city.

46
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,199
All right, we're back, so obviously some people cannot go to the countryside.

47
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,759
That's right.

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,580
Some people get very, very upset.

49
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:56,139
In fact, there was a whole TV show in America that was about city people living in the countryside.

50
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
Let's see if they can do it, right?

51
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:57,960
That's right.

52
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,000
All right, but before we talk about that, why don't we take a look at four keywords in Language Takeaway.

53
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,280
Language Takeaway.

54
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,659
The first word is the name of an animal.

55
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,199
So you've all heard of cows, but have you heard of goats?

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,000
A goat.

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,740
A goat.

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,900
All right, so a goat is a strange-looking animal.

59
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,219
It's kind of skinny, and what do you get from a goat?

60
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,939
You can actually drink goat's milk, and many people like to eat goat's cheese, which is cheese made from goat's milk.

61
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,680
Okay, so a goat.

62
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:42,039
And we heard the sound that a goat makes, so I think it's pretty clear what a goat is, and they're very common, as we say, in farms, such as sheep and horses, cows, et cetera.

63
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,120
That's right, and normally when they're in the wild, they like to live in rocky places, like mountains.

64
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,520
Right, that's why they say they're very good climbers, because they don't fall off the mountains.

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,639
All right, and well, if you have cows, then they're probably going to be grazing.

66
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:00,680
Okay, so to graze is a verb.

67
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:01,719
It's something we do.

68
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,199
Well, we people don't do it.

69
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,280
Animals do it.

70
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,439
It's a way for us to describe how animals, like cows, eat.

71
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,879
It means to eat grass.

72
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,879
Okay, so if your cows or horses are grazing, that means they're eating grass somewhere out.

73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,339
That's right, they're walking, they stop, they eat some grass, they walk, they stop again.

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,339
It's a very slow process.

75
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:35,240
All right, so cows are usually grazing out in the countryside, and well, once they finish grazing and they get all fat, then in the mornings you have to milk them.

76
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,939
Okay, so we drink milk.

77
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:42,000
Milk is a thing, but it's also a verb, so to milk something.

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,879
All right, and if you milk a cow is when you extract the milk, the liquid, from them, right?

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,379
That's right.

80
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:57,699
All right, so underneath a cow there's an udder, or underneath a cow there are udders, which you have to squeeze with your hands to make the milk come out.

81
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,240
Okay, interesting word as well, udder, right?

82
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,199
It's like that big bag full of milk.

83
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,519
Exactly, so to milk a cow.

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:11,600
All right, and you have cows out in the fields grazing, and probably your horses and donkeys are going to be in the stable.

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:20,160
The stable is a place, okay, so this is something that's often found on farms, where the horses or the cows live.

86
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,420
It's a structure, it's a building for those animals.

87
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:34,620
Okay, so they're probably separated in different little rooms or compartments, and that's called a stable, so as you say, you usually find horses and cows and donkeys in there.

88
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,060
That's right, so a stable is a way to protect animals from the weather.

89
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,060
All right, very good, so four key words there, as we just saw.

90
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,779
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be back soon.

91
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,500
What was that?

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

93
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:17,720
Relax.

94
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,560
Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

95
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,879
You know what, I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

96
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,180
I'm going back to the city.

97
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,339
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

98
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:36,720
Fluency Builder.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,639
You know, Marco, I have to confess, I love Fluency Builder.

100
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:46,759
All right, and that's our first phrase for today, I have to confess.

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,379
Okay, so to confess is to tell someone something that's a secret.

102
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,040
Okay, so we can confess with a priest.

103
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,300
So we can confess to a priest, we can confess a secret to a friend.

104
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:04,399
But I have to confess is a very common phrase, it's a way for us to start a sentence.

105
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:05,839
I have to confess.

106
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,819
Right, so you're saying I have to be honest with you, I have to tell you the truth.

107
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,879
Exactly, so I have to confess, I'm not a huge fan of that sweater.

108
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:15,699
Okay.

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,540
So I have to be honest, I really don't like your sweater.

110
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,379
This is a way for us to be more polite when we're saying something that's negative.

111
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,139
Right, and in this case it was the girl who was confessing, and what she confessed is her second key phrase.

112
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,199
I don't know the first thing about farming.

113
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:40,100
Okay, so I don't know anything about farming is another way we could say this, or I don't know a thing about farming.

114
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,019
But I don't know the first thing about farming means I don't even understand what a farm is.

115
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,060
Okay, the first thing is what is a farm?

116
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,120
I don't even understand what a farm is for.

117
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,660
This is a way for us to say I don't know anything at all about this.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,180
And if we change the noun, right, and we can say, for example, I don't know the first thing about cars.

119
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,399
So I have no idea what models they are or what type of engine they have.

120
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,839
I don't know the first thing about cars.

121
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,439
All I know is how to turn them on.

122
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Or I don't know the first thing about wines.

123
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:15,459
I'd love to learn about wine, but I don't know the first thing about it.

124
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,819
Okay, so it's a phrase that you can use with many, many different nouns, right?

125
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,620
I don't know the first thing about architecture.

126
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,660
I don't know the first thing about English.

127
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,899
Right, well, we do, and that's why we're here to help you.

128
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,259
But this is a really great phrase to describe not understanding anything at all about something.

129
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:32,879
Right.

130
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,159
So this is a really great way to describe not knowing anything at all about something.

131
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,259
Okay, and well, obviously, since she didn't know the first thing about farming, she ended up leaving.

132
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,960
And she said, you know what, I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,860
Okay, so I can hack it, he can't hack it.

134
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,480
We use this with the verb to be able to, and it means I don't think I can do this.

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,259
I think this is too hard.

136
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:08,399
Or maybe if somebody quit, right, after a week at the office, and you can say he couldn't hack it.

137
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,299
He couldn't hack the pressure, and he left.

138
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,220
Exactly, so that means to handle, or to be able to handle, or to withstand.

139
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,559
So I just don't think I can hack the cold, right?

140
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,659
I can't handle the cold.

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,379
It's too cold here.

142
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,740
I'm moving somewhere warm.

143
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
All right, so I'm sure you guys will be able to hack our dialogue one last time.

144
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,399
So let's listen to it, and we'll be back.

145
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,759
Isn't this great?

146
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,700
I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food.

147
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,779
This is very beautiful, though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming.

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,419
That's fine, don't worry about it.

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,440
What was that?

150
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,299
Relax, it was just a goat.

151
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,639
And that?

152
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,639
It's just the cows that are grazing over there.

153
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,000
We can milk them later.

154
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,879
What was that?

155
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,419
Honey, seriously, it's just a sheep.

156
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,179
Relax.

157
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,919
Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable.

158
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,019
You know what?

159
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,259
I don't think I can hack it out here in the countryside.

160
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,539
I'm going back to the city.

161
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,759
All right, we're back.

162
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,000
So as you said, you're a fan of the countryside and about farming, right?

163
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:32,820
That's right.

164
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,299
Well, I wish I knew more about farming.

165
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,539
I don't know the first thing about milking a cow.

166
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,279
But I do come from a part of the world in Illinois, near Chicago, where we have a lot of farms.

167
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:54,000
And I appreciate the quiet and having animals around and being able to go on long walks without cars and horns and bicycles.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,220
It is actually a little bit refreshing to be out in the countryside sometimes and not even have internet or cell phone coverage or anything.

169
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,519
So it's just basically, you can't do anything else but relax, read a book, talk to people.

170
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:20,039
Now an interesting thing about this is a lot of people take for granted the countryside because I've met many people who live in the city, who grew up in the city and have never seen, for example, a live chicken.

171
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,659
And when they see it, they just freak out and take pictures with the chicken or a cow or something.

172
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,720
It's amazing.

173
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:28,159
That's really funny.

174
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:36,679
Well, I think there are very valuable skills that you learn being out in the countryside, like how to cook for yourself.

175
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,179
There's no one else who can cook for you or how to get food from animals.

176
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:46,179
Or maybe you can't even use a microwave, so how do you cook without a microwave or something?

177
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:46,620
That's right.

178
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,940
And I think the biggest problem for city people when they come to the countryside is that it's dirtier.

179
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:58,940
You get mud and there are bugs and I imagine some of our co-workers here having a very hard time in the countryside.

180
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,860
Yes, indeed.

181
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,539
