00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we're talking about things at the office.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right, we are at the office but this time we are going to ask our boss or manager for a raise.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alright, so what is this word raise?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's take a look at it in today's vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Alright, so we're going to ask for a raise.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So if you are at your office and you talk to your boss and you say, I want a raise, what does that mean?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That means I want more money.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, so I want a raise or increase in my salary.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right, so a raise is a thing that you ask for and in this case a raise means that you already work at the company, you already have a salary and you want some more money each month.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, so that's what we're going to be talking about today.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's listen to this dialogue.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Excuse me sir, may I talk to you?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Bill, sure, come on in.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What can I do for you?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I won't beat around the bush.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sir, I would like a raise.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A raise?

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Son, I would love to give you a raise but this is just not the right time.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I understand your position and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales but you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How does that sound?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Great, it's a deal.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you sir.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, the electric company, the gas company and the water company.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, we're back.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So now, why don't we take a look at Language Takeaway.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So the conversation we just heard is a conversation between a manager or a boss and the employee and the employee says, listen, I need to talk to you about something.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I have been an employee at this prestigious firm for over 10 years.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So prestigious is our first word.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, prestigious is an adjective, right?

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And it means very respected, very well known.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Esteemed, that's right.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So something that is prestigious has a good reputation.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Like for example, some universities, like you hear all the time about American universities like Harvard or Yale, which are considered to be prestigious universities.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Or the Nobel Peace Prize is a very prestigious award.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, so it's an adjective to describe something that's respectable, well known or esteemed, as you said.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Exactly.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, and what's our next word?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Our next one is not so happy.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is what we've been experiencing in the global economy this last year or two.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's called an economic downturn.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right, so an economic downturn is something negative, as you said.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So it means that the economy is not doing very well.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right, so economy, economic, you know what this means.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But in this case, downturn is the key part of this phrase, to slow down or to decrease.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So a downturn is a time when less people are making money and less money overall is being earned.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, so an economic downturn.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Very good.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why don't we move on to our next word, which is negative impact.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So the thing working here is the economic downturn, and it has had a negative impact on our sales, on this company's sales.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So a negative impact, as you know from the first word, is not a good thing.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Right, it's an effect, right?

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
An effect, but that's negative, so it's not a good effect.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So I could say that Marco, being late has had a negative impact on your work lately.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, or the opposite now.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What if something is a good effect on something?

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So Marco, your hard work has had a really positive impact on this company lately.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right, good.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So you can use a negative impact or a positive impact.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All right.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right, so impact again is just the effect that something has on something else.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And well, the boss said that he agrees to give him a raise because in part he didn't want to start a brain drain.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What's that?

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, this is a very common phrase you hear about countries.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They have a brain drain or they want to avoid a brain drain.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A drain is the part of a sink or a bathtub where the water goes down.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It goes away.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And so brain drain means all the brains or intelligent people or educated people leave a country and go to another country, or in this case, leave a company and go to another company.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So for example, if all the employees at Apple, maybe they start to quit or they start to move jobs and start to work for maybe Microsoft or Google, that's a brain drain, right?

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right because you're talking about a large number of people.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Maybe they're all unhappy because they say that working at Apple is not very nice.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So they all leave and go to this other company.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The same is true with countries.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can have very, very well educated people who when they stop studying, they want jobs, they all look somewhere else.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They go to America or Mexico or England.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

88
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And so that's called a brain drain because they all go away.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So five great phrases right there and words for you.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back to take a look at Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Excuse me, sir.

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
May I talk to you?

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Bill.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sure.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Come on in.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What can I do for you?

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over 10 years.

99
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I would like a raise.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first.

102
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
A raise?

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I understand your position and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales, but you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How does that sound?

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Great.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a deal.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you, sir.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, the electric company, the gas company and the water company.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This first phrase in today's fluency builder is one of my favorites.

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's something that we say often when we're having a conversation and we want the other person to just tell us what they're talking about.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
All right, so the guy said, you know what?

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Or you could also say, please don't beat around the bush.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So I'm not sure where this phrase comes from, but it means please be direct or I'm going to be direct.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I will not wait any longer to tell you what I'm talking about.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So if somebody is beating around the bush, that means they are not being direct.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They're not telling you something immediately.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's, you know, like when a person is trying to think, but you know, has a hard time and they're really trying to explain something.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But, you know, it's just, well, you know what I'm talking about.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's like that time with that thing where he did that.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is really annoying.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I know it's called beating around the bush because you just don't say what you're thinking.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Right, exactly.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So you don't say something directly.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Now, our next phrase is to take into consideration.

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Take something into consideration.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, this is something that the young man brings up when he's asking for a raise.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He says, you should take into consideration all of these great things I do.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This means when you make your decision, I want you to think about these things.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So consideration means you're thinking when you're trying to make a decision.

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
To consider.

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All right.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So to take something into consideration or you can just say to consider.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So I'm interested in buying a new TV, but I have to take into consideration the fact that I don't have a lot of money.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That means I probably won't get a new TV.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to think about these things when I'm making my decision.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, very good.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And our last phrase for today.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Towards the end, the boss was a little bit interested in knowing what happened or which companies were interested in him.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So he said just out of curiosity.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So this is something we say when we don't need to know something.

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It means that we would like to know because we're curious, we're interested, but not because I need to know right away what companies offer you jobs.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So this is a polite way to ask why someone did something.

149
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So, for example, so just out of curiosity, Marco, what kind of shampoo do you use?

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That is very interesting knowledge that you want there.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, obviously, I don't need to know what kind of shampoo Marco uses, but I'm curious because maybe I'm going to buy a new kind of shampoo.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you can start your sentence by using this phrase, just out of curiosity.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Just out of curiosity.

154
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a great one.

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Listen for that again as we listen to today's dialogue one more time, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about getting raised.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Excuse me, sir.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
May I talk to you?

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Bill, sure, come on in.

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What can I tell you to do for you?

160
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes?

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I won't beat around the bush.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sir, I would like a raise.

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I currently have three companies after me, and so I decided to talk to you first.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A raise?

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

167
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I understand your position, and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales, but you must also take into consideration my hard work, pro-activeness, and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How does that sound?

170
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Great.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a deal.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Thank you, sir.

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

174
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh, the electric company, the gas company, and the water company.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
All right, we're back.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Interesting enough, he needed a raise not because three companies wanted to hire him, but because he needed to pay his bills.

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, this is funny because he's not talking about companies, that's right, who are offering him jobs.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He's talking about the gas, the water, the electrical company.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's a very funny dialogue, but I think asking for a raise is very hard to do because you know that your boss is worried about money or it's a bad time to ask, but you want to ask because it's important that you get the right compensation for you.

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right, and actually it's important to have a clear objective when you want to ask for a raise, so more or less what you want to earn, but plausible within the company, so you're not going to ask for a 100% raise, right?

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can maybe aim for a 5 or 10% and most likely you'll get it if you negotiate properly.

182
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's right, and sometimes a raise isn't just about money.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can also, like he did, ask for some time off, so he gets some vacation days or perhaps some training.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Or bonuses.

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Or a bonus, so this all depends on the kind of negotiations that you make, but it's worth it to ask, so please let us know if you've ever had a good time or a bad time asking for a raise.

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It can be a very nerve-wracking experience.

187
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I know personally I'm very uncomfortable with it, but we're excited to hear what you have to say, and if you have any questions or comments, leave them for us on our website, EnglishPod.com.

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Bye, everyone.
