00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Excuse me, sir.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,940
May I talk to you?

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,439
Bill!

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,800
Sure, come on in.

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:10,919
What can I do for you?

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:17,179
Well, sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years.

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,019
Yes?

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,980
I won't beat around the bush.

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,879
Sir, I would like a raise.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,000
I currently have three companies after me, and so I decided to talk to you first.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,059
A raise?

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,259
Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,060
I understand your position, and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales.

14
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:44,899
But you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness, and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

15
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:54,539
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,420
How does that sound?

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,119
Great!

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,939
It's a deal.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,960
Thank you, sir.

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,579
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,400
Oh, the electric company, the gas company, and the water company.
