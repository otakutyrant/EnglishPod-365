00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Excuse me, sir.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
May I talk to you?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Bill!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Sure, come on in.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What can I do for you?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, sir, as you know, I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I won't beat around the bush.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sir, I would like a raise.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I currently have three companies after me, and so I decided to talk to you first.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A raise?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Son, I would love to give you a raise, but this is just not the right time.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I understand your position, and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But you must also take into consideration my hard work, proactiveness, and loyalty to this company for over a decade.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Taking into account these factors and considering I don't want to start a brain drain, I'm willing to offer you a 10% raise and an extra five days of vacation time.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How does that sound?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Great!

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a deal.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you, sir.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Before you go, just out of curiosity, what companies were after you?

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, the electric company, the gas company, and the water company.
