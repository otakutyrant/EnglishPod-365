1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,259
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:11,599
My name is Catherine, and today Marco and I have an elementary-level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,539
That's right.

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:21,739
It's a new year, and so we have a lesson for you where we are going to make new decisions and have a new opportunity in the new year, right?

6
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:22,420
That's right.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,079
So the new year is the time to change parts of your life, maybe.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,219
So that's what we're going to talk about today.

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:34,719
Let's listen to this dialogue three times, and when we come back, we'll be talking about the words and phrases in the dialogue.

10
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,399
So what are you going to do?

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,140
Take up an art class or something?

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,540
Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.

13
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,879
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything.

14
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,939
It's just that I've been smoking since I was 16, and I think it's time to stop.

15
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,540
I'm with you on that one.

16
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,400
Anything else you're planning on doing?

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,799
One last thing.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,799
I've decided to come out of the closet.

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,219
It's about time.

20
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:30,680
All right, we're back, and so if you notice, the dialogue has actually a lot of really, really rich phrases in there.

21
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:37,819
So today, we're going to change the format a little bit, and we're going to do Fluency Builder in two different sections.

22
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,040
So starting out with the first one on Fluency Builder, part one.

23
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,340
Fluency Builder.

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,260
So the new year, we think about new things, changing things.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,200
We have a great phrase in English to describe starting fresh, starting anew.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,120
And we say, turn over a new leaf.

27
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:01,019
Okay, so you turn over a new leaf.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,000
So that means that you are going to maybe make a radical change, right?

29
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,180
Some completely new.

30
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:08,120
That's right.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:15,419
All right, so if you think about it, it's a new chapter in your life or a new adventure or something like that.

32
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:17,240
Maybe you're going to quit your job.

33
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:18,300
Turn over a new leaf.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,500
Start a new job.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,060
Okay, so you can say, I'm going to turn over a new leaf, or Sarah turned over a new leaf and quit smoking.

36
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,879
Let's turn over a new leaf and forget the past.

37
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,699
There we go.

38
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,800
All right, so to turn over a new leaf.

39
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,020
So just imagine that you have a leaf on the ground, and you turn it over, and it's nice and clean.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,580
All right, and talking about cleanliness, our second phrase is to wipe the slate clean.

41
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,139
Okay, when I think about this phrase, I think about a chalkboard, okay?

42
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:57,199
So a slate is like a chalkboard, and all of the things that you've done, good and bad, are on that chalkboard.

43
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,419
And to wipe the slate clean means to erase those words, erase those things.

44
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:07,039
So perhaps Marco and I fight all the time, and we're angry at each other.

45
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,680
Finally, I say, listen, Marco, let's wipe the slate clean.

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,060
Let's forget the past.

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,699
Let's forget the things we said and start again.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
And start a new leaf.

49
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,800
To wipe the slate clean is to just start over, you know, just to erase everything.

50
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,699
Let's forget about it and start over.

51
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:24,479
Exactly.

52
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:33,080
All right, and so we're starting over, and his friend is asking, you decided to wipe the slate clean, and the friend said, you got it.

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
You got what?

54
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:34,759
What?

55
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:35,219
It.

56
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,300
What is it?

57
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,520
In English, we love the word it.

58
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,060
Well, in this case, you got it means you're right exactly.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,259
You understand what I'm talking about.

60
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:50,259
Okay, so if you agree with me or I understand what you're talking about, you would say, you got it.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,919
You got it.

62
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:51,639
You got it.

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,879
All right, so I'm trying to explain to you maybe, Marco, something very difficult.

64
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,180
Like, you know, if you add 4 and 10, you get 14, but what if you add 10 more?

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,300
It's 24.

66
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,280
You got it.

67
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,659
All right.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
Okay, so he understands math.

69
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,699
Yes.

70
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,340
Okay, so that's the way you would use you got it.

71
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,020
It's a really popular phrase.

72
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:18,680
I mean, you can use it on pretty much anything, not only if you're right, but also if somebody agrees with it or you promise something, right?

73
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,300
So, are you going to pick me up today?

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,240
Yeah, you got it.

75
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:21,660
No problem.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,180
Okay, so it's a way to agree or to show that you're saying yes.

77
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,060
Yes, yes.

78
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:32,839
Okay, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll come back shortly to look at Fluency Builder Part 2.

79
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,319
Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

80
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:44,600
Yeah?

81
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,100
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean.

82
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
You got it.

83
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,060
I have a new job.

84
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,180
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

85
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,199
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,779
So, what are you going to do?

87
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,500
Take up an art class or something?

88
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,920
Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.

89
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,279
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything.

90
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,319
It's just that I've been smoking since I was 16, and I think it's time to stop.

91
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,939
I'm with you on that one.

92
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,779
Anything else you're planning on doing?

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,180
One last thing.

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,199
I've decided to come out of the closet.

95
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,639
It's about time.

96
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:26,100
All right, we're back, so now let's continue with our Fluency Builder.

97
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:35,120
Well, they kept talking, and the guy mentioned that he's going to stop smoking, but it's not because he is pinching pennies.

98
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,819
Oh, pinching.

99
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,500
That sounds painful.

100
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, pinching is something you do, especially when you're a child.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,399
You squeeze the skin, pinch, and it hurts.

102
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,720
So to pinch really is to hold something with two fingers.

103
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:55,279
To pinch pennies means to try to spend very, very, very little money, okay?

104
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,519
So if I say, hey, Marco, you want to go to dinner tonight?

105
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:02,139
There's this really nice Italian place.

106
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,720
It's a little expensive, but...

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,620
Oh, I can't.

108
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm really pinching pennies these days because I'm kind of broke.

110
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,360
So maybe we'll go somewhere cheaper.

111
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,180
Yeah, so actually pennies are one cent coins, right?

112
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,040
They're called pennies in the United States.

113
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:26,360
That's right, and it's the smallest kind of money that we have in America, so if you're pinching pennies, if you're saving pennies, it means you really don't have much money.

114
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,800
Right, you're really, really saving.

115
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:28,319
That's right.

116
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,139
Okay, so pinching pennies.

117
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,300
So he decided to quit smoking, and his friend agreed with him and said, you know what, I'm with you on that one.

118
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,240
Okay, so you quit smoking, Marco, and I quit smoking.

119
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,079
I'm with you on that one.

120
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,439
I think it's a good idea.

121
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,060
If I'm with you on that one, it means I agree with you.

122
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:47,379
You're doing the right thing.

123
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,399
So you can say, I'm with you on that one, or you can just say, you know what, I'm with you.

124
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:55,699
Do it, or I'm with you, I agree, or I'm with you, I support your decision.

125
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,420
So you are going to go skydiving in a couple weeks.

126
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,639
That means you're going to jump out of an airplane.

127
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,779
I'm not with you on that one.

128
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,480
You don't support my decision.

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,839
I think it's okay for you, but I would not want to do it personally.

130
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,699
Right, so you can do it in that way or just anything.

131
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:13,120
You support somebody's decision.

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,879
I'm with you.

133
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,839
I'm with you on that one.

134
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,480
Exactly.

135
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,019
All right, and our last phrase, to come out of the closet.

136
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,379
So who's in the closet?

137
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,040
Why is somebody hiding in the closet?

138
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,019
Okay, someone's not really hiding in the closet.

139
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:37,060
This is a phrase we use to describe someone who is gay or lesbian, who has a secret about being gay or lesbian.

140
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:44,660
So when they come out of the closet, they're telling their friends and family for the first time that this is how they feel.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,720
So it's basically a phrase that's kind of a metaphor to say, you know what, I'm going to tell everyone that I am gay or lesbian, right?

142
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:53,800
That's right.

143
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,980
Well, it's because in English oftentimes a closet is a place where we keep secrets, okay?

144
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,100
And so to come out of the closet means to share your secrets with people.

145
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,600
So sometimes in English you say you have skeletons in the closet.

146
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,060
That's right.

147
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,879
This is a little different.

148
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:13,060
Maybe I killed someone and it's a skeleton in my closet.

149
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,500
It's a secret that I keep.

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,399
But a skeleton in your closet can also be a very big secret, like you were once married and you never told anyone.

151
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,920
Yeah, or I have two kids and I never told you guys.

152
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:36,700
Right, so those are the skeletons in the closet, but in this case it's to come out of the closet, and that's always related to telling somebody for the first time that you are gay or lesbian.

153
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:44,139
That's right, and we don't say it about being straight, which is the opposite, which is men who love women and women who love men.

154
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,559
You don't say it about coming out of the closet there.

155
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,379
You say it about being gay or lesbian.

156
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,360
Okay, so very interesting.

157
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:56,120
And so I think we should listen to this dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

158
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,580
Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

159
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:08,840
Yeah?

160
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:11,320
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?

161
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,019
You got it.

162
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,320
I have a new job.

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,419
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

164
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,440
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

165
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,019
So what are you going to do?

166
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,779
Take up an art class or something?

167
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:27,159
Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.

168
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,519
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything.

169
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,580
It's just that I've been smoking since I was 16, and I think it's time to stop.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,159
I'm with you on that one.

171
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,039
Anything else you're planning on doing?

172
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,419
One last thing.

173
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,440
I've decided to come out of the closet.

174
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,919
It's about time.

175
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,519
Alright, we're back.

176
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:58,879
So this is very interesting, and these phrases are so common because if you have a fight with somebody, you say, you know what, let's just wipe the slate clean and start all over again, or let's turn over a new leaf.

177
00:09:59,059 --> 00:09:59,899
Let's stop fighting.

178
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,120
And especially in New Year's, right?

179
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:05,240
Everyone makes a promise to start fresh.

180
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,259
That's right.

181
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,879
Well, the new year, you can use a new calendar.

182
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,799
You can take a fresh perspective on your life.

183
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,100
It's refreshing, and I think it's good that we do this.

184
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,659
We evaluate the things that make us happy, and we evaluate the things that make us unhappy.

185
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,100
And part of that means turning over a new leaf.

186
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:28,500
Part of it also means apologizing to people, or trying to make the relationships in your life healthier.

187
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,539
And I think it's very healthy that the person in this dialogue says, listen, I'm finally going to come out of the closet.

188
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,720
I'm going to be honest with my friends and family.

189
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:54,159
And that's really interesting because, as we said, to come out of the closet is a phrase used in English and mostly related only in this context, so you might see it in TV shows or in a movie, but it's an interesting topic still debatable all over the world about gay marriages and things like that.

190
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,000
That's right.

191
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,000
So we're curious about your New Year's resolutions.

192
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,179
Are you going to be wiping any slates clean?

193
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,919
Are you going to be doing anything differently this year?

194
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,580
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

195
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,460
We look forward to hearing from you, and until next time.

196
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,059
Bye, everyone.

197
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,419
Bye.

198
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,559
