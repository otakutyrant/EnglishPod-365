00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:10,820
EnglishPod.com Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,060
Yeah?

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,580
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?

4
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,280
You got it.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,539
I have a new job.

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,660
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

8
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,260
So what are you going to do?

9
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:27,019
Take up an art class or something?

10
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,399
Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,219
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, it's just that I've been smoking since I was 16.

12
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,820
And I think it's time to stop.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,380
I'm with you on that one.

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,259
Anything else you're planning on doing?

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,640
One last thing.

16
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,679
I've decided to come out of the closet.

17
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,079
It's about time.
