00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Now that it's the new year, I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You finally decided to wipe the slate clean?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You got it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have a new job.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm living in a new city with new friends.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is my opportunity to make some small changes in the way I live my life.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So what are you going to do?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Take up an art class or something?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, first of all, I've decided to stop smoking.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's not that I'm pinching pennies or anything, it's just that I've been smoking since I was 16.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And I think it's time to stop.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm with you on that one.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Anything else you're planning on doing?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One last thing.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I've decided to come out of the closet.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's about time.
