00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary-level lesson about food, one of my favorite things to talk about.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We are going to talk about food, but specifically we're going to talk about a family barbecue.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is a family barbecue?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, I'll just say a few words first.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A barbecue is usually something that we do outside.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We bring food, we play games, maybe have some drinks, and a lot of the food is grilled.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So that's what we're talking about today.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to hear this dialogue first, and then we'll come back to talk about it.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yep.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The steaks and chicken are marinated, and I also bought hamburger buns.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good idea.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Great.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I asked Grace to bring cups and serve yetz, as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is going to be a great barbecue.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh no, it's raining.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All right, we're back.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So probably a couple of words you didn't really understand, so let's take a look at those now in Language Takeaway.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Lots of food words, Marco.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The first one is barbecue.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We were talking about that a minute ago.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A barbecue is something we do usually for something on a special occasion or for dinner.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's a summertime thing.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know, you go outside when it's warm, and the entire family comes and we have food.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Sometimes people even bring food.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And actually, as you mentioned, it's something that you do a barbecue.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You have a family barbecue, but it's also a verb.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
To barbecue something, so to cook meat on a barbecue.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So that's cooking meat, not in a stove, not with gas.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Usually it's under a fire or very warm, intense heat coming from coals.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Exactly.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And so before we cook food, usually before we cook meat on the grill, before we barbecue it, we have to marinate it, okay?

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So in this situation, the steaks and the chicken are already marinated.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, so to marinate something, which is a verb, or the steaks and chickens are marinated, which is an adjective, so basically means that you have added spices and maybe some lemon juice, different herbs or salts to the meats in order to give it flavor before you cook them.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Exactly, sometimes in Indian cooking, for example, you marinate with a yogurt sauce and you leave the meats in the refrigerator for a whole night.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So marinating or to marinate is a process to give flavor to food.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Very good.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All right, so we've marinated our food, our chicken, our steaks, but also we have hamburgers, so we need hamburger buns.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are buns?

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, buns are pieces of bread that are for special kinds of food.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So you have a hamburger bun, it's a round piece of bread, and the hamburger goes on one piece and under another piece.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A hot dog bun is different, it's like a piece of bread that's folded and the hot dog goes in the middle.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So bun is a special kind of bread for these kinds of foods.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All right, so remember, if you want to have a hot dog, you need to buy hot dog buns.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So people know already that you're talking about bread, and if you want to buy a hamburger bread, you say a hamburger bun.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right, so hamburger buns and hot dog buns.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But after we talk about having the hamburger buns, we discuss how many hot dogs are going to cook.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So the person says, we should cook a couple dozen hot dogs.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All right, so a dozen is 12 units of something.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right, so eggs are sold in dozens.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We buy a dozen eggs, we buy 12 eggs.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, or you can say half a dozen, that means six.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Half of 12.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And a couple dozen is usually around 24, 25.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, very good.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So a dozen hot dogs, and they are also getting kebabs.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are kebabs?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mmm, one of my favorite foods, kebabs are sticks or skewers of meat.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you have a very thin stick, and you put the meat on it, and you put that on the grill, and you cook the meat on the grill.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So yeah, those are very common, for example, in the Middle East, right?

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You have kebabs, sticks of meat, and also maybe some vegetables put on it, and you grill them.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Exactly, very flavorful, very tasty meat.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll come back shortly to look at some more words.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yep, the steaks and chicken are marinated, and I also bought hamburger buns.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah, good idea.

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Great!

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I asked Grace to bring cups and serviettes, as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is going to be a great barbecue!

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
All right, we're back, so now why don't we go to a second part of Language Takeaway and take a look at five more words.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, the first word that we're going to look at is lawn furniture, so we're going to have lawn furniture outside.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, so before we even start thinking about food, we have to decide where people will sit at this barbecue, and so we have to find out how much lawn furniture we have.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Furniture can be a sofa, a table, a chair, we have furniture in the house, but lawn furniture is furniture for the outside.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A lawn is the green grass outside your house.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it's usually not going to be made out of wood, for example, because if it rains, it might get ruined, right?

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So usually it's either plastic or maybe even rock or stone.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or metal.

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Or metal.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So that's what lawn furniture is.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Furniture that is made to be outside in your backyard, for example, or that sits on your lawn.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Exactly, and so we're going to be on the lawn furniture.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We have the special thing for cooking meat outside.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The grill.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, so we mentioned that you grill chicken or you grill steaks, but it's also a noun.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A grill.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So a grill, what is that?

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:01,000
A grill is like a stove for the outside, but instead of having electricity to make the fire, we have gas or propane, and this is something that we light on fire, and we use coals to keep the insides very warm.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And so this is just a way to cook meat or even vegetables outside.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, perfect.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So that is a grill.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And if you're going to cook foods or vegetables in this way, so you're going to grill them.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
All right.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And well, just in case it gets hot and you want to hide from the sun, we are going to set up a tent.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay, a tent.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can sleep in a tent, but in this case, a tent is just a covering outside, so maybe some cloth or some fabric that will stand over us when we sit down or want to be outside.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's also a way to protect us from the rain.

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right, so as you mentioned, a tent is something that you set up temporarily made out of cloth or plastic to protect you from the sun or rain, or if you're going camping, you sleep in one.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right, and now that they have all the food, they need cups, and then they mentioned this strange word that kind of sounds French, serviette.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Serviette.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes, so I do think it comes from the French word.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is a British way of saying napkins.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's like paper for cleaning your hands and cleaning your mouth that you throw away.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so you can say napkins, or if you want to sound a little bit more fancier, you can say serviettes.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And speaking of fancy, let's talk about beer.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Where do we keep beer?

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It has to stay cold, right?

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right, so usually you would place it in a refrigerator, but if you're outside or you're going camping, you want to keep them cold or you want to keep something hot, you place it in a cooler.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, so a cooler is a plastic bin or a plastic box that we put all of the ice in and the drinks, so it's not just for beer, it's also for Coke and Sprite and all these different drinks.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right, so it's usually made to keep something cool, but as I said, if you want to keep something warm, you can also keep it in the cooler.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It keeps the temperature of the foods.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And the nice thing is that it's not electric, so you can use it anywhere.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Alright, so that's all the words for today.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yep, the steaks and chicken are marinated, and I also bought hamburger buns.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kebabs.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, good idea.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Great!

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I asked Grace to bring cups and serve yetz, as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is going to be a great barbecue!

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh no, it's raining!

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's raining!

136
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Alright, we're back.

137
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, family barbecues and doing these things.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Did you do these when you were young, at home, do you still like to do it?

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All the time.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I love barbecues.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's one of my favorite ways to eat food.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The nice thing about a barbecue is you get to sit outside and relax, and there's nothing better than nice, fresh grilled meat.

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You have all your friends over, so you're having a couple of beers, and you're having some meat.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's actually a really nice way of just having something at home with good friends and family, right?

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Exactly, and some of the most important barbecues we have are in the summer near July 4th.

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:31,000
People like to have July 4th barbecues where you celebrate Independence Day and sit outside and drink and have hot dogs and hamburgers and macaroni and cheese.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Actually, while I was in Chile, I noticed that as well.

149
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Near their festivities for their independence, which is September 18th, a lot of people get together and have barbecues, and it's so, so popular that pretty much every house in the neighborhood you can smell somebody barbecuing on the weekend.

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're making me so hungry!

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Alright guys, so if you have any questions, any doubts, or if it's common for you guys to barbecue back home, then why don't you send us a couple of comments at EnglishPod.com, and we'll see everyone there.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Bye!

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Bye!

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Bye!
