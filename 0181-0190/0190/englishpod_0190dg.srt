EnglishPod.com Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

2
00:00:09,539 --> 00:00:13,099
Yep, the steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,359
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kabobs.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,640
Yeah, good idea.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,539
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,460
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,379
Great!

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,899
I asked Grace to bring cups and serve yetz as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,960
This is going to be a great barbecue!

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,079
Oh no, it's raining!
