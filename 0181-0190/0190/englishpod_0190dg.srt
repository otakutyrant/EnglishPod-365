EnglishPod.com Is everything ready for the big family barbecue tomorrow?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yep, the steaks and chicken are marinated and I also bought hamburger buns.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We should also cook a couple dozen hot dogs and kabobs.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, good idea.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We could put some lawn furniture outside next to the grill.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I also set up the tent outside so we can hide from the sun if it gets too hot.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Great!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I asked Grace to bring cups and serve yetz as she is also bringing two big coolers for the beers.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is going to be a great barbecue!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh no, it's raining!
