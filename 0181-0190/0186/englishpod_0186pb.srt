00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:05,219
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,140
My name is Catherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson for all of you.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,839
That's right.

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:18,600
We're going to be talking business on this occasion on EnglishPod, but specifically about planning a business.

6
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:19,519
Right.

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,320
So before a business opens, a lot of planning has to happen.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,280
That means people will decide what kind of a product they want to sell, what kind of a market they want to sell to, et cetera.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,359
So that is the focus of today's lesson.

10
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:37,719
Let's take a listen to the dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

11
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,780
I've had it.

12
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:50,659
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,799
So what are you going to do, just quit?

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,219
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,579
I've decided to create my own company.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors, and start working for myself.

17
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,599
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,959
Well, no.

19
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,420
It can't be that hard.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,140
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how are you going to do things, and that's it, right?

21
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,879
You couldn't be more wrong.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,780
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less.

23
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:27,140
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, et cetera.

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,799
Well, that seems easy enough.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,819
Wait, there's more.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,439
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're different from competitors.

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,400
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

28
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,680
You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,959
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,700
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

31
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,439
Jeez, is that all?

32
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,260
Almost.

33
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,840
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,360
Here, you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits.

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,500
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

36
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,860
I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.

37
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,500
All right, we're back.

38
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:33,180
The guy wanted to open up a business, but his friend explained that it's not so easy and gave a lot of interesting words and phrases there.

39
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:33,960
He did.

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,199
He seemed a little naive.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,439
He didn't really know how much work is involved in opening a business.

42
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,419
Exactly.

43
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,879
I think we should take a look at some of the words used on language takeaway.

44
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,740
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,800
The first word is the heart and soul of the process before you open a business.

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,300
It's the business plan.

47
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,400
All right, so the business plan.

48
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,800
As you said, it's a noun and it's basically a document that explains what's going on in the business.

49
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:05,520
Exactly.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,139
It's a paper that you write about the business that you want to open and it's a plan.

51
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,620
So that's what the name says.

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,479
You have to tell what you will do, how much money you will spend, how much money you will need.

53
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:26,060
Because if you're asking people for money, they want to know where the money will be spent if it's going to be spent on wise decisions.

54
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:26,979
Exactly.

55
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,180
And as you mentioned, so you show this business plan maybe to a bank, but also maybe to an investor.

56
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,180
That's right.

57
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,599
So investor is our next word.

58
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,939
It's another noun, but this noun is a person.

59
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,360
A person is an investor.

60
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,000
If he or she gives money to someone else and expects more money to come back.

61
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,139
So a person that's starting out a business maybe has enough money himself to open up a business, but sometimes you need extra money.

62
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:57,620
So you look for investors, people who are interested in giving you money.

63
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,199
For example, I have a cupcake company.

64
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,240
I want to sell cupcakes to people and I need $1,000.

65
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:05,979
So Marco, do you want to be an investor?

66
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you want to invest some money?

67
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,099
Yes, for sure.

68
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:10,400
A cupcake company, that sounds great.

69
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,879
I know, but what happens if I don't sell cupcakes?

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,819
That's a problem for you because you have made a risky investment.

71
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,680
That's right.

72
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,019
So that's what happens with investors.

73
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:29,939
But now if you want to attract the attention of your investors with your business plan, I think part of the most important aspects of this plan is the executive summary.

74
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,319
A summary is usually an outline of the important points of a paper or a document.

75
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:46,699
So in this case, I could say, Catherine's Cupcake Company will sell delicious cupcakes of 10 different flavors to the market of 5-year-olds to 55-year-olds.

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,939
People will love them.

77
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,279
She has a great secret recipe and she plans to triple her investments by next year.

78
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,759
That's exactly it.

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:03,699
So if an investor reads the executive summary, which shouldn't be more than two pages long, you can pretty much get the idea of what the business is about.

80
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,879
So if you want more details, you have to read the rest of the business plan, but mainly with the executive summary, you can more or less know what it's all about.

81
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,620
So a summary, like I said, is something that should be short and it should give you all of the most important information about something.

82
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:19,279
Exactly.

83
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:29,639
And while they were talking more in depth about analyzing things and doing some research, and among those things, the girl mentioned the socioeconomic factors.

84
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:42,060
When I said we're going to sell cupcakes for my company to people between the ages of 5 and 55, we need to analyze, we need to look at their socioeconomic factors.

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,620
Socio comes from the word social, it means where in society they are, they're upper class, middle class, or lower class.

86
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,060
Economic means how much money do they make?

87
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,379
Do they make $10,000 a year or $100,000 a year?

88
00:05:54,379 --> 00:06:03,339
And so the kind of people we want to sell my cupcakes to will change according to their socioeconomic factors.

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,060
That's right.

90
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,920
So as you mentioned, socio comes from the word social or from society, so you're analyzing these factors from society.

91
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,319
And well, part of these factors is the GDP per capita.

92
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,420
So we have two different words there, an acronym, GDP.

93
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,360
GDP, gross domestic products.

94
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:35,480
That might seem confusing because gross means different things at different times, but in this case, domestic means our country, so within a country, all of the products add it up together.

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,120
And gross is basically that, just all the products added up together without taking into consideration any other things.

96
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:48,360
So the GDP is basically all the goods and services produced in a country within a given time.

97
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,500
And what about per capita though?

98
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:58,579
So per capita comes from Latin, per means four or each, and capita is a head, so this is per person.

99
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:06,519
So GDP per capita means how much, how many goods and services are made divided by the number of people in that place.

100
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:07,740
Exactly.

101
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:15,220
So you probably have these indicators in your country or your own language as well, but that's basically it.

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,000
And the acronym is gross domestic product.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:29,899
And just to explain a little bit, if you see this in Wikipedia or in an encyclopedia, normally a very low GDP per capita is $500, American dollars, and a high one would be $35,000.

104
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:30,740
$35,000, yeah.

105
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,300
And that's usually per year, right?

106
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,959
Because that's usually how it's taken into consideration.

107
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,240
The time is a year.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,740
All right, so those are the words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,779
Now why don't we move on to a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

110
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,279
Fluency Builder.

111
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,060
Okay, so this important first phrase, Marco, has to do with our last first phrase.

112
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,399
We had a business plan.

113
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,019
So what do you do?

114
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,759
You write up a business plan.

115
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,579
And that's a common way of saying to write or to create, to work on a business plan, to write up.

116
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:06,220
Right.

117
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:11,480
So it's something that we say that's very colloquial, something that is very spoken.

118
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:17,279
And I can't explain why we say it, but you'll sound very fluent if you say, I'm going to write up a business plan.

119
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,060
Why don't you write up a business plan?

120
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:24,939
Right, so it would be correct to say, I'm going to write a business plan, or I have to write a business plan.

121
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,360
But if you use this phrase, I'm going to write up a business plan, it's more fluent, right?

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
It's just more native-like.

123
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,600
All right, and our next phrase is a return on investment.

124
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:39,299
Okay, so earlier we talked about investors.

125
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,399
The money that they invest is called an investment.

126
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,539
Okay, these words are all very closely related.

127
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:58,580
And when Marco decided to give money to my cupcake business, he expects the money to come back, and he expects more, actually, to come back than what he put in.

128
00:08:58,659 --> 00:09:02,179
So that's called a return on investment, the money that's the difference.

129
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:07,600
So if he gives me $1,000 and I give him back $1,500 in a year, he made $500.

130
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,539
That's amazing.

131
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,620
That means it's a good return on his investment.

132
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,879
So that's the term that we use, a return on investment.

133
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:19,860
So you don't say to return on investment, you see a return on investment.

134
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:23,879
Exactly, it's a thing, it's a number, it's a quantity, it's something you can count.

135
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,580
Right.

136
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:34,340
And well, in the end, after seeing that this business plan is not so easy, the guy said, you know what, I'm not going to quit my job and just save myself the hassle.

137
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:35,659
What's the hassle?

138
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,000
The hassle, that's an interesting word.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,539
So if I'm going to save myself the hassle, the hassle is like the problem or the hard work that it involves.

140
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:46,879
It's a lot of trouble.

141
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:47,779
A lot of trouble.

142
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:55,539
So I was going to cook some dinner tonight, but I'm going to save myself the hassle of going to the grocery store and buying it and cooking it by just ordering food.

143
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:56,059
Right.

144
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,360
So that's a good example.

145
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:03,759
Instead of doing all the work of cooking, you just save yourself the hassle, pick up the phone, and get food delivered to your house.

146
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,120
Right.

147
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,460
And the word we change here, you can say save myself, save yourself, save his self.

148
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,340
So you change that pronoun.

149
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:10,899
The pronoun.

150
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,480
Exactly.

151
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,659
So you can save yourself the hassle or I'm just going to save myself the hassle.

152
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,340
Okay.

153
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,519
So that's about it for Fluency Builder.

154
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,059
Let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and we'll be back in a minute to talk about business.

155
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,639
I've had it.

156
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,460
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

157
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,860
So what are you going to do?

158
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,559
Just quit?

159
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,039
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

160
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,419
I've decided to create my own company.

161
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,779
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors, and start working for myself.

162
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:50,419
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

163
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,779
Well, no.

164
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,259
It can't be that hard.

165
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,940
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how are you going to do things, and that's it, right?

166
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,720
You couldn't be more wrong.

167
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,620
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less.

168
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,919
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, et cetera.

169
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,600
Well, that seems easy enough.

170
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,659
Wait, there's more.

171
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,259
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're different from competitors.

172
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,220
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

173
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,519
You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables.

174
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,779
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has.

175
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:43,580
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

176
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,259
Jeez, is that all?

177
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,080
Almost.

178
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,659
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

179
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,159
Here, you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow, and profits.

180
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,340
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

181
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,740
Umm, I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.

182
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,860
So it was pretty interesting that he wanted to quit his job and just, you know, set up a business, but actually, many people say that business plans are unnecessary.

183
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,700
Really?

184
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,840
Do these people have lots of money and they don't need investors?

185
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:35,340
I think the problem is that there are many books out there that give you clear examples of companies, Fortune 500 companies, that started out without a business plan.

186
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:44,159
So I think many people take this as a rule, like, well, they didn't need one or it's not really necessary or why should I write up a business plan?

187
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:53,480
Well, I'm not an entrepreneur and I'm not a business person, but my feeling is that a business plan is as much for investors as it is for yourself.

188
00:12:54,059 --> 00:13:10,799
It helps you clarify your goals, it helps you explain your objectives to your future colleagues, and I think it's just a really good way to map out the first year of a business because it tends to, a lot of businesses fail in that first year, so I think this is a really important step.

189
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,740
Yeah, exactly.

190
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:22,120
