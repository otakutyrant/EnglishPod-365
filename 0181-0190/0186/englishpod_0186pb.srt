00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson for all of you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're going to be talking business on this occasion on EnglishPod, but specifically about planning a business.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Right.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So before a business opens, a lot of planning has to happen.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That means people will decide what kind of a product they want to sell, what kind of a market they want to sell to, et cetera.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So that is the focus of today's lesson.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's take a listen to the dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a minute to talk about what's going on.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've had it.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So what are you going to do, just quit?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've decided to create my own company.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors, and start working for myself.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, no.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It can't be that hard.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how are you going to do things, and that's it, right?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You couldn't be more wrong.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, et cetera.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, that seems easy enough.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wait, there's more.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're different from competitors.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jeez, is that all?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Almost.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here, you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right, we're back.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The guy wanted to open up a business, but his friend explained that it's not so easy and gave a lot of interesting words and phrases there.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He did.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He seemed a little naive.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He didn't really know how much work is involved in opening a business.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Exactly.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think we should take a look at some of the words used on language takeaway.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Language takeaway.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The first word is the heart and soul of the process before you open a business.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's the business plan.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All right, so the business plan.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
As you said, it's a noun and it's basically a document that explains what's going on in the business.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Exactly.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's a paper that you write about the business that you want to open and it's a plan.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So that's what the name says.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You have to tell what you will do, how much money you will spend, how much money you will need.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Because if you're asking people for money, they want to know where the money will be spent if it's going to be spent on wise decisions.

54
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Exactly.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And as you mentioned, so you show this business plan maybe to a bank, but also maybe to an investor.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So investor is our next word.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's another noun, but this noun is a person.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
A person is an investor.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
If he or she gives money to someone else and expects more money to come back.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So a person that's starting out a business maybe has enough money himself to open up a business, but sometimes you need extra money.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So you look for investors, people who are interested in giving you money.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
For example, I have a cupcake company.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I want to sell cupcakes to people and I need $1,000.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So Marco, do you want to be an investor?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you want to invest some money?

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, for sure.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
A cupcake company, that sounds great.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I know, but what happens if I don't sell cupcakes?

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's a problem for you because you have made a risky investment.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's right.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that's what happens with investors.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But now if you want to attract the attention of your investors with your business plan, I think part of the most important aspects of this plan is the executive summary.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A summary is usually an outline of the important points of a paper or a document.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So in this case, I could say, Catherine's Cupcake Company will sell delicious cupcakes of 10 different flavors to the market of 5-year-olds to 55-year-olds.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
People will love them.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She has a great secret recipe and she plans to triple her investments by next year.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's exactly it.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So if an investor reads the executive summary, which shouldn't be more than two pages long, you can pretty much get the idea of what the business is about.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So if you want more details, you have to read the rest of the business plan, but mainly with the executive summary, you can more or less know what it's all about.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So a summary, like I said, is something that should be short and it should give you all of the most important information about something.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Exactly.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And while they were talking more in depth about analyzing things and doing some research, and among those things, the girl mentioned the socioeconomic factors.

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When I said we're going to sell cupcakes for my company to people between the ages of 5 and 55, we need to analyze, we need to look at their socioeconomic factors.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Socio comes from the word social, it means where in society they are, they're upper class, middle class, or lower class.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Economic means how much money do they make?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do they make $10,000 a year or $100,000 a year?

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so the kind of people we want to sell my cupcakes to will change according to their socioeconomic factors.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's right.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So as you mentioned, socio comes from the word social or from society, so you're analyzing these factors from society.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And well, part of these factors is the GDP per capita.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So we have two different words there, an acronym, GDP.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
GDP, gross domestic products.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That might seem confusing because gross means different things at different times, but in this case, domestic means our country, so within a country, all of the products add it up together.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And gross is basically that, just all the products added up together without taking into consideration any other things.

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So the GDP is basically all the goods and services produced in a country within a given time.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And what about per capita though?

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So per capita comes from Latin, per means four or each, and capita is a head, so this is per person.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So GDP per capita means how much, how many goods and services are made divided by the number of people in that place.

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Exactly.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So you probably have these indicators in your country or your own language as well, but that's basically it.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And the acronym is gross domestic product.

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And just to explain a little bit, if you see this in Wikipedia or in an encyclopedia, normally a very low GDP per capita is $500, American dollars, and a high one would be $35,000.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
$35,000, yeah.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And that's usually per year, right?

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because that's usually how it's taken into consideration.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The time is a year.

108
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right, so those are the words that we have for you on Language Takeaway.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Now why don't we move on to a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Fluency Builder.

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay, so this important first phrase, Marco, has to do with our last first phrase.

112
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We had a business plan.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So what do you do?

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You write up a business plan.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And that's a common way of saying to write or to create, to work on a business plan, to write up.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So it's something that we say that's very colloquial, something that is very spoken.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And I can't explain why we say it, but you'll sound very fluent if you say, I'm going to write up a business plan.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why don't you write up a business plan?

120
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right, so it would be correct to say, I'm going to write a business plan, or I have to write a business plan.

121
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But if you use this phrase, I'm going to write up a business plan, it's more fluent, right?

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's just more native-like.

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All right, and our next phrase is a return on investment.

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Okay, so earlier we talked about investors.

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The money that they invest is called an investment.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, these words are all very closely related.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And when Marco decided to give money to my cupcake business, he expects the money to come back, and he expects more, actually, to come back than what he put in.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So that's called a return on investment, the money that's the difference.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So if he gives me $1,000 and I give him back $1,500 in a year, he made $500.

130
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's amazing.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That means it's a good return on his investment.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So that's the term that we use, a return on investment.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So you don't say to return on investment, you see a return on investment.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Exactly, it's a thing, it's a number, it's a quantity, it's something you can count.

135
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right.

136
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And well, in the end, after seeing that this business plan is not so easy, the guy said, you know what, I'm not going to quit my job and just save myself the hassle.

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's the hassle?

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The hassle, that's an interesting word.

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So if I'm going to save myself the hassle, the hassle is like the problem or the hard work that it involves.

140
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a lot of trouble.

141
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
A lot of trouble.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So I was going to cook some dinner tonight, but I'm going to save myself the hassle of going to the grocery store and buying it and cooking it by just ordering food.

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Right.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So that's a good example.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Instead of doing all the work of cooking, you just save yourself the hassle, pick up the phone, and get food delivered to your house.

146
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Right.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And the word we change here, you can say save myself, save yourself, save his self.

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you change that pronoun.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The pronoun.

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Exactly.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So you can save yourself the hassle or I'm just going to save myself the hassle.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So that's about it for Fluency Builder.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's listen to today's dialogue one more time and we'll be back in a minute to talk about business.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've had it.

156
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So what are you going to do?

158
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just quit?

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I've decided to create my own company.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors, and start working for myself.

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, no.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It can't be that hard.

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how are you going to do things, and that's it, right?

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You couldn't be more wrong.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, et cetera.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, that seems easy enough.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wait, there's more.

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're different from competitors.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

173
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Jeez, is that all?

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Almost.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Here, you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow, and profits.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Umm, I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So it was pretty interesting that he wanted to quit his job and just, you know, set up a business, but actually, many people say that business plans are unnecessary.

183
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Really?

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Do these people have lots of money and they don't need investors?

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think the problem is that there are many books out there that give you clear examples of companies, Fortune 500 companies, that started out without a business plan.

186
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So I think many people take this as a rule, like, well, they didn't need one or it's not really necessary or why should I write up a business plan?

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, I'm not an entrepreneur and I'm not a business person, but my feeling is that a business plan is as much for investors as it is for yourself.

188
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It helps you clarify your goals, it helps you explain your objectives to your future colleagues, and I think it's just a really good way to map out the first year of a business because it tends to, a lot of businesses fail in that first year, so I think this is a really important step.

189
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:22,000
