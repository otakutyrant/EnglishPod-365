00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:08,900
EnglishPod.com I've had it!

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,199
So what are you going to do?

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:13,939
Just quit?

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,399
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,760
I've decided to create my own company.

7
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:23,140
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,780
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

9
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,120
Well, no.

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,600
It can't be that hard.

11
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:34,320
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how are you going to do things, and that's it, right?

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,060
You couldn't be more wrong.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,960
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,840
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.

15
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,979
Well, that seems easy enough.

16
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:50,979
Wait, there's more!

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,619
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're different from competitors.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,539
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,859
You need to investigate and analyse hundreds of variables.

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:10,140
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,840
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,599
Geez, is that all?

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,439
Almost.

24
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:25,980
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,500
Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,680
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,000
I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.
