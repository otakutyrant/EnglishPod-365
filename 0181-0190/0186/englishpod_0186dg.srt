1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com I've had it!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm done working for a company that is taking me nowhere.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So what are you going to do?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Just quit?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've decided to create my own company.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm going to write up a business plan, get some investors and start working for myself.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Have you ever written up a business plan before?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, no.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It can't be that hard.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how are you going to do things, and that's it, right?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You couldn't be more wrong.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A well-written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, that seems easy enough.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wait, there's more!

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, what they are and how they're different from competitors.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then comes the hard part, a market analysis.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You need to investigate and analyse hundreds of variables.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Geez, is that all?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Almost.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Here you will calculate and estimate sales, cash flow and profits.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
After all, people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.
