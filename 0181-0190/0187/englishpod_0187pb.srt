00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,139
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:05,919
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,140
My name is Catherine, and today we have an intermediate level lesson for you English learners out there.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,039
That's right.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,219
On this occasion, we are going on a diet, so we're trying to lose weight.

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,239
Uh-oh.

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,059
Well, there's a reason behind it.

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,219
Let's take a look at that reason in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,600
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,380
All right, so today on Vocabulary Preview, we have a noun, and it's a bridesmaid.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,240
A bridesmaid, a person.

12
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,840
So this is kind of like a job, but it's a short job.

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,079
You do it when your friend gets married.

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,479
It's the person, the woman, who stands next to her friend on the friend's wedding day.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,240
That's right, and usually bridesmaids want to lose weight because they have to get into this dress, right?

16
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:51,979
That's right.

17
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,299
They have special dresses.

18
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,219
They have to make their friend look good.

19
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,159
They have to, uh, match each other, actually, because usually there's three or four girls.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,460
They all have to wear the same outfit, so it's very stressful.

21
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,060
Okay.

22
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,739
All right, so we're going to see what's going on in this dialogue, and we'll be back shortly.

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,079
Oh, man.

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,340
I've been starving myself for days now, and I haven't lost an ounce.

25
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:19,939
Are you trying to lose weight?

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,700
Yeah.

27
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,980
My friend is getting married next month, and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

28
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,200
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

29
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,019
Look at these love handles.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,900
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

31
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,819
I think that's where you're going wrong.

32
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:35,579
Why?

33
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:39,299
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

34
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:40,700
Not really.

35
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:45,420
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts, or saturated fats.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,379
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

37
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,700
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat?

38
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,420
Yes.

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,299
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates in foods that are high in cholesterol.

40
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,400
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

41
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,400
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Don't count on it.

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,479
All right, we're back.

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,520
So I think there were a lot of interesting words related to food and to losing weight.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,620
So why don't we take a look now at language takeaway?

46
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,020
Okay, this first phrase in language takeaway is a phrase that the girl says about herself.

47
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
She's trying to lose weight.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,699
She's been starving herself, or she says, I've been starving myself.

49
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,099
All right, I've been starving myself.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,099
So to starve yourself is to make yourself not eat.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,639
So to starve is a verb.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,340
It means to not give someone food.

54
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,580
But to starve yourself, to starve oneself, is reflexive.

55
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,860
I'm doing it to myself, and it means that I'm not giving myself any food.

56
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,520
Okay, so you're starving yourself basically to lose weight.

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,240
And she said, well, I've been starving myself for days, and I haven't lost an ounce.

58
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:08,319
What is an ounce?

59
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,159
It's a good question.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,400
An ounce is a kind of weight, so like a kilogram or a gram or a pound.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,960
But an ounce is a very, very small measurement.

62
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,819
Okay, and this is in the imperial system.

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,539
So maybe a lot of our listeners aren't familiar with it.

64
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,419
But usually, for example, pounds and ounces go together, just like grams and kilograms.

65
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,199
Exactly.

66
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,479
So I might be wrong.

67
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,379
I think there are 16 ounces in a pound.

68
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,139
So if you think about it, a pound, you say, oh, I lost a pound.

69
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,819
16 ounces, she hasn't even lost an ounce.

70
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,340
That's a way to say she hasn't lost any weight yet.

71
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,080
All right.

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,780
So she was complaining about not losing weight.

73
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:47,520
And she said, look at these love handles.

74
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,759
What are love handles?

75
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:51,659
I love this phrase because you can imagine them.

76
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:54,560
So imagine hugging someone, and your hands are on their waist.

77
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,680
And maybe they have a little extra fat.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,280
Those are like love handles.

79
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,039
A handle is what you have on a door.

80
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,860
You turn the handle, and the door opens.

81
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,060
But this is fat on someone's side.

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,139
So a man or a woman can have fat on their hips.

83
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,259
And this is called love handles.

84
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,879
Okay, so love handles.

85
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,219
It's a nice way of saying that extra little fat that people have on their sides.

86
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:16,300
All right.

87
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:25,259
And now talking more specifically about words related to food, we have one that maybe most of you are familiar with, calories.

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,180
Calories.

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,660
So calorie is a measurement of energy in food.

90
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,019
Right.

91
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,079
And so a lot of women and some men too like to avoid eating many calories.

92
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,399
They say, oh, that Snickers bar that has 1,000 calories.

93
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,620
That's right.

94
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:46,980
Actually, if you look at your food labels, it usually says that a daily diet should include more or less 2,000 calories.

95
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,639
All right.

96
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,680
Another thing to avoid are saturated fats.

97
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,759
So there's fat, and there's saturated fat.

98
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:55,920
Marco, what's the difference?

99
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,959
I have no idea.

100
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,199
Come on.

101
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,399
There are two different types of fat.

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Some of them are good for you.

103
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,160
Your body needs fat, right?

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,779
But saturated fats are the ones that are more difficult for your body to absorb and to make them work for you.

105
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,339
So usually they accumulate, and that's why maybe they will, for example, make you a little bit fatter.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,540
So a lot of sweets have saturated fats, oily foods have saturated fats, and it's good to avoid those.

107
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,139
Right.

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,079
And well, stay away from saturated fats and artificial flavors.

109
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,519
So the word artificial can be used with many different things.

110
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,379
Because it means fake, not natural.

111
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,540
So you could say you have artificial flowers or artificial scents.

112
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,180
But in this case, we have artificial flavors.

113
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,720
That means fake flavors.

114
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,699
It's orange flavored, but there's no oranges.

115
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
It never came from an orange.

116
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,319
So you have to be careful with these because they use, because in many food products, chemicals are used.

117
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:55,620
Right.

118
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,899
And sugars, for example.

119
00:05:56,899 --> 00:06:04,720
So as you said, if you want to make something taste like orange, maybe they will use different chemicals and sugars to make it taste like orange.

120
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,439
Exactly.

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,180
The last thing we have to avoid is this word cholesterol.

122
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:10,319
Cholesterol.

123
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:10,819
Okay.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,920
So these are found, for example, in eggs have a lot of cholesterol.

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,600
Or even just meats in general, like red meat.

126
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:27,540
And so people with heart problems are told to avoid cholesterol because it can actually it can prevent the blood going to your heart.

127
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,660
It blocks up your heart.

128
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,740
So cholesterol is another bad one.

129
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,220
All right.

130
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,079
So all of these words are nouns and they're related to dieting and to food.

131
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,720
So I think we should listen to this dialogue again and keep a lookout for these words.

132
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,579
Oh, man, I've been starving myself for days now and I haven't lost an ounce.

133
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,199
Are you trying to lose weight?

134
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:50,980
Yeah.

135
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,199
My friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

136
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,459
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

137
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,240
Look at these love handles.

138
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,139
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

139
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,040
I think that's where you're going wrong.

140
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:05,819
Why?

141
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,560
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

142
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:10,939
Not really.

143
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,660
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats.

144
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,620
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

145
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,939
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat.

146
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,660
Yes.

147
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,540
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates in foods that are high in cholesterol.

148
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,660
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

149
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,639
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

150
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,759
Don't count on it.

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,240
All right, we're back.

152
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,300
So now we're going to take a look at two phrases on Fluency Builder.

153
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,699
Fluency Builder.

154
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:55,680
Okay, this first phrase is something that the girl who is dieting says.

155
00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:03,519
She says, are you saying that I should eat because she's starving herself, but that the important thing is that I watch what I eat.

156
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,100
So what does this watch what I eat?

157
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:10,800
All right, so to watch what you eat is to be careful of what you eat or to take care.

158
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,040
So it doesn't actually mean to look at your food a lot.

159
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,500
You don't have to stare at your food.

160
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,339
You just have to be careful or to pay attention to what you're eating.

161
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,160
So you should watch what you eat.

162
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,980
So that means pay attention.

163
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,480
Does it have lots of calories?

164
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,319
Is there a lot of cholesterol?

165
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,160
Things like this.

166
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,460
For example, you may see signs in some places that say watch your step.

167
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,980
So be careful where you're stepping.

168
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,500
Well, this next phrase is the very last phrase.

169
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:41,299
The friend says, do you think I can lose 20 pounds?

170
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:45,000
And for those of you who use kilos, this is about eight kilos.

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,940
That's a lot of weight.

172
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,759
And the answer is don't count on it.

173
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,399
So what is this?

174
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,320
Don't count on it.

175
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:50,840
All right.

176
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:51,840
Don't count on it.

177
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,179
Take that as a phrase.

178
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,000
It basically means that probably won't happen.

179
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,740
So you think you can come to my birthday party?

180
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
No, don't count on it.

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,820
I'll be busy.

182
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,220
Oh, so that means that means he probably won't.

183
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,940
Marco probably won't come, right?

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,879
So that means that you shouldn't expect it to happen because he can't promise that it will.

185
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,299
Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.

186
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,740
Don't expect it to happen.

187
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,799
So, for example, don't count on winning the lottery anytime soon.

188
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,580
Why not?

189
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,159
Because it's very difficult, right?

190
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,000
So don't count on it.

191
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,340
Or you can say, don't count on this train being on time.

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,039
It's always at least a half an hour late.

193
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,659
Exactly.

194
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:29,519
All right.

195
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:31,000
So many different examples there.

196
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:33,899
And I think we should listen to our dialogue for the last time.

197
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,100
Oh, man.

198
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,279
I've been starving myself for days now, and I haven't lost an ounce.

199
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,940
Are you trying to lose weight?

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,960
Yeah, my friend is getting married next month, and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

201
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,179
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

202
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,000
Look at these love handles.

203
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,899
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,779
I think that's where you're going wrong.

205
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:03,600
Why?

206
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:07,320
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

207
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,700
Not really.

208
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,440
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts, or saturated fats.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,419
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

210
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,700
So are you saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat?

211
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:20,419
Yes.

212
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,299
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates in foods that are high in cholesterol.

213
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,399
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

214
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,379
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

215
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,179
Don't count on it.

216
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,820
All right, we're back.

217
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,720
So these are some pretty healthy tips, right?

218
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,679
Watch what you eat and don't starve yourself.

219
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,799
Starving yourself, I think, is, well, obviously very unhealthy.

220
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,179
To starve, to die of starvation, that's the noun.

221
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,720
Not a very pretty way to go.

222
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:14,419
I've actually also heard that people that start to eat less, right, to maybe just eat once a day, their body actually thinks that there isn't much food around, so they start to store up these fats and these calories, energy, instead of releasing them normally.

223
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:20,179
So instead of actually losing weight, you actually gain weight because the moment that you eat, your body stores everything.

224
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:21,059
Exactly.

225
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,360
So instead of getting rid of those good fats, your body stores them with the saturated fats.

226
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:30,659
And you are doing the opposite to your body that you should be doing.

227
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:44,779
So the best recommendation that I've always heard is to avoid eating too much red meat, balance your diet out, eat lots of fruit as well, have those good sugars, and avoid artificial foods.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,779
Drink a lot of water.

229
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,720
Drink a lot of water.

230
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,500
And exercise.

231
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:48,460
Exercise, yeah.

232
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,539
This is the key thing.

233
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:56,120
I think many people rely only on dieting or eating less, but actually nothing can take its place more than exercise.

234
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,120
And exercise is really great because it tones those muscles.

235
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,600
So once you actually lose the weight, you feel good, you have muscles, you have more energy, and it helps you sleep.

236
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,240
