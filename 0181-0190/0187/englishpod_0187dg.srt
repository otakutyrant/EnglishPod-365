EnglishPod.com Oh man, I've been starving myself for days now and I haven't lost an ounce.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are you trying to lose weight?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Look at these love handles.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think that's where you're going wrong.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Not really.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates in foods that are high in cholesterol.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't count on it.
