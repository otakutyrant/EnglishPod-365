EnglishPod.com Oh man, I've been starving myself for days now and I haven't lost an ounce.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,800
Are you trying to lose weight?

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,839
Yeah, my friend is getting married next month and I'm supposed to be a bridesmaid.

4
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:21,039
I have to fit into my dress and look nice for her wedding, but I haven't lost any weight.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,899
Look at these love handles.

6
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:25,760
You don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

7
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,640
I think that's where you're going wrong.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,420
Why?

9
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,179
If I eat less, then my body will start eating away at my fat reserves, right?

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,539
Not really.

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,280
You should try to not eat foods high in calories, salts or saturated fats.

12
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:41,280
Stay away from oily food and artificial flavors.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,560
So you're saying that I should eat, but I should just watch what I eat.

14
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:45,259
Yes.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,140
You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates in foods that are high in cholesterol.

16
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,200
You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,259
If I do all of this, you think I can lose 20 pounds in four weeks?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,100
Don't count on it.
