00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,980
My name is Katherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,720
That's right.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,219
We are going to talk about winter, but specifically about the clothes you wear during winter when it's very, very cold outside.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,160
That's right, and I hear you're not too familiar with some of these practices, because where you come from, you don't really have winter.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,140
We don't have winter.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,920
We have dry season and rainy season, but same temperature.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,100
Well, Chicago definitely has a snowy season, so I'm very familiar with these things.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,880
So let's jump right into today's dialogue.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,780
We'll be hearing it one time, and in a minute, we'll be back to talk about it.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,740
Bye, Mom.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:49,820
Wait, Jimmy.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,840
It's cold outside.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,740
Put a hat on.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,420
Okay, bye.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,420
No, wait.

18
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,020
You'll be too cold without mittens.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,179
All right, see you.

20
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,200
Hold on.

21
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,859
With that wind, you're going to catch a cold.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,759
Wear this scarf.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,980
Okay, see you after school.

24
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:12,260
Oh, and earmuffs.

25
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,040
Put these on.

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,180
Here we go.

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:15,879
Mom?

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,040
Yes, honey?

29
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,239
I...

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,359
I can't breathe.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,180
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:33,819
So there were a couple of different items of clothing that we saw in this dialogue, so let's look at them now in language takeaway.

33
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:37,099
Language takeaway.

34
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:40,819
Okay, well, first of all, we have Mom and Jimmy.

35
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,140
Jimmy is a boy's name.

36
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,359
He's a little boy, and Mom is saying goodbye to him, but first she wants him to put on clothes.

37
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,239
So the first item, the first thing she asks him to put on is a hat.

38
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,099
A hat.

39
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:03,780
Now, you've probably seen, like, a baseball cap or many different types of hats, and sometimes in other languages they have specific names for a hat for winter, right?

40
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,140
But in English it's a hat.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,460
Anything that covers your head is a hat.

42
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,159
That's kind of like the category.

43
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,719
So maybe this one is a warm wool hat, but in the end it's a hat.

44
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:17,319
It's a hat.

45
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,319
Okay, so he's put on the hat.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,740
Now what else is he going to put on?

47
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,759
Well, we need to keep our fingers warm.

48
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:31,560
Okay, so there are two kinds of ways to keep your fingers warm, and the way in this dialogue that the boy keeps his fingers warm is with mittens.

49
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,039
Alright, so mittens you put on your hands.

50
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,400
Now, what's the difference between mittens and gloves?

51
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,080
Okay, gloves have special places for each finger.

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
One, two, three, four, five on each hand.

53
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,819
And mittens, there's two spaces, one for your thumb and one for all your other fingers.

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,319
Okay.

55
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,580
Okay, so that means you can't really hold things.

56
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,000
So you kind of look like a penguin or something like that.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,599
Yeah, you look like a, yeah, exactly, like a penguin.

58
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,479
And it's mostly for children.

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:06,539
Adults don't wear mittens because adults need to hold things like keys and phones and car steering wheels.

60
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,180
So in this case mittens is usually for children.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,840
Okay, so mittens, and while the mother is still a little bit worried, so she tells him to wear a scarf.

62
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:25,759
Okay, a scarf is a long, usually made of wool, a long piece of fabric that you put around your neck to keep your neck warm.

63
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,240
Okay, so a scarf.

64
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:27,919
A scarf.

65
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,960
Okay, and he's put on the mittens, the scarf, the hat, and he's missing some earmuffs.

66
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,219
Okay, this is a little funny because usually if you're wearing a hat, you don't need earmuffs.

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,000
But earmuffs are like headphones, but they keep your ears warm.

68
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:43,460
Right.

69
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,180
And we wear these, they don't cover your head, they just cover your ears.

70
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,099
And usually they're just two round circles over your ears.

71
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,979
So as you say, exactly, they look like big earphones.

72
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:56,060
And they keep your ears warm.

73
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,139
Now, as you say, you usually don't wear this if you're wearing a hat because, well, you would put your ears inside your hat, right?

74
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,259
So it looks pretty silly if he's wearing all of this together.

75
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:14,120
Alright, and so those four key items, those four key pieces of clothing, are for our language takeaway today.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,860
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll come back soon to talk about Fluency Builder.

77
00:04:36,219 --> 00:04:38,519
Okay, see you after school.

78
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:54,620
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:04,279
Okay, this first phrase, as I said before, has to do with the mum and the boy saying goodbye to each other.

80
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,319
So he says, alright, see ya.

81
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,680
See ya.

82
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,120
Ya.

83
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,339
Okay, so see as in to look, to, right, you see something.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,720
And what about ya?

85
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:18,779
So this is a very spoken language way of saying you.

86
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:25,220
So we could say see you later, but if you want to make it shorter, you can say see ya.

87
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,180
See ya, bye.

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,120
Bye, goodbye.

89
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,779
Alright, so see ya.

90
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,560
And then what's our next way of saying goodbye?

91
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,480
Hold on.

92
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,839
Oh wait, that's...

93
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,079
We're not there yet, no.

94
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,839
Hold on is our next phrase, and this is a way to say wait.

95
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,040
Wait, hold on.

96
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,800
So you just say hold on, it means wait.

97
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,040
It's not really rude, right?

98
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,480
It's just a little bit more casual.

99
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:50,000
Exactly, it's very casual, so you cannot say hold.

100
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:51,459
That doesn't make sense.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,120
You have to use these two words together.

102
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,199
Hold on.

103
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,560
So like I said before with Marco, who wants to go fast, I could say hold on.

104
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,000
Hold on.

105
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,740
Wait a second.

106
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,160
Alright.

107
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,579
Okay, so hold on, see ya.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,800
And now you gotta be careful because you're going to catch a cold.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
To catch a cold.

110
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:18,839
Okay, so a cold is when you cough, you have a sore throat, it's starting to get cold outside, and you don't feel well, okay?

111
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,319
So you have a runny nose.

112
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,139
It's an illness.

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,519
And most people get this every year.

114
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:25,779
It's very common.

115
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,560
But you don't get a cold, you catch a cold, okay?

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,980
So catch is the same word we use for when we talk about sports, like throwing and catching.

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,740
It's almost like it just hits you, it's so fast, you just catch a cold.

118
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,800
So that's really important what you just said, because you don't use the verb get.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,620
You don't get a cold, you catch a cold.

120
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,439
Or if you say that you were sick last week because you had a cold, you would say, oh, I caught a cold.

121
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,600
Or I had a cold.

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,600
Exactly, so remember present tense, I catch a cold.

123
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,360
Past tense, I caught a cold last week.

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:00,899
Okay.

125
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,600
And our last phrase for Fluency Builder is here we go.

126
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,540
Here we go.

127
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,079
Okay, so when do we hear this phrase?

128
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,300
The mother says to the boy, put these on.

129
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:10,439
Here we go.

130
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,439
So she's doing something with him.

131
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:15,100
She's helping him put his earmuffs on.

132
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:18,319
And here we go is a way to say, okay, I've finished.

133
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,720
Okay, I'm done.

134
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,800
Okay, your earmuffs are on you.

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,100
So you're ready, here you go.

136
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:23,680
Here you go.

137
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,699
Right, so we say here we go, like everything is ready, your earmuffs are on.

138
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,160
Exactly, so maybe I'm on my computer and I have a problem and I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.

139
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,139
And you know when the bar's loading.

140
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,160
And finally, ding, it's ready, here we go.

141
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,019
Here we go, it's ready.

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,720
Now I can start, it's ready.

143
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,959
Or sometimes a waitress will come and serve you food and say, here we go, here's your order.

144
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,980
Exactly, so this is a way to say what you've been waiting for, it's ready now.

145
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:54,199
Okay, great, so I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one last time before we come back.

146
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,319
Here we go.

147
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,819
Bye, mom.

148
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:04,839
Wait, Jimmy, it's cold outside, put a hat on.

149
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,519
Okay, bye.

150
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,100
No, wait, you'll be too cold without mittens.

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,240
Alright, see ya.

152
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,899
Hold on, with that wind you're gonna catch a cold.

153
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,819
Wear this scarf.

154
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,060
Okay, see you after school.

155
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,120
Oh, and earmuffs, put these on.

156
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,600
Here we go.

157
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:28,959
Mom?

158
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,120
Yes, honey?

159
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,480
I, I can't breathe.

160
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:45,899
Alright, we're back, so as you mentioned in Chicago it's very, very cold, so I imagine you had all of these winter clothes, right?

161
00:08:45,899 --> 00:09:10,980
That's right, and it's funny because I remember being a small child and my mother doing this to me, putting on snow pants and boots and earmuffs and hats and gloves and scarves and all of a sudden it's so hot inside because you're wearing everything and so you can't even walk like you were saying, you look like a penguin walking out the door and you get to school and you're sweating, right?

162
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:20,759
And so in school we had to take, we had a special room and we had to take everything off because there's snow everywhere and snow can be very dangerous because it melts and it turns into water.

163
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,799
Okay, so I have very strong memories of all of this, putting them on, taking them off and just being warm all the time.

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,919
Well, yeah, when it's cold or you live in a place with cold weather you have to have these items of clothing because otherwise you might catch a cold.

165
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:46,899
Exactly, so I hope that no one out there catches a cold, but if you want some suggestions, wear a scarf, cover your neck, that's the most important, your head and your scarf are the most important.
