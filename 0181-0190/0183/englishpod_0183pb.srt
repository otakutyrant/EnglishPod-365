00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We are going to talk about winter, but specifically about the clothes you wear during winter when it's very, very cold outside.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right, and I hear you're not too familiar with some of these practices, because where you come from, you don't really have winter.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We don't have winter.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have dry season and rainy season, but same temperature.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well, Chicago definitely has a snowy season, so I'm very familiar with these things.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's jump right into today's dialogue.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll be hearing it one time, and in a minute, we'll be back to talk about it.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Bye, Mom.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wait, Jimmy.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's cold outside.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Put a hat on.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, bye.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, wait.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You'll be too cold without mittens.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right, see you.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hold on.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
With that wind, you're going to catch a cold.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wear this scarf.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, see you after school.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, and earmuffs.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Put these on.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here we go.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Mom?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, honey?

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I...

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't breathe.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So there were a couple of different items of clothing that we saw in this dialogue, so let's look at them now in language takeaway.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Language takeaway.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, well, first of all, we have Mom and Jimmy.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Jimmy is a boy's name.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He's a little boy, and Mom is saying goodbye to him, but first she wants him to put on clothes.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So the first item, the first thing she asks him to put on is a hat.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A hat.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now, you've probably seen, like, a baseball cap or many different types of hats, and sometimes in other languages they have specific names for a hat for winter, right?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But in English it's a hat.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Anything that covers your head is a hat.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's kind of like the category.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So maybe this one is a warm wool hat, but in the end it's a hat.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a hat.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, so he's put on the hat.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now what else is he going to put on?

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, we need to keep our fingers warm.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so there are two kinds of ways to keep your fingers warm, and the way in this dialogue that the boy keeps his fingers warm is with mittens.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, so mittens you put on your hands.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now, what's the difference between mittens and gloves?

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay, gloves have special places for each finger.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
One, two, three, four, five on each hand.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And mittens, there's two spaces, one for your thumb and one for all your other fingers.

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, so that means you can't really hold things.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So you kind of look like a penguin or something like that.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah, you look like a, yeah, exactly, like a penguin.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And it's mostly for children.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Adults don't wear mittens because adults need to hold things like keys and phones and car steering wheels.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So in this case mittens is usually for children.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, so mittens, and while the mother is still a little bit worried, so she tells him to wear a scarf.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, a scarf is a long, usually made of wool, a long piece of fabric that you put around your neck to keep your neck warm.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, so a scarf.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
A scarf.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, and he's put on the mittens, the scarf, the hat, and he's missing some earmuffs.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, this is a little funny because usually if you're wearing a hat, you don't need earmuffs.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But earmuffs are like headphones, but they keep your ears warm.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And we wear these, they don't cover your head, they just cover your ears.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And usually they're just two round circles over your ears.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So as you say, exactly, they look like big earphones.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And they keep your ears warm.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now, as you say, you usually don't wear this if you're wearing a hat because, well, you would put your ears inside your hat, right?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So it looks pretty silly if he's wearing all of this together.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright, and so those four key items, those four key pieces of clothing, are for our language takeaway today.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why don't we listen to this dialogue again, and we'll come back soon to talk about Fluency Builder.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, see you after school.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, this first phrase, as I said before, has to do with the mum and the boy saying goodbye to each other.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So he says, alright, see ya.

81
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
See ya.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Ya.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, so see as in to look, to, right, you see something.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And what about ya?

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So this is a very spoken language way of saying you.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So we could say see you later, but if you want to make it shorter, you can say see ya.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
See ya, bye.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Bye, goodbye.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Alright, so see ya.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And then what's our next way of saying goodbye?

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hold on.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh wait, that's...

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're not there yet, no.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hold on is our next phrase, and this is a way to say wait.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wait, hold on.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So you just say hold on, it means wait.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not really rude, right?

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's just a little bit more casual.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Exactly, it's very casual, so you cannot say hold.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That doesn't make sense.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You have to use these two words together.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hold on.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So like I said before with Marco, who wants to go fast, I could say hold on.

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hold on.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Wait a second.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Alright.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, so hold on, see ya.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And now you gotta be careful because you're going to catch a cold.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
To catch a cold.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, so a cold is when you cough, you have a sore throat, it's starting to get cold outside, and you don't feel well, okay?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So you have a runny nose.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's an illness.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And most people get this every year.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's very common.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But you don't get a cold, you catch a cold, okay?

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So catch is the same word we use for when we talk about sports, like throwing and catching.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's almost like it just hits you, it's so fast, you just catch a cold.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So that's really important what you just said, because you don't use the verb get.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You don't get a cold, you catch a cold.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Or if you say that you were sick last week because you had a cold, you would say, oh, I caught a cold.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Or I had a cold.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Exactly, so remember present tense, I catch a cold.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Past tense, I caught a cold last week.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And our last phrase for Fluency Builder is here we go.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Here we go.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, so when do we hear this phrase?

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The mother says to the boy, put these on.

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Here we go.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So she's doing something with him.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She's helping him put his earmuffs on.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And here we go is a way to say, okay, I've finished.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, I'm done.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, your earmuffs are on you.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So you're ready, here you go.

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here you go.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Right, so we say here we go, like everything is ready, your earmuffs are on.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Exactly, so maybe I'm on my computer and I have a problem and I'm waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And you know when the bar's loading.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And finally, ding, it's ready, here we go.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here we go, it's ready.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now I can start, it's ready.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Or sometimes a waitress will come and serve you food and say, here we go, here's your order.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Exactly, so this is a way to say what you've been waiting for, it's ready now.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, great, so I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue one last time before we come back.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here we go.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Bye, mom.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait, Jimmy, it's cold outside, put a hat on.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, bye.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, wait, you'll be too cold without mittens.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, see ya.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hold on, with that wind you're gonna catch a cold.

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Wear this scarf.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, see you after school.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, and earmuffs, put these on.

156
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Here we go.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mom?

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes, honey?

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I, I can't breathe.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Alright, we're back, so as you mentioned in Chicago it's very, very cold, so I imagine you had all of these winter clothes, right?

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's right, and it's funny because I remember being a small child and my mother doing this to me, putting on snow pants and boots and earmuffs and hats and gloves and scarves and all of a sudden it's so hot inside because you're wearing everything and so you can't even walk like you were saying, you look like a penguin walking out the door and you get to school and you're sweating, right?

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And so in school we had to take, we had a special room and we had to take everything off because there's snow everywhere and snow can be very dangerous because it melts and it turns into water.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, so I have very strong memories of all of this, putting them on, taking them off and just being warm all the time.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Well, yeah, when it's cold or you live in a place with cold weather you have to have these items of clothing because otherwise you might catch a cold.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Exactly, so I hope that no one out there catches a cold, but if you want some suggestions, wear a scarf, cover your neck, that's the most important, your head and your scarf are the most important.
