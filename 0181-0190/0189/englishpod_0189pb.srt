00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,099
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,140
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson all about cell phones.

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:16,100
That's right, we're going to be buying a cell phone or also known as a mobile phone.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,739
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at a specific type of phone on vocabulary preview.

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,960
Vocabulary preview.

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:36,479
Well the name of this phone is kind of funny, it's called a smartphone, it's very popular these days, things like the Apple iPhone or the HTC Hero, these are examples of a smartphone.

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,560
That's right, so basically a smartphone has additional functions, more than just a normal mobile phone.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,179
For example, you can check your email on a smartphone.

9
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,979
Yeah, so the thing that makes a smartphone different from a normal mobile phone is that it's like a small computer.

10
00:00:51,979 --> 00:01:01,479
Sure, you can do things like Marco said, send emails or take photos, edit photos, use applications, things like that from your phone.

11
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,879
Okay, so we're going to be talking about smartphones, so let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,280
Hello sir, may I help you?

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,140
Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

14
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:20,519
I see.

15
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, you've come to the right place.

16
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:27,620
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

17
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:28,879
Sounds good.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,340
I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

19
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,599
We have this new HTC smartphone.

20
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,299
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

21
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,700
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player and touch screen.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,420
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

23
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:49,719
What about Wi-Fi?

24
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,540
Of course.

25
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:54,439
You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

26
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:56,719
One last thing, is it waterproof?

27
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,659
Alright, we're back.

28
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,359
Now, have you ever done this?

29
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,739
Have you ever dropped your phone in the water?

30
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,060
Have you ever damaged the phone like that?

31
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,199
Luckily, no.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,159
Knock on wood.

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,580
But I have a good friend who dropped his in the toilet and had to buy a new one, so this is not made up.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,099
It's actually more common than what people think, but we'll get to that in a bit.

35
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,620
Why don't we take a look at five key words in language takeaway?

36
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,659
This first word is very important because in this particular dialogue, we're talking about the HTC smartphone.

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,460
This is a special kind of phone and it has an Android operating system or OS.

38
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:51,439
So Android is something that Google came up with and they have this operating system that they're giving away for free.

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,240
If you want to use it, you can use it.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,520
You can make a whole new phone using this operating system.

41
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,379
So the operating system like Windows or what's the Mac one called?

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,180
Tiger OS.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,479
Tiger OS.

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,340
You have these...

45
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,659
Linux, yeah.

46
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:08,139
Linux.

47
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:08,300
Linux.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:16,879
These are like the interface that allows you to use your computer and to interact with it and so they're different for different kinds of computers, but the same is true of a smartphone.

49
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:17,819
Exactly.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,580
So that's what we're looking at today.

51
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:30,080
If you see this word Android, it's a proper noun and as Catherine mentioned, it's the name of the OS or operating system developed by Google.

52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,500
So we're taking a look at a smartphone that uses the Android OS.

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,319
All right.

54
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,039
Now this phone not only carried this operating system, but also an MP3 player.

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,400
That's right.

56
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:46,599
So an MP3 player is a device that plays songs for you.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,560
So songs can be stored as MP3s and a good example of an MP3 player is an iPod.

58
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,199
An iPod.

59
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:53,719
Exactly.

60
00:03:53,979 --> 00:04:00,199
And for many of you, you're listening to this podcast as an MP3 file through an MP3 player.

61
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:01,240
So that's the name.

62
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,780
We usually say MP3.

63
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:10,919
And another feature of this special smartphone is that you can use it on the 3G network.

64
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,539
What is a 3G network Marco?

65
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:12,979
All right.

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,220
So a 3G network is a third generation network, which allows more information to be sent.

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:28,079
So not only can you send voice like a normal cell phone network, but now you can send pictures or you can download information like for example, your email.

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,860
So this is a new 3G network.

69
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,139
It allows you to send more information, more data.

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,699
3G, third generation.

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,160
And in addition to this, our customer wants to know about Wi-Fi.

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:41,759
Okay.

73
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,660
Wi-Fi, you hear this a lot when you go to a hotel or a restaurant, they say we have Wi-Fi access.

74
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,339
Right.

75
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,000
And Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,259
So it's basically internet that has no wires.

77
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,480
You don't need to connect your computer to anything.

78
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,540
You just log on and use the internet.

79
00:04:59,379 --> 00:04:59,740
All right.

80
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,420
So look out for that when you're in a cafe next time.

81
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,420
Do they have Wi-Fi?

82
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,060
Usually, there's a sign on the wall.

83
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,120
And finally, this customer wants to know, is this great phone waterproof?

84
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:10,980
What is waterproof?

85
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:11,959
All right.

86
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:18,839
So if you have a watch, for example, and you can take this watch into a swimming pool or the ocean, it means it's waterproof.

87
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,680
So it resists water.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,699
It won't get damaged if it gets wet.

89
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,220
Great.

90
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,279
So I could say that I have a waterproof jacket, right?

91
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:33,139
So that means that when I go in the rain, my clothes don't get wet because they don't go inside the fabric.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,060
Right.

93
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,579
So and there are many things waterproof as watches or waterproof cameras.

94
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,439
I've never really seen a waterproof mobile phone, though.

95
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:41,920
That's a good invention, maybe.

96
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:42,560
That would be.

97
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:43,680
All right.

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,500
So those are five keywords for language takeaway.

99
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,959
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,819
Hello, sir.

101
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,019
May I help you?

102
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:56,860
Yeah.

103
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,000
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

104
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,319
I see.

105
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,800
Well, you've come to the right place.

106
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,399
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

107
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,680
Sounds good.

108
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,199
I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

109
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,439
We have this new HTC smartphone.

110
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,139
It comes with the Android OS, so you can download applications.

111
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:24,379
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touchscreen.

112
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:29,199
It works on the 3G network, so you have fast access to the Internet wherever you are.

113
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,519
What about Wi-Fi?

114
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:31,360
Of course.

115
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,220
You can access the Internet from any hotspot, as well as from home.

116
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,420
One last thing.

117
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,519
Is it waterproof?

118
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,480
All right, we're back.

119
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,399
So now we have three phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

120
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:52,920
Okay, this first phrase is a way of expressing something.

121
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,040
So we're going to give you a formula.

122
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,459
The first word is leading.

123
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,279
So leading mobile phone manufacturers.

124
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,740
So when we use the word leading, we're saying that it's leading an industry.

125
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,160
That means the most important manufacturers in a kind of industry.

126
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:08,480
Right.

127
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,500
So it's one of the biggest, it's one of the best.

128
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:17,319
And if we want to change the noun, we can say, for example, the leading car manufacturer.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,439
Exactly.

130
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,560
So in Japan, I wonder who the leading car manufacturer is.

131
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,100
Is it Toyota?

132
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:22,839
Toyota.

133
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,279
And we could also say that about clothing.

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,819
The leading clothing manufacturer in America is, I have no idea, cotton, maybe.

135
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,100
Cotton, right.

136
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,300
So you can use many other nouns.

137
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:45,740
And well, if you want to drop the manufacturers, you can say the leading brand in cosmetics or the leading supplier of medical equipment.

138
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:52,579
So this means the person or the company with the most, that's the most important in an industry.

139
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:59,800
And going back to one of the features of the mobile phone, we talked about the built-in camera.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now, this structure is interesting, built-in.

141
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,500
Well, we can say that things are built-in when they are a part of something else.

142
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,819
For example, a built-in camera is a part of a phone.

143
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,199
It's not a camera and a phone, two different devices.

144
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,240
They're put together.

145
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,639
We can also say this about cabinets.

146
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,240
You know, you can buy cabinets and you can put them in your house and keep things in them.

147
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,360
But we often have built-ins.

148
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,120
That means that they're stuck on the wall.

149
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,259
You can't take them away.

150
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,159
Those are called built-ins because they're part of the wall.

151
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,440
So built-in camera is a part of the phone.

152
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,340
So you can pretty much use this structure with two products that are combined as one.

153
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:49,899
For example, the cabinets that Catherine mentioned, or if your refrigerator has a television incorporated, you can say this refrigerator comes with a built-in television.

154
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:54,419
Or very common is the laptop with built-in speakers.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,419
So that means we don't have to bring speakers with us every time we want to use the laptop.

156
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,720
There's small speakers inside the computer.

157
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:01,919
Very good.

158
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
And we have one last phrase.

159
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,320
One last phrase.

160
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,519
One last thing.

161
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,000
All right.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,779
So that's our phrase.

163
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,639
One last thing.

164
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,960
Oh, before you go.

165
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,860
One last thing.

166
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,980
So this is often said when someone's leaving a conversation.

167
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,139
So I'm going to say, OK, Marco, I've got to go run and do something.

168
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,740
I'll see you later.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,379
Right.

170
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,580
One last thing.

172
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,179
Wait, what?

173
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,200
Oh, OK.

174
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,899
So now I'll wait.

175
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,899
So one last thing is a way to say, no, wait, hold on.

176
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,879
I have to tell you something else.

177
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,500
So yeah, as you say, you can use it as a fixed phrase.

178
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,299
One last thing.

179
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,019
Or before I go, one last thing.

180
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,500
Can you take out the dog?

181
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,960
One last thing we have to talk about.

182
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,320
Right.

183
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,279
And this was our last word.

184
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,740
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

185
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,919
Maybe something mid-range.

186
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:12,139
We have this new HTC smartphone.

187
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,820
It comes with the Android OS, so you can download applications.

188
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,220
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touch screen.

189
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,940
It works on the 3G network, so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

190
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,259
What about Wi-Fi?

191
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,120
Of course.

192
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,940
You can access the internet from any hotspot, as well as from home.

193
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,159
One last thing.

194
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:33,279
Is it waterproof?

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,580
All right, we're back.

196
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:50,220
And I actually read somewhere that many girls have this accident because they place their mobile phones in their back pockets.

197
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,759
So when they go to the bathroom, the phone accidentally drops out and falls into the toilet.

198
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,559
I heard a different explanation for this common problem.

199
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:08,159
Maybe not very appropriate, but boys have this problem because they take their phones to the bathroom and they play with them when they're using the bathroom.

200
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,399
I've also heard this, that you're maybe checking your messages or checking your email when you're in your bathroom.

201
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:13,159
It falls.

202
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:13,860
Just falls.

203
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,019
Yeah, so I think boys and girls all have this problem.

204
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,419
Be careful with your phones.

205
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:20,419
Those smartphones are still pretty expensive.

206
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,200
Yes, they are.

207
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,600

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:28,820
Bye.

210
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:35,639
Bye.
