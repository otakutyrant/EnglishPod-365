00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson all about cell phones.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right, we're going to be buying a cell phone or also known as a mobile phone.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So before we jump into the dialogue, let's take a look at a specific type of phone on vocabulary preview.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Vocabulary preview.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well the name of this phone is kind of funny, it's called a smartphone, it's very popular these days, things like the Apple iPhone or the HTC Hero, these are examples of a smartphone.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's right, so basically a smartphone has additional functions, more than just a normal mobile phone.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For example, you can check your email on a smartphone.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, so the thing that makes a smartphone different from a normal mobile phone is that it's like a small computer.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sure, you can do things like Marco said, send emails or take photos, edit photos, use applications, things like that from your phone.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, so we're going to be talking about smartphones, so let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello sir, may I help you?

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I see.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, you've come to the right place.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sounds good.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We have this new HTC smartphone.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player and touch screen.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What about Wi-Fi?

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Of course.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
One last thing, is it waterproof?

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Alright, we're back.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, have you ever done this?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Have you ever dropped your phone in the water?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Have you ever damaged the phone like that?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Luckily, no.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Knock on wood.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I have a good friend who dropped his in the toilet and had to buy a new one, so this is not made up.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's actually more common than what people think, but we'll get to that in a bit.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why don't we take a look at five key words in language takeaway?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This first word is very important because in this particular dialogue, we're talking about the HTC smartphone.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is a special kind of phone and it has an Android operating system or OS.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So Android is something that Google came up with and they have this operating system that they're giving away for free.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you want to use it, you can use it.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You can make a whole new phone using this operating system.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So the operating system like Windows or what's the Mac one called?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tiger OS.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Tiger OS.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You have these...

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Linux, yeah.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Linux.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Linux.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
These are like the interface that allows you to use your computer and to interact with it and so they're different for different kinds of computers, but the same is true of a smartphone.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Exactly.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So that's what we're looking at today.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you see this word Android, it's a proper noun and as Catherine mentioned, it's the name of the OS or operating system developed by Google.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we're taking a look at a smartphone that uses the Android OS.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All right.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now this phone not only carried this operating system, but also an MP3 player.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So an MP3 player is a device that plays songs for you.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So songs can be stored as MP3s and a good example of an MP3 player is an iPod.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
An iPod.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Exactly.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And for many of you, you're listening to this podcast as an MP3 file through an MP3 player.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So that's the name.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We usually say MP3.

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And another feature of this special smartphone is that you can use it on the 3G network.

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What is a 3G network Marco?

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So a 3G network is a third generation network, which allows more information to be sent.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So not only can you send voice like a normal cell phone network, but now you can send pictures or you can download information like for example, your email.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So this is a new 3G network.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It allows you to send more information, more data.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
3G, third generation.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And in addition to this, our customer wants to know about Wi-Fi.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wi-Fi, you hear this a lot when you go to a hotel or a restaurant, they say we have Wi-Fi access.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Right.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And Wi-Fi stands for wireless fidelity.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So it's basically internet that has no wires.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You don't need to connect your computer to anything.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You just log on and use the internet.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All right.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So look out for that when you're in a cafe next time.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do they have Wi-Fi?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Usually, there's a sign on the wall.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And finally, this customer wants to know, is this great phone waterproof?

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is waterproof?

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So if you have a watch, for example, and you can take this watch into a swimming pool or the ocean, it means it's waterproof.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So it resists water.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It won't get damaged if it gets wet.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Great.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So I could say that I have a waterproof jacket, right?

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So that means that when I go in the rain, my clothes don't get wet because they don't go inside the fabric.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So and there are many things waterproof as watches or waterproof cameras.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I've never really seen a waterproof mobile phone, though.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's a good invention, maybe.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That would be.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So those are five keywords for language takeaway.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hello, sir.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
May I help you?

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I see.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, you've come to the right place.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sounds good.

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We have this new HTC smartphone.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It comes with the Android OS, so you can download applications.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touchscreen.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It works on the 3G network, so you have fast access to the Internet wherever you are.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What about Wi-Fi?

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Of course.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You can access the Internet from any hotspot, as well as from home.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One last thing.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it waterproof?

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
All right, we're back.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So now we have three phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, this first phrase is a way of expressing something.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So we're going to give you a formula.

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The first word is leading.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So leading mobile phone manufacturers.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So when we use the word leading, we're saying that it's leading an industry.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That means the most important manufacturers in a kind of industry.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So it's one of the biggest, it's one of the best.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And if we want to change the noun, we can say, for example, the leading car manufacturer.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Exactly.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So in Japan, I wonder who the leading car manufacturer is.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is it Toyota?

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Toyota.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And we could also say that about clothing.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The leading clothing manufacturer in America is, I have no idea, cotton, maybe.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Cotton, right.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So you can use many other nouns.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And well, if you want to drop the manufacturers, you can say the leading brand in cosmetics or the leading supplier of medical equipment.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So this means the person or the company with the most, that's the most important in an industry.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And going back to one of the features of the mobile phone, we talked about the built-in camera.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now, this structure is interesting, built-in.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, we can say that things are built-in when they are a part of something else.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
For example, a built-in camera is a part of a phone.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's not a camera and a phone, two different devices.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They're put together.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
We can also say this about cabinets.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You know, you can buy cabinets and you can put them in your house and keep things in them.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But we often have built-ins.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That means that they're stuck on the wall.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You can't take them away.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Those are called built-ins because they're part of the wall.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So built-in camera is a part of the phone.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you can pretty much use this structure with two products that are combined as one.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
For example, the cabinets that Catherine mentioned, or if your refrigerator has a television incorporated, you can say this refrigerator comes with a built-in television.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Or very common is the laptop with built-in speakers.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So that means we don't have to bring speakers with us every time we want to use the laptop.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's small speakers inside the computer.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Very good.

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And we have one last phrase.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
One last phrase.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
One last thing.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All right.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So that's our phrase.

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
One last thing.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, before you go.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
One last thing.

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So this is often said when someone's leaving a conversation.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I'm going to say, OK, Marco, I've got to go run and do something.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll see you later.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
One last thing.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Wait, what?

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, OK.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So now I'll wait.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So one last thing is a way to say, no, wait, hold on.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have to tell you something else.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So yeah, as you say, you can use it as a fixed phrase.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
One last thing.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Or before I go, one last thing.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Can you take out the dog?

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
One last thing we have to talk about.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Right.

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And this was our last word.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time?

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Maybe something mid-range.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We have this new HTC smartphone.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It comes with the Android OS, so you can download applications.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touch screen.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It works on the 3G network, so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What about Wi-Fi?

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Of course.

192
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can access the internet from any hotspot, as well as from home.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
One last thing.

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Is it waterproof?

195
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All right, we're back.

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I actually read somewhere that many girls have this accident because they place their mobile phones in their back pockets.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So when they go to the bathroom, the phone accidentally drops out and falls into the toilet.

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I heard a different explanation for this common problem.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe not very appropriate, but boys have this problem because they take their phones to the bathroom and they play with them when they're using the bathroom.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've also heard this, that you're maybe checking your messages or checking your email when you're in your bathroom.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It falls.

202
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Just falls.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, so I think boys and girls all have this problem.

204
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Be careful with your phones.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Those smartphones are still pretty expensive.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes, they are.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000

Bye.

210

Bye.
