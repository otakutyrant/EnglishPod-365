1
00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:07,660
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:08,980
I see.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,439
Well, you've come to the right place.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,059
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,339
Sounds good.

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:20,859
I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,079
We have this new HTC smartphone.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,780
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,159
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touch screen.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,880
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,200
What about Wi-Fi?

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,060
Of course.

13
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,899
You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,060
One last thing.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,200
Is it waterproof?
