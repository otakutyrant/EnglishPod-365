1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I see.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, you've come to the right place.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We have over 100 models of more than 20 leading mobile phone manufacturers.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Sounds good.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We have this new HTC smartphone.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It also has a built-in camera, MP3 player, and touch screen.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What about Wi-Fi?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Of course.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
One last thing.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is it waterproof?
