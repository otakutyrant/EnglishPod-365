1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What do you think of this one?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Eh, so-so.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And this one?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Too flashy?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Nah, not too flashy.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ugh, and this sweater from my aunt.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Isn't it hideous?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I guess.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you even listening?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ugh, your precious game.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh, no you didn't.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why don't you just-just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I might just enjoy your stupid game.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then Merry Christmas.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Merry Christmas.
