1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,500
What do you think of this one?

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:11,099
Eh, so-so.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,019
And this one?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:12,820
Too flashy?

5
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:14,500
Nah, not too flashy.

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,879
Ugh, and this sweater from my aunt.

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:17,780
Isn't it hideous?

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:18,719
I guess.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you even listening?

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

11
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:25,820
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,859
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,960
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,960
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,740
Ugh, your precious game.

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,420
You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,159
Oh, no you didn't.

18
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,219
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

19
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,140
Why don't you just-just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,740
I might just enjoy your stupid game.

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,039
Then Merry Christmas.

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:01,859
Merry Christmas.
