00:00:02,759 --> 00:00:04,940
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,700
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,539
My name is Katherine, and today we have another holiday lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:14,519
It's an intermediate level lesson, but it's not about Christmas, and it's not about New Year's.

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,720
So what's this holiday, Marco?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,059
It's like after Christmas, but before New Year's.

7
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,800
Okay, so let's look at this holiday in today's vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,280
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,539
All right, so as you noticed in the title, this is called Boxing Day.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,719
Boom, boom, boom.

11
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:29,899
Right.

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,600
So like fighting boxing.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,880
No, no, no.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,219
Kind of like boxes, right?

15
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:35,759
It's more related to boxes.

16
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,259
So this is a holiday that we don't actually celebrate in America.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,579
It's celebrated in what are called Commonwealth countries.

18
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,039
That means countries that used to be a part of Great Britain or that are a part of Great Britain.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,439
So England, Scotland, Canada, Australia.

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,719
And this is a day where, well, it's considered a holiday because it's a bank holiday.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,979
That means all the banks close.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,140
No one's at work.

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,960
It's the day after Christmas, so it's December 26th.

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,939
And it's traditionally a day when you give money or gifts to the poor.

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,120
And so this is more or less what we're going to be talking about, but more modern, right?

26
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,760
Before it was like that, but now it's kind of become this shopping thing, right?

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,579
It has.

28
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,799
It's a day when everyone goes to the sales after Christmas to return things or to buy new things.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,420
So we're going to hear about this right away in today's dialogue.

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,280
And when we come back, we'll be talking about some of the phrases and words that you've heard.

31
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:40,219
What do you think of this one?

32
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:41,799
Eh, so-so.

33
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:42,739
And this one?

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,519
Too flashy?

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,200
Nah, not too flashy.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,579
Ugh, and this sweater from my aunt.

37
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,500
Isn't it hideous?

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,439
I guess.

39
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,700
Are you even listening?

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,459
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

41
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,239
And I'm trying to watch the game.

42
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,579
But you're yapping on about your new clothes.

43
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,560
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

44
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,700
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

45
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,740
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

46
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,479
Ugh, your precious game.

47
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,099
You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,919
Oh, no you didn't.

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,919
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

50
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:27,879
Why don't you just, just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

51
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:30,360
I might just enjoy your stupid game.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,740
And Merry Christmas!

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,560
Merry Christmas!

54
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,360
Alright, great, so we're back and, uh, interesting, the couple fighting right after Christmas.

55
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,460
Well, I think it's very common to hear fights around the holidays.

56
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,319
People are very stressed out.

57
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,539
And tired of dealing with family and presents and all the stress, right?

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,139
Exactly.

59
00:02:56,419 --> 00:02:58,759
But we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

60
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,379
Right now, why don't we take a look at four key words in Language Takeaway.

61
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,599
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,979
Okay, these first two words are words that the wife uses in talking about some of these clothes that she got as presents.

63
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,639
So she says, well, she asks her husband, is this too flashy?

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:20,800
Flashy.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,699
Flashy.

66
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,800
Alright, so, you know flash, like the camera flash, right?

67
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:25,740
This big light.

68
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:32,639
Now flashy, when you're talking about clothes or an object, is it, it's too noticeable, right?

69
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,580
It's too noticeable, too bright, too loud.

70
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,039
So for example, a black shirt is not flashy.

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,800
But an orange shirt.

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,719
An orange shirt with buttons and bells and black rhinestones, diamonds.

73
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:48,840
That's flashy.

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,740
Alright, flashy.

75
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,879
Flashy can also mean something that is, it's supposed to look expensive.

76
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:58,919
Okay, so that sweater was a little bit flashy according to her.

77
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,020
But also she talked about another sweater being hideous.

78
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,139
So hideous is an ugly word and it means ugly.

79
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,819
Ugly.

80
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,680
Okay, so I could say this sweater is hideous.

81
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,080
That means it's not only ugly, it's really ugly.

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,740
Okay, it's more than ugly.

83
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,579
Alright, a hideous sweater.

84
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:28,019
And moving on, the guy now was a little bit irritated and stressed out and he said, You keep yapping on about your new clothes.

85
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,319
So what is this yapping on?

86
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,240
Well yap is a sound like yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

87
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:41,779
So yapping, to yap on about, means to continue to talk and talk and talk about something.

88
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:48,300
Because he's watching the football game on TV and she's talking and talking and talking and he's annoyed.

89
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,000
So this is rude.

90
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,879
You say, stop yapping about this or stop yapping on about your game.

91
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,079
It's very rude.

92
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,180
It means just stop talking, I'm annoyed.

93
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,860
And well then he mentioned another phrase that it's pretty much the same thing, right?

94
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,360
Blabbering on.

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:10,379
To blabber, to blabber on about, means to talk about something but to not really make sense.

96
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,519
So it's just worthless talk.

97
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,560
So you're just talking to talk.

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,959
You're not really saying anything interesting.

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,980
And so sometimes we make fun of people who blabber on about things because they're not important to us or they sound stupid.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:26,860
All right.

101
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:29,560
Okay, so four key words there.

102
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:31,439
Blabbering on, yapping on.

103
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,959
Why don't we listen to them again in the dialogue?

104
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:40,379
What do you think of this one?

105
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,060
So-so.

106
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:42,920
And this one?

107
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,720
Too flashy?

108
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:45,399
Nah, not too flashy.

109
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,779
Ugh, and this sweater from my aunt.

110
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:48,680
Isn't it hideous?

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,600
I guess.

112
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:50,879
Are you even listening?

113
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

114
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,740
And I'm trying to watch the game but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

115
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,759
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

116
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,860
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

117
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,899
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

118
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,639
Ugh, your precious game.

119
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:17,300
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

120
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,100
Oh no you didn't.

121
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,120
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,019
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,079
I might just.

124
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,560
Enjoy your stupid game.

125
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:31,920
And Merry Christmas.

126
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,720
Merry Christmas.

127
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,540
Alright, we're back.

128
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,540
So now we have a couple of different phrases that we want to look at on Fluency Builder.

129
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,240
Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:52,100
Okay, so this first phrase is very closely related to the days after Christmas, especially here on Boxing Day.

131
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:59,620
We've got someone who's talking about going to the stores, to the sales, to exchange her gifts for better gifts.

132
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,439
Okay, to exchange something for something better.

133
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:06,720
This is a very common construction, it's an important phrase when talking about shopping.

134
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,259
So when we look at this construction you would say, to exchange this sweater for a better one, or for a larger one.

135
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,139
Exactly, so you can change the adjective, the word that's describing it, so you can say, to exchange these shoes for bigger ones.

136
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,220
I could also joke and I could say, I'm going to exchange my boyfriend for a better one if he's being rude to me.

137
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,980
Okay, so to exchange something for something else.

138
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:37,079
Alright, and then we saw another phrase that the husband replied to when she offended him with his football team.

139
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,399
He said, oh no you didn't.

140
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,199
Didn't what?

141
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,420
I know, didn't what?

142
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,279
No you didn't what?

143
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,500
Alright, so this, like you said, doesn't make sense alone, but some cultural context might help.

144
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:54,540
In English we often say this phrase to mean, oh no you didn't just say that.

145
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,420
Or you didn't just insult my team.

146
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,060
He's saying, I can't believe you just said that.

147
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,360
He's upset because what she said was rude or mean.

148
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:08,339
So I could say, you know Marco, I think Ecuador sucks.

149
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,220
Oh no you didn't.

150
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,259
I did just say, I don't think so actually.

151
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:15,199
It's usually a response, right?

152
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:25,079
You have to wait until somebody maybe says something mean or something that really hurts your feelings or you don't agree with when you respond to this, but you're usually very offended, right?

153
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:29,620
It's always a response to a comment that has made you angry or upset.

154
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:38,419
And our last phrase is, when they finished talking and they were fighting, she left and said, I might just.

155
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,620
Just what?

156
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,720
I know, just what?

157
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,500
See, again, these are common phrases, but they don't seem to make much sense alone.

158
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,480
I might just.

159
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,279
So let's listen to, this is a response again, this is a response to the line before it.

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,980
Why don't you just, just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until much later.

161
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,500
And she says, I might just, I might just do exactly what you just said.

162
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:06,980
Okay.

163
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:07,960
She's threatening him.

164
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,200
She's saying, I might just go out and not come back for 10 hours.

165
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,679
All right.

166
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,759
I might just do that.

167
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:13,440
Okay.

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,419
So that's a way to say what you said.

169
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,980
I might do that and I'm threatening you.

170
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,279
So again, it's usually a response, right?

171
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,559
Or a threat, as you said.

172
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,519
So I could say, Marco, why don't you just leave?

173
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,240
All right.

174
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,019
I might just.

175
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,059
Oh, what am I going to do in the studio alone?

176
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,139
All right.

177
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,700
So three interesting phrases there.

178
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,759
Why don't we listen to all the words and phrases again in our dialogue one last time.

179
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,139
What do you think of this one?

180
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,820
Eh, so-so.

181
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:51,679
And this one?

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,480
Too flashy?

183
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,159
Nah, not too flashy.

184
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,559
Oh, and this sweater from my aunt.

185
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,460
Isn't it hideous?

186
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,379
I guess.

187
00:09:58,779 --> 00:09:59,639
Are you even listening?

188
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,419
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

189
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,500
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

190
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,519
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

191
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,639
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

192
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,620
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

193
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,399
Oh, your precious game.

194
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,080
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

195
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,840
Oh, no you didn't.

196
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,899
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

197
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,799
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,340
I might just enjoy your stupid game.

199
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,700
And Merry Christmas.

200
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,500
Merry Christmas.

201
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,379
All right, we're back.

202
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,820
So Boxing Day, as you said, is usually a commonwealth thing and in the United States you don't really have it, right?

203
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:55,700
We do not.

204
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:18,080
My family, I don't know why, but my family sometimes celebrates that we have friends who come over and we have a nice Boxing Day meal, but I've been told that the tradition in commonwealth countries is to watch sporting events, local sporting events, and to go shopping for all these sales and bargains and exchange all those ugly, hideous, annoying, or bad gifts that you received at Christmas.

205
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,340
Right, so it's usually like the after-Christmas sales.

206
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,360
Exactly.

207
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:27,559
So if you have any special Boxing Day traditions, I'd be very curious to hear them.

208
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,259
Again, not a holiday related to the sport boxing.

209
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,299
It's spelled the same way and it looks the same, but they're very different now.

210
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,519
So if you have any stories or questions about the things that we talked about today, please do let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

211
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,580
All right, we'll see you guys there and until next time.

212
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,120
Bye, everyone.

213
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,779
See you next time.

214
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:52,899
Bye.
