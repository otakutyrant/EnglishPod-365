00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have another holiday lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's an intermediate level lesson, but it's not about Christmas, and it's not about New Year's.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So what's this holiday, Marco?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's like after Christmas, but before New Year's.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so let's look at this holiday in today's vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All right, so as you noticed in the title, this is called Boxing Day.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Boom, boom, boom.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So like fighting boxing.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, no, no.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Kind of like boxes, right?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's more related to boxes.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this is a holiday that we don't actually celebrate in America.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's celebrated in what are called Commonwealth countries.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That means countries that used to be a part of Great Britain or that are a part of Great Britain.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So England, Scotland, Canada, Australia.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And this is a day where, well, it's considered a holiday because it's a bank holiday.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That means all the banks close.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No one's at work.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's the day after Christmas, so it's December 26th.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And it's traditionally a day when you give money or gifts to the poor.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And so this is more or less what we're going to be talking about, but more modern, right?

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Before it was like that, but now it's kind of become this shopping thing, right?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It has.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a day when everyone goes to the sales after Christmas to return things or to buy new things.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So we're going to hear about this right away in today's dialogue.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And when we come back, we'll be talking about some of the phrases and words that you've heard.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What do you think of this one?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Eh, so-so.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And this one?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Too flashy?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Nah, not too flashy.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ugh, and this sweater from my aunt.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Isn't it hideous?

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I guess.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Are you even listening?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I'm trying to watch the game.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But you're yapping on about your new clothes.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ugh, your precious game.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You watch the same game every year, and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, no you didn't.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Why don't you just, just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I might just enjoy your stupid game.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And Merry Christmas!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Merry Christmas!

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Alright, great, so we're back and, uh, interesting, the couple fighting right after Christmas.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, I think it's very common to hear fights around the holidays.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
People are very stressed out.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And tired of dealing with family and presents and all the stress, right?

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Exactly.

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right now, why don't we take a look at four key words in Language Takeaway.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay, these first two words are words that the wife uses in talking about some of these clothes that she got as presents.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So she says, well, she asks her husband, is this too flashy?

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Flashy.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Flashy.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright, so, you know flash, like the camera flash, right?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This big light.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now flashy, when you're talking about clothes or an object, is it, it's too noticeable, right?

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's too noticeable, too bright, too loud.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So for example, a black shirt is not flashy.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But an orange shirt.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
An orange shirt with buttons and bells and black rhinestones, diamonds.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's flashy.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Alright, flashy.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Flashy can also mean something that is, it's supposed to look expensive.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, so that sweater was a little bit flashy according to her.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But also she talked about another sweater being hideous.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So hideous is an ugly word and it means ugly.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ugly.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, so I could say this sweater is hideous.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That means it's not only ugly, it's really ugly.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, it's more than ugly.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Alright, a hideous sweater.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And moving on, the guy now was a little bit irritated and stressed out and he said, You keep yapping on about your new clothes.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So what is this yapping on?

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well yap is a sound like yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So yapping, to yap on about, means to continue to talk and talk and talk about something.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because he's watching the football game on TV and she's talking and talking and talking and he's annoyed.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So this is rude.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You say, stop yapping about this or stop yapping on about your game.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's very rude.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It means just stop talking, I'm annoyed.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And well then he mentioned another phrase that it's pretty much the same thing, right?

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Blabbering on.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
To blabber, to blabber on about, means to talk about something but to not really make sense.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So it's just worthless talk.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So you're just talking to talk.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're not really saying anything interesting.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And so sometimes we make fun of people who blabber on about things because they're not important to us or they sound stupid.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All right.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay, so four key words there.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Blabbering on, yapping on.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why don't we listen to them again in the dialogue?

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you think of this one?

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So-so.

106
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And this one?

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Too flashy?

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Nah, not too flashy.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ugh, and this sweater from my aunt.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Isn't it hideous?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I guess.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Are you even listening?

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I'm trying to watch the game but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ugh, your precious game.

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh no you didn't.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I might just.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Enjoy your stupid game.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And Merry Christmas.

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Merry Christmas.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Alright, we're back.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So now we have a couple of different phrases that we want to look at on Fluency Builder.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Fluency Builder.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, so this first phrase is very closely related to the days after Christmas, especially here on Boxing Day.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We've got someone who's talking about going to the stores, to the sales, to exchange her gifts for better gifts.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, to exchange something for something better.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is a very common construction, it's an important phrase when talking about shopping.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So when we look at this construction you would say, to exchange this sweater for a better one, or for a larger one.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Exactly, so you can change the adjective, the word that's describing it, so you can say, to exchange these shoes for bigger ones.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I could also joke and I could say, I'm going to exchange my boyfriend for a better one if he's being rude to me.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay, so to exchange something for something else.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright, and then we saw another phrase that the husband replied to when she offended him with his football team.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He said, oh no you didn't.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Didn't what?

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know, didn't what?

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No you didn't what?

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Alright, so this, like you said, doesn't make sense alone, but some cultural context might help.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In English we often say this phrase to mean, oh no you didn't just say that.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Or you didn't just insult my team.

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's saying, I can't believe you just said that.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's upset because what she said was rude or mean.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So I could say, you know Marco, I think Ecuador sucks.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh no you didn't.

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I did just say, I don't think so actually.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's usually a response, right?

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You have to wait until somebody maybe says something mean or something that really hurts your feelings or you don't agree with when you respond to this, but you're usually very offended, right?

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's always a response to a comment that has made you angry or upset.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And our last phrase is, when they finished talking and they were fighting, she left and said, I might just.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Just what?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I know, just what?

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
See, again, these are common phrases, but they don't seem to make much sense alone.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I might just.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So let's listen to, this is a response again, this is a response to the line before it.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why don't you just, just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until much later.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And she says, I might just, I might just do exactly what you just said.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
She's threatening him.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She's saying, I might just go out and not come back for 10 hours.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
All right.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I might just do that.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So that's a way to say what you said.

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I might do that and I'm threatening you.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So again, it's usually a response, right?

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or a threat, as you said.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So I could say, Marco, why don't you just leave?

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I might just.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, what am I going to do in the studio alone?

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
All right.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So three interesting phrases there.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why don't we listen to all the words and phrases again in our dialogue one last time.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What do you think of this one?

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Eh, so-so.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And this one?

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Too flashy?

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Nah, not too flashy.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, and this sweater from my aunt.

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Isn't it hideous?

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I guess.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you even listening?

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And I'm trying to watch the game, but you're yapping on about your new clothes.

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Well, I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, could you do me the favor of making this quick?

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first.

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, your precious game.

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You watch the same game every year and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, no you didn't.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You didn't just insult the Salisbury Seals, did you?

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why don't you just go return all those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over?

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I might just enjoy your stupid game.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And Merry Christmas.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Merry Christmas.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right, we're back.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So Boxing Day, as you said, is usually a commonwealth thing and in the United States you don't really have it, right?

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We do not.

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:18,000
My family, I don't know why, but my family sometimes celebrates that we have friends who come over and we have a nice Boxing Day meal, but I've been told that the tradition in commonwealth countries is to watch sporting events, local sporting events, and to go shopping for all these sales and bargains and exchange all those ugly, hideous, annoying, or bad gifts that you received at Christmas.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Right, so it's usually like the after-Christmas sales.

206
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Exactly.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So if you have any special Boxing Day traditions, I'd be very curious to hear them.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Again, not a holiday related to the sport boxing.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's spelled the same way and it looks the same, but they're very different now.

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So if you have any stories or questions about the things that we talked about today, please do let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
All right, we'll see you guys there and until next time.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Bye, everyone.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
See you next time.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Bye.
