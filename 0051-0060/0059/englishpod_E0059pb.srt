00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,599
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:06,660
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,599
And today we're bringing you another great advanced lesson for all those advanced users out there.

4
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,940
That's right, this is a really, really useful lesson for all of our advanced users.

5
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:26,660
Exactly, you asked for a lesson about job interviews and well, here we are, we're bringing you the first of three parts of the job interview series.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,920
Alright, so Marco, you said it is the first of three parts, so tell me, what are these three parts?

7
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,820
Okay, in this lesson, we're going to be looking at preparing for a job interview.

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,159
Okay.

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,759
So everything you got to do before the job interview.

10
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:46,399
Part two will be talking about your education, your background, your work experience.

11
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:46,840
Okay.

12
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:51,740
And in part three, we'll take a look at some of the common questions that are asked at a job interview.

13
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,560
And so we'll talk about some great ways to answer these questions.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,880
Alright, these three lessons will be coming out over the next month or so.

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:00:59,659
Exactly.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,679
So we're going to be looking at part one today.

17
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,519
So let's take a look at some vocabulary preview.

18
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:06,760
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,540
Well, we have three words here in vocabulary preview that you'll hear in the dialogue in a moment.

20
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,879
And the first one is actually not really a word but an acronym.

21
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:18,060
CRM.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,959
CRM.

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:19,920
CRM.

24
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:22,319
So Marco, you are our marketing guy.

25
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,000
Tell us what is a CRM?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,659
Well, it's really common in marketing.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,719
It stands for customer relationship management.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,140
Okay.

29
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,980
Or customer relation management.

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,019
But basically it's the relationship that the company has with its customers.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,599
So CRM basically has parts like feedback or customer support problems that they might have and also information about habits and likes and dislikes from their customers or users.

32
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,920
But I commonly hear this word used as a noun.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,680
So something like, can you check in the CRM?

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,219
Right.

36
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,359
There is some software out there that's called the CRM.

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,680
So Sugar CRM or many different softwares which basically manages your database of customers.

38
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,099
Basically software that englobes this whole thing.

39
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,080
Got it.

40
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,259
Right.

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,020
Our next phrase in vocabulary preview.

42
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Custom designed.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,800
Custom designed.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,819
Custom designed.

45
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,460
Custom designed.

46
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,360
So when something is custom designed.

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,219
It means it's a special design just for you.

48
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:21,919
So it's unique.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
That's what the word custom means.

50
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:24,740
Unique.

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,759
Like made especially for one person.

52
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,639
So you have custom designed or also custom made.

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,580
You see that a lot for example in cars, right?

54
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,879
A custom made car.

55
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:36,199
Yes.

56
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,000
Or maybe a custom built house.

57
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:39,139
A custom built house.

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,659
With your specific likes and dislikes.

59
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:41,800
Yeah.

60
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,680
Your requirements.

61
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,080
Okay.

62
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,360
And our last word.

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,919
Core values.

64
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,020
Core values.

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,659
Core values.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,479
Core values.

67
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,300
So the core values of a company.

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,939
What does the core mean actually?

69
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,719
The center.

70
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,780
The center, right?

71
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,319
So and here I think it's like the center or the most important.

72
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,039
The most important things the company believes in, right?

73
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,340
Right.

74
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,939
So maybe respect for the environment.

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,680
Okay.

76
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,680
Or developing their employees.

77
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:09,539
Okay.

78
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,740
So the core values.

79
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,120
The main things that the company believes in.

81
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,139
A great phrase for job interviews.

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:15,979
Oh yes.

83
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,860
Very good phrase.

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,419
Okay.

85
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,960
So why don't we listen to a dialogue.

86
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,520
Erica, what exactly is happening?

87
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:21,080
All right.

88
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:27,539
We're going to be listening to two friends and this guy is getting ready to go on a job interview.

89
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,939
So his friend is helping him to prepare.

90
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:39,659
Okay.

91
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,419
So let's go over everything one more time.

92
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,219
I really want you to get this job.

93
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:44,780
I know.

94
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,539
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

95
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:54,139
They're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

96
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
So let's see.

97
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,719
You did your research on the company, right?

98
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,919
Well, I visited the website and read up on what they do.

99
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,960
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations.

100
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:11,319
They provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom designed applications.

101
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,539
So what would be your role in the company?

102
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,720
Well, the position is for an account manager.

103
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,120
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

104
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,360
Sounds good.

105
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,540
And so why do you want to work with them?

106
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,740
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,759
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

108
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,480
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

109
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,480
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

110
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,439
Oh, and they offer six weeks vacation, stock options, and bonuses.

111
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,240
I'm totally going to cash in on that.

112
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:52,379
You idiot.

113
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,680
You don't say that.

114
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,259
Do you want this job or not?

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,500
All right.

116
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,420
So he was doing great, but in the end, he said something he shouldn't, right?

117
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:05,699
Yeah.

118
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,699
I don't think talking about money as your primary motivation for coming onto a new company is really the way to go.

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,360
Yeah.

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,779
And we're going to talk about that a little bit later, but let's take a look real quick at some language takeaway.

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,759
Language takeaway.

122
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:22,480
All right.

123
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:28,199
In this lesson, we have five keywords for you from the dialogue, which we hope that you will remember.

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,839
Let's take a look at the first one.

125
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,019
Undisputed.

126
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:33,459
Undisputed.

127
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,019
Undisputed.

128
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:35,680
Undisputed.

129
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,019
So this is kind of a strange word.

130
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,819
Let's listen to some examples before we explain it.

131
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Example one.

132
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,439
It's undisputed that she's the best person for the job.

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,639
Example two.

134
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,259
The undisputed truth is that unemployment is rising.

135
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,600
No one doubts that.

136
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,660
Example three.

137
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,759
Is the undisputed champion of the world.

138
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,779
Well, I can understand from these examples that it means there is no doubt.

139
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:18,879
There is no doubt.

140
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,920
There's no question.

141
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,439
Okay.

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,399
Now, let's take a look at our second word.

143
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,879
Growth opportunity.

144
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,060
Growth opportunity.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,079
It's a great growth opportunity.

146
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,139
So it's an excellent chance to improve, right?

147
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:33,560
To improve.

148
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,259
Professionally and also on a personal side, right?

149
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,600
So talking about growth opportunities, we can also use the phrase a development opportunity.

150
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:44,000
And it's the same thing, right?

151
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,300
To develop, to grow.

152
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,899
To improve yourself.

153
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:47,699
Okay.

154
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,279
Now, let's take a look at our third word.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,319
Read up.

156
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,600
Read up.

157
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,819
Read up.

158
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,759
Read up.

159
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,480
So when you read up on something.

160
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,100
Well, obviously you read it, right?

161
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,399
Right.

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,019
But you're reading it specifically for some information.

163
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,019
So you can know more about the subject.

164
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,579
So it's kind of similar to study, right?

165
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,279
Kind of.

166
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:12,600
But really with the idea that you're trying to improve your knowledge about a particular field.

167
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,360
Okay.

168
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
Now for our fourth word.

169
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:16,120
Unleash potential.

170
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,360
Unleash potential.

171
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,040
Unleash potential.

172
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,139
Unleash potential.

173
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:20,879
Okay.

174
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,079
So to unleash.

175
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:22,779
All right.

176
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,720
Well, I'm going to paint a picture for you.

177
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,240
All right.

178
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,399
So imagine you have your dog, right?

179
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,879
And your dog is walking on a leash.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,079
It has a string or a rope attached to it.

181
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,300
All right.

182
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,399
So then when you undo the leash, you unleash the dog.

183
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,060
And then what happens?

184
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,420
It goes around and it's running.

185
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:38,040
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,740
It's going everywhere.

187
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,220
Uh-huh.

188
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:45,100
So if you unleash potential, you release it and let it go and help it grow and become bigger.

189
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:46,800
So you give it freedom.

190
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,680
Uh-huh.

191
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,000
So potential is the capabilities or abilities that a person has, right?

192
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,220
Yes.

193
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,160
To do something great.

194
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:53,639
Mm-hmm.

195
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,319
Okay.

196
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,480
Unleash potential.

197
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,379
This I think is an excellent word to use in a job interview.

198
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,399
I think it is really descriptive and really powerful.

199
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,139
Yeah, it is.

200
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:03,339
Yeah.

201
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:04,100
That's a good word.

202
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,000
Uh, okay.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,060
So let's take a look at our last one now.

204
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:08,600
Resonate with.

205
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,139
Resonate with.

206
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,879
Resonate with.

207
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:12,800
Resonate with.

208
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,000
So he mentioned this really resonated with me.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
So what does he mean by resonated?

210
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,319
I guess he means it connected to him, right?

211
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,259
It touched him.

212
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,319
So he agrees with this idea or he feels that he can relate to it.

213
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,439
Yeah, exactly.

214
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:28,939
You know what?

215
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,480
I think this one needs a few examples to really show its meaning.

216
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,770
Okay, let's listen.

217
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,600
Example one.

218
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,559
The candidate's speech really resonated with the voters.

219
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,539
Example two.

220
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,419
Their music doesn't really resonate with me.

221
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:03,779
Example three.

222
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,259
Their commitment to fight global warming resonates with me.

223
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:16,539
All right.

224
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,259
So it's clear now to resonate with, right?

225
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:19,899
Mm-hmm.

226
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:19,960
Okay.

227
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:27,139
Okay, so why don't we go and listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and give you some great pointers about preparing for a job interview.

228
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,299
Okay, so let's go over everything one more time.

229
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,100
I really want you to get this job.

230
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:44,659
I know.

231
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:46,419
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

232
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:54,019
They're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

233
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
So, let's see.

234
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,620
You did your research on the company, right?

235
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,799
Well, I visited the website and read up on what they do.

236
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,840
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations.

237
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:11,200
They provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom-designed applications.

238
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:14,419
So, what would be your role in the company?

239
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:17,600
Well, the position is for an account manager.

240
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,019
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

241
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,240
Sounds good.

242
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,399
And so, why do you want to work with them?

243
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,600
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

244
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,620
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

245
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,379
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

246
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,279
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

247
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,340
Oh, and they offer six-week vacation, stock options, and bonuses.

248
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,080
I'm totally going to cash in on that.

249
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:52,279
You idiot.

250
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,559
You don't say that.

251
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,159
Do you want this job or not?

252
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,679
Okay, so preparing for a job interview is really important, right?

253
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:06,460
Yeah.

254
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,100
And we're going to give you some really basic tips about how you can prepare for a job interview.

255
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,980
Yeah, I've got to confess something to you, Marco.

256
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:13,480
What?

257
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,759
I love job interviews.

258
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:16,320
Really?

259
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:16,919
Yeah, I know.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,720
It's really weird.

261
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,580
Most people hate them, but I love them.

262
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,799
So you love being the interviewer or going to job interviews?

263
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,500
Really?

264
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:23,779
Yeah.

265
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,240
I like everything about them.

266
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,279
So I feel like I have a lot of passion to share with you about this.

267
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:29,919
All right.

268
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:34,340
So let's take a look at the first point or the first tip that you can help us out with.

269
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,059
So before you go to a job interview, you should do a little bit of research, right?

270
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:38,360
Right.

271
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,399
And that's our first point.

272
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:51,460
It's really important to know as much as you can about the company, their history, their product, their management style, just as much information as you can find out about how they work and what they do.

273
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,019
And why do you think this is important?

274
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,259
Well, basically, you'll be asked about it in the interview.

275
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,919
And so if you show that you haven't prepared, you haven't done any research, you show that you don't care.

276
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:11,820
One of the best ways that you can impress in a job interview is to show that you know about the company, important things like you know what kind of products they offer or what's their largest market.

277
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,139
Yeah.

278
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,519
And I guess that really impresses the interviewer because it shows that you are interested in this company and they really want the job.

279
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,679
And that you are willing to do the extra work it takes to prepare yourself.

280
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:27,860
Because I think that will show the interviewer that later on when you're working for them, you'll do that extra work on the job.

281
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,519
Exactly.

282
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,960
That's a really good point.

283
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,480
So that's our first point, our first tip to do some research.

284
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:33,899
Yes.

285
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,600
Now, you've done your research.

286
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
You know everything about the company.

287
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:37,960
What else should you do?

288
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,820
Once you've read up on the company, you've got to spend some time thinking about yourself.

289
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,279
You've got to prepare to sell yourself to the company.

290
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:51,340
So to sell yourself to really demonstrate them why you are the perfect person for the job.

291
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:51,679
Right.

292
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,600
Because a lot of people think about why they want to work for the company, right?

293
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:03,120
Because they feel like they're aligned with the core values or the message of the company resonates with them.

294
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,539
But what the interviewer really wants to hear is how you, the interviewee, is going to benefit the company.

295
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,759
What are you going to bring to the company?

296
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,659
And this is the most important part is to know what are your skills, right?

297
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

298
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,879
And it's not enough to just say, well, I am a great leader, right?

299
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:26,799
So if you are a great leader, you should be ready to give an example of how you have demonstrated to be a great leader.

300
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,159
Yes.

301
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:27,820
All right.

302
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,240
So maybe like an example, like I'm a really strong leader because in my previous job, I had the best J.D.

303
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,419
Power ratings for employee satisfaction.

304
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:37,899
Okay.

305
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:43,460
So you are actually showing with numbers or with facts that you are a great leader.

306
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,100
So the key thing here, I think, is identify what your strengths and skills are.

307
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:49,919
Think of specific examples.

308
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:58,480
If you can, give numbers and show how you can bring this skill and your experiences to the new company.

309
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,419
And now, well, you're ready to sell yourself, you've done your research.

310
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,559
Now, you have all of these things in your mind.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You have to practice.

312
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:07,399
Yes.

313
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:07,960
Right?

314
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,879
And a much overlooked stage in the preparation.

315
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,299
Yeah.

316
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,919
A lot of people think it through, they write things down, but don't really practice.

317
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:16,600
Yeah.

318
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,159
So I know you have a few tips about how you can practice interviewing effectively.

319
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,100
Okay.

320
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:24,580
Well, the first thing that you should do is use your friends.

321
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:25,039
Yeah.

322
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,460
They've got to be good for something.

323
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,919
And well, probably your friends are also working at a company, maybe they're managers, or maybe they've interviewed someone before already.

324
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,220
So you can set up a mini interview and have them pretend that they are the interviewer.

325
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,519
And ask you these questions, and you're trying to answer seriously.

326
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:46,539
And I'm sure that your friends can give you some great feedback, maybe what you did right, maybe what you did wrong.

327
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,360
So that's a really good way.

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,139
And another thing is also you can record yourself.

329
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:51,799
Yes.

330
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,399
Right?

331
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:52,779
Yeah.

332
00:14:52,779 --> 00:15:02,019
If you have a video camera, or even a web, I mean many people have a webcam like right in your laptop, record yourself actually doing the practice interview with your friend.

333
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:09,759
And this is really useful because you can later see what you recorded, and detect some of the things that maybe aren't really useful or good.

334
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,200
You know, for example, posture is a really important aspect.

335
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,120
So what do you mean posture?

336
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,220
So the way that you are sitting down in your seat, and how you are expressing yourself with your hands.

337
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,799
Some people, you know, they move a lot during the interview, because of course you're nervous.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,620
So maybe they're moving from side to side, or playing with their feet, or playing with something on the table, or moving their hands in an awkward way.

339
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,679
So those are the things that you have to watch out for.

340
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,019
Yes.

341
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,799
So I guess it's really important to sit up straight and to show that you are powerful and in control.

342
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,799
And another really great thing is eye contact, right?

343
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,740
Yeah, yeah, we were talking about this earlier.

344
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,039
And why is eye contact so important?

345
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:54,340
If an interviewee maintains eye contact with me for like most of the interview, I feel like they have really good people skills.

346
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,500
In my opinion, I would say they have a lot of self-confidence.

347
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,360
Yeah, I'd agree.

348
00:15:59,639 --> 00:15:59,720
Right?

349
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:05,220
Because if a person is looking down or not looking directly at you, it's either one of two things in my opinion.

350
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,039
It's either they are not confident enough with themselves, or they are lying to you.

351
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:10,480
Yes.

352
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:10,980
Right?

353
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:11,360
Yeah.

354
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,220
Or also they just don't have good people skills.

355
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,539
Yeah.

356
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:18,120
Which is a problem in today's sort of knowledge-based economy.

357
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,679
So it's really important to maintain eye contact.

358
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:26,539
And one other really important thing related to eye contact posture is the handshake.

359
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,039
When you get to the interview, it's really, really important to give a firm, good handshake.

360
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:34,980
So what qualifies as a firm, good handshake?

361
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:38,500
Well, you don't have to prove that you are ultra strong, right?

362
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,179
You don't have to squeeze the other person's hand really hard.

363
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,320
And like break their hand.

364
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:42,840
Exactly.

365
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,840
It's not like a strength contest.

366
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:45,179
No.

367
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,679
A good firm handshake is squeezing normally, not too tight, not too loose.

368
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:55,980
But your entire palm, your entire hand has to be in contact with the other person's palm or hand.

369
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,340
Yes.

370
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,820
Don't give them the fingers.

371
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,639
You know, like some people give you only four fingers or half their hand.

372
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,740
Yeah, I hate that.

373
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,620
I hate it too.

374
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:07,339
And this goes for men and for women because a lot of women do this.

375
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:07,619
Yep.

376
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,740
I call this the dead fish handshake.

377
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,940
It is kind of like a dead fish or the dead hand handshake.

378
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,359
Yeah, I absolutely agree with you on this one.

379
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,960
So nice firm handshake.

380
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,460
Yeah.

381
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,680
Firm handshake.

382
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,920
And well, these are our tips for preparing for the interview.

383
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,460
Everything you have to do before it.

384
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,839

385
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,440

386
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,880
Yeah, I'd love to hear it because like I told you, I love job interviews.

387
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,519
