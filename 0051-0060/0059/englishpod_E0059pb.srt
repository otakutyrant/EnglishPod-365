00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're bringing you another great advanced lesson for all those advanced users out there.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right, this is a really, really useful lesson for all of our advanced users.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Exactly, you asked for a lesson about job interviews and well, here we are, we're bringing you the first of three parts of the job interview series.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Alright, so Marco, you said it is the first of three parts, so tell me, what are these three parts?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, in this lesson, we're going to be looking at preparing for a job interview.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So everything you got to do before the job interview.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Part two will be talking about your education, your background, your work experience.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And in part three, we'll take a look at some of the common questions that are asked at a job interview.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And so we'll talk about some great ways to answer these questions.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Alright, these three lessons will be coming out over the next month or so.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Exactly.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So we're going to be looking at part one today.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So let's take a look at some vocabulary preview.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, we have three words here in vocabulary preview that you'll hear in the dialogue in a moment.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And the first one is actually not really a word but an acronym.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
CRM.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
CRM.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
CRM.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So Marco, you are our marketing guy.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Tell us what is a CRM?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, it's really common in marketing.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It stands for customer relationship management.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or customer relation management.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But basically it's the relationship that the company has with its customers.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So CRM basically has parts like feedback or customer support problems that they might have and also information about habits and likes and dislikes from their customers or users.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But I commonly hear this word used as a noun.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So something like, can you check in the CRM?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Right.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There is some software out there that's called the CRM.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So Sugar CRM or many different softwares which basically manages your database of customers.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Basically software that englobes this whole thing.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Got it.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Our next phrase in vocabulary preview.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Custom designed.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Custom designed.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Custom designed.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Custom designed.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So when something is custom designed.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It means it's a special design just for you.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So it's unique.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's what the word custom means.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Unique.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Like made especially for one person.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you have custom designed or also custom made.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You see that a lot for example in cars, right?

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A custom made car.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Or maybe a custom built house.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A custom built house.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
With your specific likes and dislikes.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your requirements.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And our last word.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Core values.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Core values.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Core values.

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Core values.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So the core values of a company.

68
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What does the core mean actually?

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The center.

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The center, right?

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So and here I think it's like the center or the most important.

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The most important things the company believes in, right?

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Right.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So maybe respect for the environment.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Or developing their employees.

77
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So the core values.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The main things that the company believes in.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
A great phrase for job interviews.

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh yes.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Very good phrase.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So why don't we listen to a dialogue.

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Erica, what exactly is happening?

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
All right.

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're going to be listening to two friends and this guy is getting ready to go on a job interview.

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So his friend is helping him to prepare.

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So let's go over everything one more time.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I really want you to get this job.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I know.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So let's see.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You did your research on the company, right?

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, I visited the website and read up on what they do.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom designed applications.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So what would be your role in the company?

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, the position is for an account manager.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sounds good.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And so why do you want to work with them?

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, and they offer six weeks vacation, stock options, and bonuses.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm totally going to cash in on that.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You idiot.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You don't say that.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you want this job or not?

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right.

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So he was doing great, but in the end, he said something he shouldn't, right?

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't think talking about money as your primary motivation for coming onto a new company is really the way to go.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And we're going to talk about that a little bit later, but let's take a look real quick at some language takeaway.

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Language takeaway.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
All right.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In this lesson, we have five keywords for you from the dialogue, which we hope that you will remember.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's take a look at the first one.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Undisputed.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Undisputed.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Undisputed.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Undisputed.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So this is kind of a strange word.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's listen to some examples before we explain it.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Example one.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's undisputed that she's the best person for the job.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Example two.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The undisputed truth is that unemployment is rising.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No one doubts that.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Example three.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is the undisputed champion of the world.

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, I can understand from these examples that it means there is no doubt.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There is no doubt.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There's no question.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now, let's take a look at our second word.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Growth opportunity.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Growth opportunity.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a great growth opportunity.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So it's an excellent chance to improve, right?

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To improve.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Professionally and also on a personal side, right?

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So talking about growth opportunities, we can also use the phrase a development opportunity.

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And it's the same thing, right?

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
To develop, to grow.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
To improve yourself.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now, let's take a look at our third word.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Read up.

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Read up.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Read up.

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Read up.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So when you read up on something.

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, obviously you read it, right?

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Right.

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But you're reading it specifically for some information.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you can know more about the subject.

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So it's kind of similar to study, right?

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Kind of.

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But really with the idea that you're trying to improve your knowledge about a particular field.

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now for our fourth word.

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Unleash potential.

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Unleash potential.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Unleash potential.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Unleash potential.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay.

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So to unleash.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right.

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, I'm going to paint a picture for you.

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So imagine you have your dog, right?

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And your dog is walking on a leash.

180
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It has a string or a rope attached to it.

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All right.

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So then when you undo the leash, you unleash the dog.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then what happens?

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It goes around and it's running.

185
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, yeah.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's going everywhere.

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uh-huh.

188
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So if you unleash potential, you release it and let it go and help it grow and become bigger.

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So you give it freedom.

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Uh-huh.

191
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So potential is the capabilities or abilities that a person has, right?

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
To do something great.

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Mm-hmm.

195
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

196
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Unleash potential.

197
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This I think is an excellent word to use in a job interview.

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think it is really descriptive and really powerful.

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, it is.

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah.

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's a good word.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Uh, okay.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So let's take a look at our last one now.

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Resonate with.

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Resonate with.

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Resonate with.

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Resonate with.

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So he mentioned this really resonated with me.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So what does he mean by resonated?

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I guess he means it connected to him, right?

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It touched him.

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So he agrees with this idea or he feels that he can relate to it.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You know what?

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think this one needs a few examples to really show its meaning.

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, let's listen.

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Example one.

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The candidate's speech really resonated with the voters.

219
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Example two.

220
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Their music doesn't really resonate with me.

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Example three.

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Their commitment to fight global warming resonates with me.

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All right.

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So it's clear now to resonate with, right?

225
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Mm-hmm.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, so why don't we go and listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and give you some great pointers about preparing for a job interview.

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, so let's go over everything one more time.

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I really want you to get this job.

230
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know.

231
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's an amazing growth opportunity.

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, let's see.

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You did your research on the company, right?

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, I visited the website and read up on what they do.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom-designed applications.

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, what would be your role in the company?

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, the position is for an account manager.

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team.

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sounds good.

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And so, why do you want to work with them?

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, as I said, they're the industry leaders.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance.

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential.

246
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, and they offer six-week vacation, stock options, and bonuses.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm totally going to cash in on that.

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You idiot.

250
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't say that.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you want this job or not?

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay, so preparing for a job interview is really important, right?

253
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And we're going to give you some really basic tips about how you can prepare for a job interview.

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, I've got to confess something to you, Marco.

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I love job interviews.

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Really?

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, I know.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's really weird.

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Most people hate them, but I love them.

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So you love being the interviewer or going to job interviews?

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really?

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I like everything about them.

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So I feel like I have a lot of passion to share with you about this.

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right.

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So let's take a look at the first point or the first tip that you can help us out with.

269
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So before you go to a job interview, you should do a little bit of research, right?

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Right.

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And that's our first point.

272
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's really important to know as much as you can about the company, their history, their product, their management style, just as much information as you can find out about how they work and what they do.

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And why do you think this is important?

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, basically, you'll be asked about it in the interview.

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And so if you show that you haven't prepared, you haven't done any research, you show that you don't care.

276
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
One of the best ways that you can impress in a job interview is to show that you know about the company, important things like you know what kind of products they offer or what's their largest market.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah.

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And I guess that really impresses the interviewer because it shows that you are interested in this company and they really want the job.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And that you are willing to do the extra work it takes to prepare yourself.

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Because I think that will show the interviewer that later on when you're working for them, you'll do that extra work on the job.

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Exactly.

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's a really good point.

283
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So that's our first point, our first tip to do some research.

284
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes.

285
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Now, you've done your research.

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You know everything about the company.

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What else should you do?

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Once you've read up on the company, you've got to spend some time thinking about yourself.

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You've got to prepare to sell yourself to the company.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So to sell yourself to really demonstrate them why you are the perfect person for the job.

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Right.

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because a lot of people think about why they want to work for the company, right?

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because they feel like they're aligned with the core values or the message of the company resonates with them.

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But what the interviewer really wants to hear is how you, the interviewee, is going to benefit the company.

295
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What are you going to bring to the company?

296
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And this is the most important part is to know what are your skills, right?

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And it's not enough to just say, well, I am a great leader, right?

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So if you are a great leader, you should be ready to give an example of how you have demonstrated to be a great leader.

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes.

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
All right.

302
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So maybe like an example, like I'm a really strong leader because in my previous job, I had the best J.D.

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Power ratings for employee satisfaction.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Okay.

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So you are actually showing with numbers or with facts that you are a great leader.

306
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So the key thing here, I think, is identify what your strengths and skills are.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Think of specific examples.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
If you can, give numbers and show how you can bring this skill and your experiences to the new company.

309
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And now, well, you're ready to sell yourself, you've done your research.

310
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now, you have all of these things in your mind.

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You have to practice.

312
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Right?

314
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And a much overlooked stage in the preparation.

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
A lot of people think it through, they write things down, but don't really practice.

317
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah.

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So I know you have a few tips about how you can practice interviewing effectively.

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay.

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well, the first thing that you should do is use your friends.

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah.

322
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They've got to be good for something.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And well, probably your friends are also working at a company, maybe they're managers, or maybe they've interviewed someone before already.

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So you can set up a mini interview and have them pretend that they are the interviewer.

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And ask you these questions, and you're trying to answer seriously.

326
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And I'm sure that your friends can give you some great feedback, maybe what you did right, maybe what you did wrong.

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So that's a really good way.

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And another thing is also you can record yourself.

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes.

330
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Right?

331
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you have a video camera, or even a web, I mean many people have a webcam like right in your laptop, record yourself actually doing the practice interview with your friend.

333
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And this is really useful because you can later see what you recorded, and detect some of the things that maybe aren't really useful or good.

334
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know, for example, posture is a really important aspect.

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So what do you mean posture?

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So the way that you are sitting down in your seat, and how you are expressing yourself with your hands.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Some people, you know, they move a lot during the interview, because of course you're nervous.

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So maybe they're moving from side to side, or playing with their feet, or playing with something on the table, or moving their hands in an awkward way.

339
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
So those are the things that you have to watch out for.

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So I guess it's really important to sit up straight and to show that you are powerful and in control.

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And another really great thing is eye contact, right?

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah, yeah, we were talking about this earlier.

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And why is eye contact so important?

345
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If an interviewee maintains eye contact with me for like most of the interview, I feel like they have really good people skills.

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
In my opinion, I would say they have a lot of self-confidence.

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yeah, I'd agree.

348
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Right?

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Because if a person is looking down or not looking directly at you, it's either one of two things in my opinion.

350
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's either they are not confident enough with themselves, or they are lying to you.

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes.

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Right?

353
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah.

354
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Or also they just don't have good people skills.

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah.

356
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Which is a problem in today's sort of knowledge-based economy.

357
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So it's really important to maintain eye contact.

358
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And one other really important thing related to eye contact posture is the handshake.

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
When you get to the interview, it's really, really important to give a firm, good handshake.

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So what qualifies as a firm, good handshake?

361
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, you don't have to prove that you are ultra strong, right?

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You don't have to squeeze the other person's hand really hard.

363
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And like break their hand.

364
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Exactly.

365
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's not like a strength contest.

366
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No.

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
A good firm handshake is squeezing normally, not too tight, not too loose.

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But your entire palm, your entire hand has to be in contact with the other person's palm or hand.

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes.

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't give them the fingers.

371
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You know, like some people give you only four fingers or half their hand.

372
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, I hate that.

373
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I hate it too.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And this goes for men and for women because a lot of women do this.

375
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yep.

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I call this the dead fish handshake.

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It is kind of like a dead fish or the dead hand handshake.

378
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah, I absolutely agree with you on this one.

379
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So nice firm handshake.

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yeah.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Firm handshake.

382
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And well, these are our tips for preparing for the interview.

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Everything you have to do before it.

384
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, I'd love to hear it because like I told you, I love job interviews.

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,000
