EnglishPod.com Good evening, Pizza House.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is Marty speaking.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
May I take your order?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have a 2 for 1 special on large pizzas.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Would you like a large pizza instead?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sure, that sounds good.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Great!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Oh, and make it thin crust.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, thin crust.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Perfect.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Bye.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Sir, wait!

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I need your address!
