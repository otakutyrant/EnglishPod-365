EnglishPod.com Good evening, Pizza House.

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,220
This is Marty speaking.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,539
May I take your order?

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,879
Yes, I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,199
We have a 2 for 1 special on large pizzas.

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,219
Would you like a large pizza instead?

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,699
Sure, that sounds good.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,679
Great!

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,160
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,780
No, make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

11
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:34,079
Oh, and make it thin crust.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,140
Okay, thin crust.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,380
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,579
Perfect.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,500
Thank you.

16
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:42,700
Bye.

17
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,640
Sir, wait!

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,700
I need your address!
