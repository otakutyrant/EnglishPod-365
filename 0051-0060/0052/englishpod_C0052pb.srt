00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:02,640
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,099
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,360
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,919
We're bringing you a great elementary podcast today.

6
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,640
That's right.

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,179
And we're going to be teaching you how to order pizza.

8
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:13,839
Yeah.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,660
You know, pizza is one of my favorite foods and the favorite food of many people.

10
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:19,559
Exactly.

11
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,059
It's one of those common foods that you're at home and you want to order something to eat.

12
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,320
And the typical thing is pizza.

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,780
Yeah.

14
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,600
But, you know, there's some very special language that you've got to use.

15
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:34,780
You've got to know this language when you want to order a pizza.

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,759
Exactly.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,140
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time as a man is ordering pizza.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,979
Good evening, Pizza House.

19
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,380
This is Marty speaking.

20
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,719
May I take your order?

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,060
Um, yes.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,039
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives and extra cheese.

23
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,359
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

24
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,260
Would you like a large pizza instead?

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,140
Sure.

26
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:06,819
That sounds good.

27
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:07,799
Great.

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,299
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:11,959
No.

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,939
Make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers.

31
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,239
Oh, and make it thin crust.

32
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:17,200
Okay.

33
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,280
Thin crust.

34
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,519
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

35
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:23,760
Perfect.

36
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:24,640
Thank you.

37
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:24,859
Bye.

38
00:01:24,859 --> 00:01:25,799
Sir, wait.

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,799
I need your address.

40
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:31,379
Okay.

41
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,299
So I guess he's not getting his pizza.

42
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,280
No, he forgot to give his address.

43
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,780
That's a bit of a problem.

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:37,939
Okay.

45
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,219
Let's take a look at some of the vocabulary in language takeaway.

46
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,420
All right.

47
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,319
We've got some great pizza words for you today.

48
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,379
And the first one we have is a medium pizza.

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Medium pizza.

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,480
Medium pizza.

51
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,299
So that's the size, right?

52
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:58,120
Medium.

53
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,819
You can say medium or...

54
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:01,140
12 inch.

55
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:01,840
12 inch.

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,140
Usually a medium pizza is 12 inches.

57
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,379
Yeah.

58
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,319
So you could say, I'd like a 12 inch pizza.

59
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,199
Okay.

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,659
For those of us who use centimeters, this would be more or less 30 centimeters.

61
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,379
All right.

62
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's take a look at the next size.

63
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,060
A large pizza.

64
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:18,919
Large pizza.

65
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,460
A large pizza.

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,379
So it might also be called an 18 inch.

67
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,419
An 18 inch pizza.

68
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,599
Or isn't it sometimes called a family size?

69
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,219
Family size.

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,360
I guess it depends where you're ordering.

71
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Yeah.

72
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,780
Okay.

73
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,159
So large and medium pizzas.

74
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,580
Now let's take a look at some of the ingredients.

75
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,120
Yes.

76
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:38,840
Okay.

77
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,840
We have pepperoni.

78
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:40,659
Pepperoni.

79
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,419
Pepperoni.

80
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,039
Pepperoni.

81
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,259
This is the common ingredient in all pizza.

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,020
It's my favorite.

83
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:48,139
A pizza is not a pizza unless it has pepperoni.

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,460
Okay.

85
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,120
So pepperoni is a sausage, right?

86
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,360
Yeah.

87
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,419
It's a little bit spicy.

88
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:54,659
A little bit spicy.

89
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,879
And they look like a...

90
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,319
Like circles.

91
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,199
Red circles.

92
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:57,580
Yep.

93
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:58,300
Okay.

94
00:02:59,139 --> 00:02:59,360
Olives.

95
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:00,360
Olives.

96
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,379
Olives.

97
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:02,120
Olives.

98
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,300
Olives are little black or green balls.

99
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:06,759
Yes.

100
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,340
Little green or black balls.

101
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,439
You can also find them in a martini.

102
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,479
Yeah, exactly.

103
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:11,840
Yep.

104
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,960
It's very common for them to have...

105
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
It's very common to have an...

106
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,159
It's very common to have an olive in a martini.

107
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:18,479
Yes.

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,199
Okay.

109
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,860
And he also ordered extra cheese.

110
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,819
Extra cheese.

111
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:24,419
So that means more cheese.

112
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:25,379
Extra.

113
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:25,860
All right.

114
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,400
Another ingredient.

115
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:28,439
Ham.

116
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:29,000
Ham.

117
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,560
Ham.

118
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,039
The meat of a pig.

119
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,819
Yeah.

120
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,240
Ham.

121
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,620
Yep.

122
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,080
Okay.

123
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,120
And he also ordered another strange ingredient for a pizza.

124
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,080
Pineapple.

125
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,759
Pineapple.

126
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,000
Pineapple.

127
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,520
Pineapple.

128
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:40,379
Now this is a fruit.

129
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,740
I know.

130
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,539
So weird to put pineapple on a pizza.

131
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,039
Many people like pineapple on their pizza.

132
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,780
It's a tropical fruit.

133
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,159
Yep.

134
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,479
Comes from Hawaii.

135
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,020
Usually.

136
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,560
And it kind of looks like a little palm tree at the top.

137
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:53,699
Yeah.

138
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,840
The top of a pineapple looks like a tree.

139
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,800
So pineapple.

140
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,139
Yep.

141
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,120
All right.

142
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,479
Now the last description of a pizza.

143
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,819
He ordered it with thin crust.

144
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:05,960
Thin crust.

145
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,460
Thin crust.

146
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,280
Thin crust.

147
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,659
Now we know thin is...

148
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:10,879
Skinny.

149
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:11,479
Skinny.

150
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,080
But crust.

151
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,719
What is crust?

152
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,560
It's the bread part of the pizza.

153
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,519
The outside part.

154
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:16,800
Yep.

155
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:17,519
Okay.

156
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,379
So that's the crust.

157
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,819
That's my favorite part of the pizza.

158
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:19,959
Really?

159
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,480
Yeah.

160
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,819
Thin crust or thick crust?

161
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,339
Thin crust.

162
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,100
Yeah.

163
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:26,899
Thin crust.

164
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,980
And I really love that bread part.

165
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,660
It's so important to a good pizza.

166
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,160
Okay.

167
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,139
Well, you know, they also have the crust filled with cheese.

168
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:37,639
I know.

169
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,560
It's so wrong.

170
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,600
That's good too.

171
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,180
No.

172
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:41,779
All right.

173
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,740
Let's listen to our dialogue again.

174
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,040
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

175
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,819
Good evening.

176
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,360
Pizza house.

177
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,439
This is Marty speaking.

178
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,360
May I take your order?

179
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,199
Um, yes.

180
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,279
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

181
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,579
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

182
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,019
Would you like a large pizza instead?

183
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,180
Sure.

184
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,100
That sounds good.

185
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,100
Great.

186
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,540
Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?

187
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:17,560
No.

188
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,279
Make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

189
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,920
Oh, and make it thin crust.

190
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:23,839
Okay.

191
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:24,800
Thin crust.

192
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,399
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

193
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:31,699
Perfect.

194
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,720
Thank you.

195
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,300
Bye.

196
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,040
Sir.

197
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:34,779
Wait.

198
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,360
I need your address.

199
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,420
Okay.

200
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:44,259
Now we have some really polite language that you could use possibly with customers or with clients.

201
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,699
Yep.

202
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:45,180
Okay.

203
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,259
So let's take a look at them in fluency builder.

204
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,120
Fluency builder.

205
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,860
Okay.

206
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:50,699
My, all right.

207
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,899
The first phrase we have, um, I think is my favorite.

208
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,360
Uh, this is the way that Marty answered the phone, right?

209
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,019
He said, this is Marty speaking.

210
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,899
This is Marty speaking.

211
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,480
This is Marty speaking.

212
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,720
Now, why is this so important?

213
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,100
Cause a lot of people when they answer the phone say, I'm Erica.

214
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,660
Like, hello, I'm Erica, which is not what English people say.

215
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,040
We always say Erica speaking.

216
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,740
This is Erica speaking.

217
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,180
Exactly.

218
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,360
So guys remember this, you'll sound really, really great when you use this on the phone.

219
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,060
This is Marty speaking.

220
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:26,279
Exactly.

221
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,120
This is Marty.

222
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,060
Well, don't use Marty.

223
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,680
Use your name.

224
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,139
All right.

225
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,920
And you also mentioned a two for one special.

226
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,199
Two for one special.

227
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,519
A two for one special.

228
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,279
So that means you're getting two pizzas, right?

229
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,579
For the price of one.

230
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,339
And a special is just a special promotion.

231
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,399
A special price.

232
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,399
Special price.

233
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,959
Two for one special.

234
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:48,540
All right.

235
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:49,199
All right.

236
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,199
Now a very easy phrase.

237
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,360
Would you like.

238
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,459
Would you like.

239
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:54,579
Would you like.

240
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:55,319
Would you like.

241
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,120
Now this is a great way to offer something.

242
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,360
It's a more polite way of asking.

243
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,819
Do you want.

244
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,560
Do you want.

245
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,379
Do you want is okay.

246
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:06,540
Yeah, it's fine.

247
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,699
But it's less polite than would you like.

248
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,240
So whenever you offer something, would you like a cup of coffee?

249
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,560
Would you like to sit down?

250
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,160
Okay.

251
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:17,560
Yep.

252
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:18,860
So would you like.

253
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:25,899
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about pizza from a pizza expert.

254
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,980
Good evening.

255
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,439
This is Marty speaking.

256
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,699
May I take your order?

257
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:43,100
Um, yes, I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives and extra cheese.

258
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,420
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

259
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,360
Would you like a large pizza instead?

260
00:07:49,019 --> 00:07:49,199
Sure.

261
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,860
That sounds good.

262
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:50,860
Great.

263
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,360
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

264
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,000
No, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers.

265
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,300
Oh, and make it thin crust.

266
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,279
Okay.

267
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,360
Thin crust.

268
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,600
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

269
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,819
Perfect.

270
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Thank you.

271
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:07,920
Bye.

272
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,939
Sir, wait, I need your address.

273
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,639
All right, we're back and we are here with our pizza expert.

274
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,279
Who else but Marco from ItalianPod.

275
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,480
Hi everyone.

276
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,600
Marco two, right?

277
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:22,540
Marco one.

278
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:24,399
I am Marco zero.

279
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
He is Marco one.

280
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:25,980
Yes.

281
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,160
We've come to an agreement.

282
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,040
So zero.

283
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,939
What's the deal about this?

284
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:36,440
Well, we're talking about pizza today and we wanted to know what's your opinion since pizza comes from Italy, right?

285
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,220
Well, thanks for the question first.

286
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,980
Marco zero.

287
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:40,179
Is my mic working?

288
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,320
It should be.

289
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

290
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,080
So the problem with pizza is that yes, it comes from Italy.

291
00:08:49,419 --> 00:08:55,240
Originated, the story goes, Regina Margherita.

292
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,600
Queen Margherita.

293
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:57,840
All right.

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,799
But the problem is that now this confusion worldwide pizza and pizza hut, American pizza, Italian pizza, that is not the same thing.

295
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,600
It's not the same.

296
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,759
It's not the same.

297
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,200
So pizza hut is an Italian pizza.

298
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,919
No, no.

299
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,259
So, okay, here it goes.

300
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Italians, a little bit of Italians make food, but they're not good at branding it.

301
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:27,539
Okay.

302
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,519
Americans are very good at branding the food.

303
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,519
So they have Starbucks and pizza hut and blah, blah, blah.

304
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,720
The problem is that since they have to brand it, they don't change the name.

305
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,919
So they do this pizza hut that is totally different from Italian pizza.

306
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,299
How is it different?

307
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,019
Have you ever seen the two of them?

308
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,220
Have you ever compared them?

309
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:49,980
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:51,059
They are very different.

311
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,580
That's true.

312
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,220
So, okay.

313
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,120
Can you put pineapple and ham on a pizza?

314
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,039
Technically you could.

315
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:00,039
Like it's possible.

316
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,200
As long as you call it Hawaiian, you can put pineapple in everything, I guess.

317
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:18,720
But the problem, what I'm trying to say is that, okay, Italian pizza is, you know, you have the flour, the pasta, the pasta, the pizza, the crust, the crust, the crust, the tomato sauce, and then the cheese.

318
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,440
And that's the basic.

319
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,000
And then you can build on top of it with some variations.

320
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,759
American pizza is basically take everything that you have on the table and put it on it.

321
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,799
That's the main difference.

322
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,340
But I'm not saying I'm against the American pizza.

323
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,100
I'm saying that you just should change the name to another thing.

324
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
What do you suggest we should call it?

325
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,200
Zippa.

326
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,080
Zippa.

327
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:40,700
Close enough.

328
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:41,460
Close enough.

329
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,259
Maybe you need like an A, like a Zippa.

330
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,539
A Zippa.

331
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,960
To indicate that it's American.

332
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,059
A for America.

333
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:48,919
Maybe.

334
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,340
A dot Zippa.

335
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:52,879
A dot Zippa dot com.

336
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,019
Can I have A, A Zippa.

337
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:03,960
So Margaux, I know that you are very much against having Pizza Hut pizza.

338
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:14,259
I like it as an exotic experience because I like the fact that it's so much stuff in it that you cannot even tell the difference between the ingredients.

339
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:20,659
You know, they have the super mega, super, super, super, super cheese in the crust.

340
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,139
I don't even know what's inside.

341
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,059
Yeah, it's great.

342
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,759
It's great.

343
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,500
It's like there's a part in my mouth and everybody's invited.

344
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,519
That's for me the feeling.

345
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,759
Well, another interesting thing when we were eating with pizza with Marco is that he noticed the way that people from different countries eat pizza.

346
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,360
That's right.

347
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,200
Italian people fold their pizza.

348
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,519
We do fold.

349
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,960
And another thing is that we have a whole pizza.

350
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,659
If I order one pizza, it's not like I share, everybody has one slice of it.

351
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,019
We order one pizza, you order your pizza, she order her pizza and so on.

352
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,100
Pizza is personal.

353
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,379
Pizza is a personal thing.

354
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,620
Don't mess with my pizza, Marco Zero.

355
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:57,740
All right.

356
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,419
Well, this whole pizza discussion, let's see what our listeners have to say about it.

357
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,039
I know that we have listeners from all over the world and what do they do with their pizzas?

358
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:07,539
Or their Zippas.

359
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,460
Or their Zippas.

360
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,200
What do you like on your pizza?

361
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,759
Exactly.

362
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,460
How high do you want the crust to be?

363
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,279
How high?

364
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,600
I know that for example, in some countries they put ketchup on their pizza.

365
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,159
I know once I was eating, I had a Japanese friend who ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut and the pizza had the pineapple and other stuff on it.

366
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,000
And then she took out like ketchup and mayonnaise.

367
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,059
Oh no.

368
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,259
Like wild.

369
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:42,460
Although, I must tell you, I like Tabasco on my pizza and I know that's wrong.

370
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:42,899
I know.

371
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,399
I'm sorry, but I like it.

372
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:48,679
You do what you have to do, Erika.

373
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,799
Then, you know, history will judge you for that.

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,919
All right, we better go.

375
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:53,620
We're out of time.

376
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:58,080
And before Marco has a heart attack or an aneurysm or something, we're making him angry here.

377
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,179
And if you have any questions for us and also for Marco, because I'm sure he's going to be commenting on this aspect.

378
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:05,039
Sure.

379
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,919
So go to our comments section at EnglishPod.com.

380
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,759
And Marco and I are Marco Zero and I are always there to answer your questions.

381
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:14,919
All right, everyone.

382
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,019
We'll see you there.

383
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:16,519
Goodbye.
