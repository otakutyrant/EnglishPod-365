00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're bringing you a great elementary podcast today.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And we're going to be teaching you how to order pizza.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yeah.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You know, pizza is one of my favorite foods and the favorite food of many people.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's one of those common foods that you're at home and you want to order something to eat.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And the typical thing is pizza.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But, you know, there's some very special language that you've got to use.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You've got to know this language when you want to order a pizza.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Exactly.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So let's listen to this dialogue for the first time as a man is ordering pizza.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Good evening, Pizza House.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is Marty speaking.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
May I take your order?

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Um, yes.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives and extra cheese.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Would you like a large pizza instead?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Sure.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That sounds good.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Great.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, and make it thin crust.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thin crust.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Perfect.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Bye.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sir, wait.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I need your address.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I guess he's not getting his pizza.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, he forgot to give his address.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's a bit of a problem.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's take a look at some of the vocabulary in language takeaway.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All right.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We've got some great pizza words for you today.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And the first one we have is a medium pizza.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Medium pizza.

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Medium pizza.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So that's the size, right?

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Medium.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can say medium or...

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
12 inch.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
12 inch.

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Usually a medium pizza is 12 inches.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So you could say, I'd like a 12 inch pizza.

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
For those of us who use centimeters, this would be more or less 30 centimeters.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
All right.

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's take a look at the next size.

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A large pizza.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Large pizza.

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
A large pizza.

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So it might also be called an 18 inch.

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
An 18 inch pizza.

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Or isn't it sometimes called a family size?

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Family size.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I guess it depends where you're ordering.

71
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah.

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

73
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So large and medium pizzas.

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now let's take a look at some of the ingredients.

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We have pepperoni.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Pepperoni.

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Pepperoni.

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Pepperoni.

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the common ingredient in all pizza.

82
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's my favorite.

83
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A pizza is not a pizza unless it has pepperoni.

84
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay.

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So pepperoni is a sausage, right?

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah.

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's a little bit spicy.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A little bit spicy.

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And they look like a...

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Like circles.

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Red circles.

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yep.

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay.

94
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Olives.

95
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Olives.

96
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Olives.

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Olives.

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Olives are little black or green balls.

99
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Little green or black balls.

101
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can also find them in a martini.

102
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yep.

104
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's very common for them to have...

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's very common to have an...

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's very common to have an olive in a martini.

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay.

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And he also ordered extra cheese.

110
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Extra cheese.

111
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So that means more cheese.

112
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Extra.

113
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right.

114
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Another ingredient.

115
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Ham.

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ham.

117
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Ham.

118
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The meat of a pig.

119
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

120
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ham.

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yep.

122
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

123
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And he also ordered another strange ingredient for a pizza.

124
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Pineapple.

125
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Pineapple.

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Pineapple.

127
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Pineapple.

128
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now this is a fruit.

129
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I know.

130
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So weird to put pineapple on a pizza.

131
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Many people like pineapple on their pizza.

132
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a tropical fruit.

133
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yep.

134
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Comes from Hawaii.

135
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Usually.

136
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And it kind of looks like a little palm tree at the top.

137
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

138
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The top of a pineapple looks like a tree.

139
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So pineapple.

140
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yep.

141
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All right.

142
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now the last description of a pizza.

143
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He ordered it with thin crust.

144
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thin crust.

145
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thin crust.

146
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thin crust.

147
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now we know thin is...

148
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Skinny.

149
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Skinny.

150
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But crust.

151
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What is crust?

152
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's the bread part of the pizza.

153
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The outside part.

154
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yep.

155
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

156
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So that's the crust.

157
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's my favorite part of the pizza.

158
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Really?

159
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah.

160
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thin crust or thick crust?

161
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thin crust.

162
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

163
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thin crust.

164
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And I really love that bread part.

165
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's so important to a good pizza.

166
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay.

167
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, you know, they also have the crust filled with cheese.

168
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I know.

169
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's so wrong.

170
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's good too.

171
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No.

172
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right.

173
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again.

174
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

175
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Good evening.

176
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Pizza house.

177
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is Marty speaking.

178
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
May I take your order?

179
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Um, yes.

180
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese.

181
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

182
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Would you like a large pizza instead?

183
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sure.

184
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That sounds good.

185
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Great.

186
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first?

187
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No.

188
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Make the second one with ham, pineapple, and green peppers.

189
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, and make it thin crust.

190
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

191
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thin crust.

192
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

193
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Perfect.

194
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you.

195
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bye.

196
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Sir.

197
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Wait.

198
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I need your address.

199
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

200
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now we have some really polite language that you could use possibly with customers or with clients.

201
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yep.

202
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

203
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So let's take a look at them in fluency builder.

204
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Fluency builder.

205
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

206
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
My, all right.

207
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The first phrase we have, um, I think is my favorite.

208
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Uh, this is the way that Marty answered the phone, right?

209
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He said, this is Marty speaking.

210
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is Marty speaking.

211
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is Marty speaking.

212
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now, why is this so important?

213
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Cause a lot of people when they answer the phone say, I'm Erica.

214
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Like, hello, I'm Erica, which is not what English people say.

215
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We always say Erica speaking.

216
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is Erica speaking.

217
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Exactly.

218
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So guys remember this, you'll sound really, really great when you use this on the phone.

219
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is Marty speaking.

220
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Exactly.

221
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is Marty.

222
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, don't use Marty.

223
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Use your name.

224
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All right.

225
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And you also mentioned a two for one special.

226
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Two for one special.

227
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A two for one special.

228
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So that means you're getting two pizzas, right?

229
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
For the price of one.

230
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And a special is just a special promotion.

231
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
A special price.

232
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Special price.

233
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Two for one special.

234
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All right.

235
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
All right.

236
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now a very easy phrase.

237
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Would you like.

238
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Would you like.

239
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Would you like.

240
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Would you like.

241
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Now this is a great way to offer something.

242
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a more polite way of asking.

243
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you want.

244
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you want.

245
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Do you want is okay.

246
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, it's fine.

247
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But it's less polite than would you like.

248
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So whenever you offer something, would you like a cup of coffee?

249
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Would you like to sit down?

250
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

251
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yep.

252
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So would you like.

253
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk about pizza from a pizza expert.

254
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Good evening.

255
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is Marty speaking.

256
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
May I take your order?

257
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Um, yes, I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni, olives and extra cheese.

258
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We have a two for one special on large pizzas.

259
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Would you like a large pizza instead?

260
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sure.

261
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That sounds good.

262
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Great.

263
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Would you like your second pizza to be the same size as the first?

264
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, make the second one with ham, pineapple and green peppers.

265
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, and make it thin crust.

266
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay.

267
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thin crust.

268
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Your total is $21.50 and your order will arrive in 30 minutes or it's free.

269
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Perfect.

270
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank you.

271
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Bye.

272
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Sir, wait, I need your address.

273
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, we're back and we are here with our pizza expert.

274
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Who else but Marco from ItalianPod.

275
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hi everyone.

276
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Marco two, right?

277
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Marco one.

278
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I am Marco zero.

279
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He is Marco one.

280
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

281
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We've come to an agreement.

282
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So zero.

283
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What's the deal about this?

284
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, we're talking about pizza today and we wanted to know what's your opinion since pizza comes from Italy, right?

285
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, thanks for the question first.

286
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Marco zero.

287
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is my mic working?

288
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It should be.

289
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

290
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So the problem with pizza is that yes, it comes from Italy.

291
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Originated, the story goes, Regina Margherita.

292
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Queen Margherita.

293
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All right.

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But the problem is that now this confusion worldwide pizza and pizza hut, American pizza, Italian pizza, that is not the same thing.

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's not the same.

296
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not the same.

297
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So pizza hut is an Italian pizza.

298
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No, no.

299
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So, okay, here it goes.

300
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Italians, a little bit of Italians make food, but they're not good at branding it.

301
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

302
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Americans are very good at branding the food.

303
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So they have Starbucks and pizza hut and blah, blah, blah.

304
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The problem is that since they have to brand it, they don't change the name.

305
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So they do this pizza hut that is totally different from Italian pizza.

306
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How is it different?

307
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Have you ever seen the two of them?

308
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Have you ever compared them?

309
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They are very different.

311
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's true.

312
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, okay.

313
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Can you put pineapple and ham on a pizza?

314
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Technically you could.

315
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Like it's possible.

316
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
As long as you call it Hawaiian, you can put pineapple in everything, I guess.

317
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But the problem, what I'm trying to say is that, okay, Italian pizza is, you know, you have the flour, the pasta, the pasta, the pizza, the crust, the crust, the crust, the tomato sauce, and then the cheese.

318
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And that's the basic.

319
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And then you can build on top of it with some variations.

320
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
American pizza is basically take everything that you have on the table and put it on it.

321
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's the main difference.

322
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But I'm not saying I'm against the American pizza.

323
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm saying that you just should change the name to another thing.

324
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you suggest we should call it?

325
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Zippa.

326
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Zippa.

327
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Close enough.

328
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Close enough.

329
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Maybe you need like an A, like a Zippa.

330
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
A Zippa.

331
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
To indicate that it's American.

332
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A for America.

333
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Maybe.

334
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A dot Zippa.

335
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A dot Zippa dot com.

336
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Can I have A, A Zippa.

337
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So Margaux, I know that you are very much against having Pizza Hut pizza.

338
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I like it as an exotic experience because I like the fact that it's so much stuff in it that you cannot even tell the difference between the ingredients.

339
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know, they have the super mega, super, super, super, super cheese in the crust.

340
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't even know what's inside.

341
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, it's great.

342
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's great.

343
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's like there's a part in my mouth and everybody's invited.

344
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's for me the feeling.

345
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, another interesting thing when we were eating with pizza with Marco is that he noticed the way that people from different countries eat pizza.

346
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's right.

347
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Italian people fold their pizza.

348
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We do fold.

349
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And another thing is that we have a whole pizza.

350
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If I order one pizza, it's not like I share, everybody has one slice of it.

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We order one pizza, you order your pizza, she order her pizza and so on.

352
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Pizza is personal.

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Pizza is a personal thing.

354
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't mess with my pizza, Marco Zero.

355
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
All right.

356
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, this whole pizza discussion, let's see what our listeners have to say about it.

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I know that we have listeners from all over the world and what do they do with their pizzas?

358
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Or their Zippas.

359
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or their Zippas.

360
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you like on your pizza?

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Exactly.

362
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How high do you want the crust to be?

363
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How high?

364
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I know that for example, in some countries they put ketchup on their pizza.

365
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I know once I was eating, I had a Japanese friend who ordered a pizza from Pizza Hut and the pizza had the pineapple and other stuff on it.

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then she took out like ketchup and mayonnaise.

367
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh no.

368
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Like wild.

369
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Although, I must tell you, I like Tabasco on my pizza and I know that's wrong.

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know.

371
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm sorry, but I like it.

372
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You do what you have to do, Erika.

373
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Then, you know, history will judge you for that.

374
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All right, we better go.

375
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We're out of time.

376
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And before Marco has a heart attack or an aneurysm or something, we're making him angry here.

377
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And if you have any questions for us and also for Marco, because I'm sure he's going to be commenting on this aspect.

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sure.

379
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So go to our comments section at EnglishPod.com.

380
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And Marco and I are Marco Zero and I are always there to answer your questions.

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,000
All right, everyone.

382
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We'll see you there.

383
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Goodbye.
