00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,860
EnglishPod.com Right away, sir.

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:09,419
Your order will be ready shortly.

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,679
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for Table 7.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm working as fast as I can.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,640
We are wheeling the weeds.

6
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,199
Where is my sous-chef?

7
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:17,940
Look!

8
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,640
I need you to peel more potatoes.

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:22,820
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,460
Thank you.

11
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,019
Jean-Pierre, another special.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,460
We're really patched tonight.

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,940
We're running low on wine.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,359
Is there any left in the cellar?

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,619
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,700
Wow, we're really doing well tonight.

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:38,439
Hi.

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,259
Stop talking and get over here.

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,840
I need some sous-tide and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,259
Okay, I'm on it.

21
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,460
Jean-Pierre, Table 7 has requested to see the chef.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,939
I think there are food critics from Cuisine Magazine.
