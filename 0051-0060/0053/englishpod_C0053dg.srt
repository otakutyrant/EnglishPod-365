00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Right away, sir.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Your order will be ready shortly.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for Table 7.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm working as fast as I can.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are wheeling the weeds.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Where is my sous-chef?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Look!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I need you to peel more potatoes.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Jean-Pierre, another special.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're really patched tonight.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We're running low on wine.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Is there any left in the cellar?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Wow, we're really doing well tonight.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Stop talking and get over here.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I need some sous-tide and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, I'm on it.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Jean-Pierre, Table 7 has requested to see the chef.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think there are food critics from Cuisine Magazine.
