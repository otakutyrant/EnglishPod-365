00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello English learners and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,240
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:10,480
And today we're back bringing you another great lesson, an intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,259
That's right, about one of my favorite subjects.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,880
We're talking about food.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,500
Exactly.

8
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:22,280
So on this occasion we're going to be talking about food, so let's preview some words on Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,300
Alright, we have three words for you today.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,620
And the first word is head chef.

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:32,960
Head chef.

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:33,840
Head chef.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,920
So what is a head chef?

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,479
Well, in a professional kitchen, this is the boss of the kitchen, or the leader of the kitchen.

15
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:45,780
Okay, so the head chef is the main cook.

16
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,560
Yes, but he doesn't cook.

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,000
But he doesn't cook.

18
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:49,539
Okay.

19
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,979
Alright, so if he doesn't cook, who's the one that does the cooking?

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:56,439
That brings us to our second word, sous chef.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,500
Sous chef.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,500
Sous chef.

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,100
Sous chef.

24
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:01,399
S-O-U-S.

25
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,019
So the S is silent because it's like a French word.

26
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,159
Yeah, something like that.

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,340
Okay, so the sous chef is the second in line to the head chef.

28
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,319
Yeah, he's the number two.

29
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:10,980
Number two.

30
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,560
So he's basically the one that's doing some of the work.

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,019
Yeah.

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,540
In the kitchen.

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:14,819
Yep.

34
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:18,200
Now let's take a look at our last word, cuisine.

35
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:19,180
Cuisine.

36
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,260
Cuisine.

37
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:20,739
Cuisine.

38
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,500
So this is an interesting word.

39
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,819
What exactly does it mean?

40
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,560
Well, it basically means cooking, right?

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,099
Okay.

42
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,840
Like the art of cooking.

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,359
So for example, I can say French food.

44
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:33,319
Yep, or French cuisine.

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,819
French cuisine, which includes all the food.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,180
Yep.

47
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,620
And this is also the major that people study in college to become a chef.

48
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:40,959
Yep.

49
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:41,859
They study cuisine.

50
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,659
And cuisine is a noun, right?

51
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,420
It's a noun.

52
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,900
Okay, so I think we're ready to dive into our dialogue.

53
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,280
What exactly is going on?

54
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,099
Well, we're in a restaurant, and it's a really busy night.

55
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:56,719
And so we're going to listen to what is happening in the kitchen.

56
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,540
Right away, sir, your order will be ready shortly.

57
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,800
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for table seven.

58
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,620
I'm working as fast as I can.

59
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,659
We are ready.

60
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,960
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,139
Jean-Pierre, another special.

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
We're really packed tonight.

63
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,039
We're running low on wine.

64
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,460
Is there any left in the cellar?

65
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,699
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Wow, we're really doing well tonight.

67
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:36,520
Hi.

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,360
Stop talking and get over here.

69
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,939
I need some sauce and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

70
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,400
Okay, I'm on it.

71
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,580
Jean-Pierre, table seven has requested to see the chef.

72
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,159
I think there are food critics from cuisine magazine.

73
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,159
Okay, so a busy night here at this restaurant.

74
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,080
I know it sounds like there's a lot of pressure on this chef.

75
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:00,460
Yeah.

76
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,539
Yeah, you can you can tell in his voice that he's really stressed out.

77
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:04,780
Yeah.

78
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:10,479
Okay, let's take a look at some of this kitchen vocabulary that we found in language takeaway.

79
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:13,259
Language takeaway.

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,439
Alright, well we've got five words for you today and the first one is peel.

81
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,379
Peel.

82
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,199
Peel.

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,740
Peel.

84
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,479
P-E-E-L.

85
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,180
So this is a verb and it means to remove the outside skin.

86
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,379
Okay, so for example when you're gonna eat a banana.

87
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,800
You must peel it first.

88
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:36,520
You must peel it.

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,180
You take away the yellow skin.

90
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,919
What else do you peel?

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,659
Oranges, potatoes.

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,979
Potatoes, like in the dialogue.

93
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,699
What else can you peel?

94
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,900
I don't know, carrots.

95
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:48,280
Carrots.

96
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:48,599
Yeah.

97
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:50,139
Some people peel their tomatoes.

98
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,860
I don't know why.

99
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,879
Yeah, it is kind of weird.

100
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,379
Alright, now let's take a look at our next word.

101
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,219
Chop.

102
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,039
Chop.

103
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,039
Chop.

104
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,659
Chop.

105
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,099
So again, another verb and it means to.

106
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,900
It means to cut food into pieces.

107
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,520
So if you're gonna eat carrots, first you gotta chop them.

108
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:07,979
Exactly.

109
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,120
Right, you can put a whole carrot in your soup or in your rice.

110
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,759
Okay, chop.

111
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay, our next word, stirred.

112
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,879
Yeah, this is the past participle of the word stir.

113
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,500
Okay, so the verb stir.

114
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:23,139
Stir.

115
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,199
So when you stir something.

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,899
Imagine you have a big pot and you've got a long spoon.

117
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,279
You move the spoon around in circles.

118
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,899
So you're stirring the pot.

119
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:35,620
You're mixing.

120
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,220
To stir is very similar to mix.

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:38,639
Yes.

122
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,040
Okay, so you just move the food around.

123
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,120
Move the food around.

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay, our next word, butchered.

125
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,680
Again, the past participle of the verb butcher.

126
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,199
Okay, butcher.

127
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Butcher.

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,980
Now this verb, to butcher something, it's when you remove all the bones and all the organs from the meat.

129
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,000
Exactly, so you cut up the meat.

130
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,160
And this is interesting because it's also a noun.

131
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,959
Right, a butcher is a person who cuts up meat.

132
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,899
Okay, so it's really easy.

133
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,660
A butcher butchers meat.

134
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Yes.

135
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,220
All right, our last word, butter.

136
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,240
Buttered.

137
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,420
Buttered.

138
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,279
Buttered.

139
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,519
Okay, so buttered, this is weird.

140
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,480
I know, normally we all know the noun butter, but here it's acting as a verb.

141
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:24,980
Okay.

142
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,040
So when you butter something, you spread or put butter on it.

143
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,620
Okay, so to put butter on something.

144
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,439
So you can butter a piece of bread.

145
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,160
Exactly.

146
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,939
Or in this case, the fish is being buttered.

147
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,399
Sounds delicious.

148
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,259
Okay, now we're ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

149
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,439
We're gonna slow it down a little bit so it's easier to understand.

150
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,319
Right away sir, your order will be ready shortly.

151
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,759
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for table seven.

152
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,879
I'm working as fast as I can.

153
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,139
We are really in the weeds.

154
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,279
Where is my sous chef?

155
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,480
Luke, I need you to peel more potatoes.

156
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,959
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

157
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,339
Jean-Pierre, another special.

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
We're really packed tonight.

159
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,860
We're running low on wine.

160
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,459
Is there any left in the cellar?

161
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,120
Whoa, sorry, I'm late, everyone.

162
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,040
Wow.

163
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,600
We are really doing well tonight.

164
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,680
Harry, stop talking and come over here.

165
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,139
I need this so stirred and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

166
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,779
Okay, I'm on it.

167
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,339
Jean-Pierre, table seven has requested to see the chef.

168
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,259
I think they are food critics from cuisine magazine.

169
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,500
Okay, so that seems to be a little bit better.

170
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,519
And hey, I noticed that there's a lot of really great kitchen words in here, like words that you commonly hear in a professional kitchen.

171
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,680
Okay, so let's take a look at these kitchen words in Fluency Builder.

172
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:09,699
Fluency Builder.

173
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,600
All right, we've got three phrases.

174
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:18,160
And the first one is in the weeds, in the weeds, in the weeds, in the weeds.

175
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,040
So when you're in the weeds, you're so so busy, and you can't do all the work you need to do on time.

176
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
Okay, so in the weeds, it means that you're really busy.

177
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,220
Yes.

178
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,860
And you can't finish everything you have too much to do.

179
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,079
Yeah.

180
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,079
Okay, in the weeds.

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,060
Okay, our next word running low on running low on running low on running low on.

182
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,560
Okay, so before we get into explaining what running low on means, let's listen to some examples.

183
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,439
Example one.

184
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,079
You better look for a gas station.

185
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,800
We're running low on fuel.

186
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,319
Example two.

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,259
We're running low on beers.

188
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,800
Can you go out and get some?

189
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,980
Example three.

190
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,939
My flashlight is running low on battery.

191
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,600
Hurry up before it gets dark.

192
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,899
So basically running low means you don't have much of this left.

193
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,899
You don't have much of something left.

194
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,279
Yeah, so here they're running low on wine.

195
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,279
So basically, there's not much wine left.

196
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:28,600
Right.

197
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,259
So as we heard in the examples, you could also be running low on fuel, for example, in your car, etc.

198
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,360
Running low on.

199
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,679
All right, and now let's take a look at our last word.

200
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,360
Doing really well.

201
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,480
Doing really well.

202
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,679
We are doing really well.

203
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,720
Doing really well.

204
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,139
So this seems to be like a pretty simple structure.

205
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,019
I mean, we know all these words, right?

206
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,379
So why is it special?

207
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,840
Well, basically, if you say I am doing really well, maybe it sounds a little bit difficult to understand.

208
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,159
What are you doing really well?

209
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,879
So this is a great way of answering a question.

210
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,440
When somebody says, how are you?

211
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,600
Or how are you doing?

212
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,279
You can say, I'm doing really well.

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
So I'm doing well.

214
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,000
In your life, everything is good.

215
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,200
In your life, things are good.

216
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,759
And you're happy, basically.

217
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,019
Yeah.

218
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,779
But in this situation, in the dialogue, what's doing really well?

219
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,940
Well, the restaurant is doing really well, the business is doing really well.

220
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,220
So when he says we're doing really well, business is good, good.

221
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,279
They're making lots of money.

222
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:27,899
Exactly.

223
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:35,740
So you can use it with people, you can use it with businesses, you can say, Oh, I'm doing really well in my new job.

224
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,100
Yep.

225
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,200
Or my son is doing really well in school.

226
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,600
Yep.

227
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,500
Okay, so you can use it in those different ways.

228
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,139
All right, well, let's listen to the dialogue one last time.

229
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,299
And we'll be able to hear all of these great words and phrases we just talked about.

230
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,659
Right away, sir, your order will be ready shortly.

231
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,919
Jean-Pierre, we have another special for table seven.

232
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm working as fast as I can.

233
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:03,860
We are wheeling the weeds.

234
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,399
Where is my sous chef?

235
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,879
Look, I need you to peel my potatoes.

236
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,100
Marie, chop some onions and carrots for the stew.

237
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,279
Jean-Pierre, another special.

238
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:18,700
We're really patched tonight.

239
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,159
We're running low on wine.

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,600
Is there any left in the cellar?

241
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,860
Sorry, I'm late, everyone.

242
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,940
Wow, we're really doing well tonight.

243
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:26,639
Hi.

244
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,500
Top talking and get over here.

245
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,059
I need some sauce and the fish needs to be butchered and buttered.

246
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,500
Okay, I'm on it.

247
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,679
Jean-Pierre, table seven has requested to see the chef.

248
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,220
I think there are food critics from Cuisine magazine.

249
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,259
So Marco, do you think this chef had a rat under his hat?

250
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,340
That was a really good movie.

251
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Yeah.

252
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,360
Ratatouille at Disney Pixar, where a rat is a cook.

253
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:53,860
Yes.

254
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,679
It's interesting.

255
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,500
I love to cook but I'm not very good at cooking.

256
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Really?

257
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,740
But it's good because for me it helps me relieve stress.

258
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,399
Me too, actually.

259
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:08,360
You know, if I'm in a bad mood, I go home and cook something to eat and the world seems a happier place.

260
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,139
And people don't understand it because they think cooking is work.

261
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,879
Yeah, but you know for some people it's fun.

262
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:15,279
Yeah.

263
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,679
So what about you guys?

264
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,840

265
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,980
