00:00:01,899 --> 00:00:04,500
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,280
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,320
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,820
And today we're going to be bringing you a great lesson that's talking about a bank robbery.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,420
Yes, and this is an important lesson for all of our future bank robbers out there.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:27,640
Yeah, we are going to teach you some words that you would use for planning a bank robbery, but you can apply them to other situations, hopefully not.

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,579
Yeah, I hope you apply them to other situations.

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,060
Hopefully you won't rob a bank, we don't want to be responsible for any crimes you can commit.

9
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:36,539
Yep.

10
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,159
Alright, so why don't we start by looking at some of the vocabulary in vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,179
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,619
We have one word for you today that you'll hear in the dialogue and it is filling in.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,899
Filling in.

14
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:52,859
Filling in.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
So to fill in for somebody, right?

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:56,600
Yep.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,200
That means that you are replacing them.

18
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,760
Yes, so if Marco can't host the show today, maybe Danny will fill in.

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,120
Okay, so to take the place of someone.

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:07,659
Exactly.

21
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:08,260
Alright.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,939
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue.

23
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,480
Let's listen to this bank robbery and let's see what happens.

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,019
Alright, so this is what we're going to do.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,500
I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.

26
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,099
Mr.

27
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:32,000
Rabbit, you and Mr.

28
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,980
Fox will go to the bank wearing these uniforms.

29
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:37,719
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

30
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,019
Got it.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,840
No problem, boss.

32
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:46,180
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

33
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,700
Don't lose your cool.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,099
Just act natural.

35
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,019
What if they want to call and confirm?

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,379
You let them.

37
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,239
What?

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,180
Don't worry.

39
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,659
We have the phones tapped so the call will be patched through to me and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

40
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,879
You're so clever, boss.

41
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,519
Okay, shut up.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,859
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,239
Don't get greedy.

44
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:07,939
Are you ready?

45
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,139
Let's go.

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:17,259
Well, it sounds like a pretty interesting plan.

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
It does sound like a plan.

48
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:19,400
Do you think it'll work?

49
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,639
Um, I don't know.

50
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,840
I guess we'll have to maybe talk a little bit about that later.

51
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:24,520
Okay.

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:24,900
Yeah.

53
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,500
Let's take a look at the language that we saw in language takeaway.

54
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,280
Language takeaway.

55
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:32,699
Okay.

56
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,780
We heard five really great words in this dialogue that I'd like to look at now in language takeaway.

57
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,460
So let's go to the first one.

58
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,639
Um, now we heard the boss say that they got replicas of the uniforms, right?

59
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,419
Replicas, replicas, replicas, replicas.

60
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,439
So it's, this is really easy.

61
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,939
Something that's a replica is a copy.

62
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:55,719
Exactly.

63
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:56,180
Right.

64
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,439
So for example, in Las Vegas, there's a replica of the Eiffel Tower of Paris.

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:01,840
Yes.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,460
Actually, I lived in a small city where there was also a replica of the Eiffel Tower.

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:06,919
Really?

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,219
Yeah.

69
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,800
In France.

70
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,460
Um, that is kind of weird.

71
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,259
Well, there are a lot of replicas even now on the street.

72
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,280
Maybe you can see replica watches, right?

73
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,460
That supposedly are Rolex, but they're not.

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:19,919
Yep.

75
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,639
And many, many other things.

76
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:22,639
So copies.

77
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

78
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,000
Not the real thing.

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,939
Not the real thing.

80
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,639
All right.

81
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,360
So let's take a look at the next word.

82
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,300
Tapped.

83
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,719
We have the phones tapped.

84
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,340
We have the phones tapped.

85
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:34,039
Tapped.

86
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:42,800
So if you tap someone's phone, you do something to the telephone line so that you can hear their conversations, right?

87
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,300
Right.

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,180
And actually the police do this sometimes, right?

89
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,520
Right.

90
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,840
You see it in movies all the time.

91
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,219
Yeah.

92
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,439
Yeah.

93
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,460
So you connect a wire to the phone so you can listen to the conversation.

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,240
Exactly.

95
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,120
So you tap the telephone.

96
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,020
So in our dialogue, they tapped the bank's phone, right?

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,259
You know, he said if they make a call, he will patch the call through.

98
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:04,819
Yes.

99
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,060
To him.

100
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:06,539
Yes.

101
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:06,879
Right.

102
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,060
So patch through through.

103
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,379
Yeah.

104
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,340
Patch a call through patch through.

105
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,080
Now we still use this today.

106
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,419
Yeah.

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,800
Like if you call an office, right?

108
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,980
And you say, Oh, can you patch me through to Carol?

109
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:19,560
Yes.

110
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,040
Right.

111
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,360
So can you connect me to another phone line?

112
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,060
Connect me.

113
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,279
Yeah.

114
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:25,600
Right.

115
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,360
All right.

116
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,439
Now let's take a look at our next words.

117
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,500
Clever.

118
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,180
Yes.

119
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,100
The boss is very clever.

120
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,959
Boss is very clever.

121
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:34,819
All right.

122
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:37,139
So if you're clever, you're, you're smart.

123
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:37,480
Yeah.

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,800
You're quite clever.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,439
And this is a clever plan.

126
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,420
Clever plan.

127
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:44,920
Exactly.

128
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,240
Now let's take a look at our last word.

129
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,399
Don't be greedy.

130
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:50,839
Greedy.

131
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,720
Greedy.

132
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,360
Greedy.

133
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,480
To be greedy is a bad thing, right?

134
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,860
You want everything.

135
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,139
You want everything for you.

136
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:57,459
Yes.

137
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,379
You don't share.

138
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,720
Yes.

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,620
So like at lunch today when you had that cake and I didn't share.

140
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,079
Yeah.

141
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,399
I was very greedy.

142
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:07,000
Uh huh.

143
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:08,259
Yes.

144
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,519
With food, I am greedy.

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,240
All right.

146
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,819
So these are some great words.

147
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:20,420
And I think, um, you know, if we listen to the dialogue another time, um, a little bit more slowly, we'll be able to hear them a little bit better.

148
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,040
All right.

149
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:31,120
So this is what we're going to do.

150
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,620
I've carefully mapped this out.

151
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,279
So don't screw it up.

152
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,180
Mr.

153
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,480
Rabbit, you and Mr.

154
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,860
Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms.

155
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,800
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear when they pick up the money.

156
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,120
Got it.

157
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,180
No problem, boss.

158
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:56,480
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

159
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,620
Don't lose your cool.

160
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,759
Just act natural.

161
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,139
What if they want to call and confirm?

162
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,800
You don't worry.

163
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:14,160
We have the phones tapped so the call will be patched through to me and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

164
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,939
You're so clever, boss.

165
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,360
Okay, shut up.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,120
Only take as much money as you can fit into these bags.

167
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,980
Don't get greedy.

168
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,199
Are you ready?

169
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,699
Let's take a look at some of these great phrases in fluency builder.

170
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:41,560
Fluency builder.

171
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,379
We've got three phrases for you here.

172
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,100
Um, and these are all phrases you might use when you're planning something.

173
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:57,420
So the first one mapped out, I've carefully mapped this out, mapped out to map out.

174
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,680
So when you map something out, what do you do?

175
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:03,319
Well, you literally create a plan.

176
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,000
You draw a map of what you're going to do.

177
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,180
So here, is it only for like travel or no, no, no.

178
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:17,079
It's like, for example, if we're starting a new project in the company, you can map out the project, what you're going to do this month, next month.

179
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's a plan.

180
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,579
So you draw every step in the plan, every step.

181
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:21,899
Right.

182
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,839
So you said, well, I've mapped out this plan for a new project.

183
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:27,339
Okay.

184
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,220
Interesting word.

185
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,040
I think we should hear some examples of how it's used.

186
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:33,560
Example one.

187
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,519
So I have the future all mapped out.

188
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,459
Well, you'll get a job as a waiter, then we'll get married.

189
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
And two years later, we'll start having kids.

190
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,180
Example two.

191
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,899
We're mapping out the marketing plan at the meeting today.

192
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,000
Example three.

193
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,439
Okay.

194
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,720
I've mapped out our trip and it should take about 10 hours.

195
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:04,560
All right.

196
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,000
So mapped out really, really clear now.

197
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,220
Let's take a look at our next word.

198
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,259
All right.

199
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:13,980
So if you've mapped out a plan, you don't want to screw it up.

200
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:14,459
Right.

201
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,660
Screw it up.

202
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,240
Screw it up.

203
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,500
Or screw up.

204
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:18,899
Yep.

205
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:23,860
So to screw something up means that you made a mistake on something or you did something wrong.

206
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,699
You did it wrong.

207
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,019
Yep.

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:25,980
Okay.

209
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,620
So for example, if I'm taking an exam and I make a mistake, I screwed up on the exam.

210
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:32,379
Exactly.

211
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,159
Or for example, here, when we're recording, Marco and I make mistakes a lot.

212
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,019
Maybe more me than Marco.

213
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,360
We always screw up.

214
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,840
Yeah, exactly.

215
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,519
So to make a mistake, it's a really informal word, but very, very common.

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,899
Yeah.

217
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,700
And you know, it sounds really, really natural when people use this.

218
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,200
All right.

219
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,220
So now let's take a look at our last word.

220
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:53,820
Lose your cool.

221
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,820
Lose your cool.

222
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,740
Don't lose your cool.

223
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,820
So what is this to lose your cool?

224
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,960
It's a weird expression.

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,039
It's a weird expression.

226
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:07,460
Why don't we just give you an example of a person that loses his or her cool?

227
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,559
What do you mean you're not ready to go?

228
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,220
It's time to go.

229
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,139
We have to go now.

230
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:13,799
Boninato.

231
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:14,840
We were supposed to leave.

232
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:15,700
Punieta.

233
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,779
Now we're sitting here again.

234
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:17,779
I'm going to wait for you.

235
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:18,720
Boninam.

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:20,740
Okay.

237
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,000
So basically you lose your temper.

238
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,500
You become irritated.

239
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,919
You lose control of your emotions, right?

240
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,940
So Marco, when you lose your cool, is it always that you get angry?

241
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,980
You don't always get angry.

242
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,419
Maybe you get irritated or impatient or even nervous.

243
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:38,179
Nervous.

244
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,460
Yep.

245
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:38,820
Right.

246
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,399
So basically you're not in control of your emotions.

247
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,679
Yeah.

248
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,279
Okay.

249
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:51,740
So we've looked at a lot of great phrases, a lot of great words, so we can listen to our dialogue now for the third time, and then we'll come back and talk about this bank robbery business.

250
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,779
All right, so this is what we're going to do.

251
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,240
I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.

252
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,879
Mr.

253
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,740
Rabbit, you and Mr.

254
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,759
Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms.

255
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,519
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

256
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:16,759
Got it.

257
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,620
No problem, boss.

258
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,960
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

259
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,460
Don't lose your cool.

260
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,860
Just act natural.

261
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,799
What if they want to call and confirm?

262
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:30,139
You let him.

263
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:30,980
What?

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,940
Don't worry.

265
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:37,259
We have the phones tapped, so the call will be patched through to me, and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

266
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:39,639
You're so clever, boss.

267
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,320
Okay, shut up.

268
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,620
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

269
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,980
Don't get greedy.

270
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,679
Are you ready?

271
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:46,879
Let's go.

272
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,220
So there's a lot of movies about bank robberies, but obviously they happen in real life.

273
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,600
So this dialogue is actually based on real events, right?

274
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,639
Yeah, this actually happened in real life.

275
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,580
It's a violent way of robbing a bank.

276
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,059
Okay, so what happened?

277
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:18,259
Basically, this guy went to a bank dressed up as one of those security guards that transport the money from the bank to another safe place.

278
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,399
He had fake credentials or replica credentials.

279
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,360
So fake ID?

280
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,299
Yeah, he had a replica of the uniform.

281
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:24,799
Wow.

282
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:33,460
And he walked in, he took all these bags, him and his partner, and they took him to the truck and drove off, and the bank didn't realize that they had been robbed.

283
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:35,059
They thought it was a routine thing.

284
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,519
Three or four hours later, the real security guard shows up.

285
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,279
They were long gone, and they still can't find them.

286
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:41,899
Really?

287
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,840
So a very clever plan.

288
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,740
Very clever and very effective.

289
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,899
I think they stole over half a million dollars.

290
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,220
Okay, well guys, don't try this at home.

291
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,519
Don't try this at home but real life, real English, right?

292
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,039
Exactly.

293
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,460
Okay, so come to our website, leave your questions and comments.

294
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,379
Tell us what you think will happen with these guys.

295
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,580
Do you think they'll be successful?

296
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you think they'll get caught?

297
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,580
Yeah, they might end up in jail.

298
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,779
Maybe somebody will lose their cool and get caught, right?

299
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,340
Well, thanks for listening guys, and until next time, goodbye.
