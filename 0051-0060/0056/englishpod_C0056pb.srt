00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're going to be bringing you a great lesson that's talking about a bank robbery.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, and this is an important lesson for all of our future bank robbers out there.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, we are going to teach you some words that you would use for planning a bank robbery, but you can apply them to other situations, hopefully not.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, I hope you apply them to other situations.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hopefully you won't rob a bank, we don't want to be responsible for any crimes you can commit.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yep.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Alright, so why don't we start by looking at some of the vocabulary in vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have one word for you today that you'll hear in the dialogue and it is filling in.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Filling in.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Filling in.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So to fill in for somebody, right?

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yep.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That means that you are replacing them.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, so if Marco can't host the show today, maybe Danny will fill in.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, so to take the place of someone.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Exactly.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay, so now let's listen to our dialogue.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's listen to this bank robbery and let's see what happens.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, so this is what we're going to do.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mr.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Rabbit, you and Mr.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Fox will go to the bank wearing these uniforms.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Got it.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No problem, boss.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't lose your cool.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Just act natural.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What if they want to call and confirm?

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You let them.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't worry.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We have the phones tapped so the call will be patched through to me and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're so clever, boss.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay, shut up.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't get greedy.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Are you ready?

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's go.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, it sounds like a pretty interesting plan.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It does sound like a plan.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you think it'll work?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Um, I don't know.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I guess we'll have to maybe talk a little bit about that later.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yeah.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's take a look at the language that we saw in language takeaway.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Language takeaway.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We heard five really great words in this dialogue that I'd like to look at now in language takeaway.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So let's go to the first one.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Um, now we heard the boss say that they got replicas of the uniforms, right?

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Replicas, replicas, replicas, replicas.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So it's, this is really easy.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Something that's a replica is a copy.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Exactly.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Right.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So for example, in Las Vegas, there's a replica of the Eiffel Tower of Paris.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Actually, I lived in a small city where there was also a replica of the Eiffel Tower.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Really?

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In France.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Um, that is kind of weird.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, there are a lot of replicas even now on the street.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Maybe you can see replica watches, right?

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That supposedly are Rolex, but they're not.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yep.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And many, many other things.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So copies.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Not the real thing.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Not the real thing.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So let's take a look at the next word.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tapped.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We have the phones tapped.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We have the phones tapped.

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tapped.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So if you tap someone's phone, you do something to the telephone line so that you can hear their conversations, right?

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And actually the police do this sometimes, right?

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You see it in movies all the time.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So you connect a wire to the phone so you can listen to the conversation.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Exactly.

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So you tap the telephone.

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So in our dialogue, they tapped the bank's phone, right?

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You know, he said if they make a call, he will patch the call through.

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
To him.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So patch through through.

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yeah.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Patch a call through patch through.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now we still use this today.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Like if you call an office, right?

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And you say, Oh, can you patch me through to Carol?

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right.

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So can you connect me to another phone line?

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Connect me.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Right.

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All right.

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now let's take a look at our next words.

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Clever.

118
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The boss is very clever.

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Boss is very clever.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
All right.

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So if you're clever, you're, you're smart.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're quite clever.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And this is a clever plan.

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Clever plan.

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Exactly.

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Now let's take a look at our last word.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't be greedy.

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Greedy.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Greedy.

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Greedy.

133
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To be greedy is a bad thing, right?

134
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You want everything.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You want everything for you.

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

137
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You don't share.

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

139
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So like at lunch today when you had that cake and I didn't share.

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

141
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was very greedy.

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Uh huh.

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
With food, I am greedy.

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All right.

146
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So these are some great words.

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I think, um, you know, if we listen to the dialogue another time, um, a little bit more slowly, we'll be able to hear them a little bit better.

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All right.

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So this is what we're going to do.

150
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've carefully mapped this out.

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So don't screw it up.

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr.

153
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Rabbit, you and Mr.

154
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms.

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear when they pick up the money.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Got it.

157
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No problem, boss.

158
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

159
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't lose your cool.

160
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Just act natural.

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What if they want to call and confirm?

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You don't worry.

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We have the phones tapped so the call will be patched through to me and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

164
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're so clever, boss.

165
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, shut up.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Only take as much money as you can fit into these bags.

167
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't get greedy.

168
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you ready?

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's take a look at some of these great phrases in fluency builder.

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Fluency builder.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We've got three phrases for you here.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Um, and these are all phrases you might use when you're planning something.

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So the first one mapped out, I've carefully mapped this out, mapped out to map out.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So when you map something out, what do you do?

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, you literally create a plan.

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You draw a map of what you're going to do.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So here, is it only for like travel or no, no, no.

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's like, for example, if we're starting a new project in the company, you can map out the project, what you're going to do this month, next month.

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So it's a plan.

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So you draw every step in the plan, every step.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right.

182
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So you said, well, I've mapped out this plan for a new project.

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Interesting word.

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think we should hear some examples of how it's used.

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Example one.

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So I have the future all mapped out.

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Well, you'll get a job as a waiter, then we'll get married.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And two years later, we'll start having kids.

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Example two.

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We're mapping out the marketing plan at the meeting today.

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Example three.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay.

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've mapped out our trip and it should take about 10 hours.

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All right.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So mapped out really, really clear now.

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's take a look at our next word.

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
All right.

199
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So if you've mapped out a plan, you don't want to screw it up.

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Screw it up.

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Screw it up.

203
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or screw up.

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yep.

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So to screw something up means that you made a mistake on something or you did something wrong.

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You did it wrong.

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yep.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So for example, if I'm taking an exam and I make a mistake, I screwed up on the exam.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Exactly.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Or for example, here, when we're recording, Marco and I make mistakes a lot.

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Maybe more me than Marco.

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We always screw up.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So to make a mistake, it's a really informal word, but very, very common.

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah.

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And you know, it sounds really, really natural when people use this.

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All right.

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So now let's take a look at our last word.

220
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Lose your cool.

221
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Lose your cool.

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't lose your cool.

223
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So what is this to lose your cool?

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a weird expression.

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's a weird expression.

226
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why don't we just give you an example of a person that loses his or her cool?

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What do you mean you're not ready to go?

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's time to go.

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We have to go now.

230
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Boninato.

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We were supposed to leave.

232
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Punieta.

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now we're sitting here again.

234
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to wait for you.

235
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Boninam.

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay.

237
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So basically you lose your temper.

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You become irritated.

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You lose control of your emotions, right?

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So Marco, when you lose your cool, is it always that you get angry?

241
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You don't always get angry.

242
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Maybe you get irritated or impatient or even nervous.

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Nervous.

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yep.

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right.

246
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So basically you're not in control of your emotions.

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah.

248
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

249
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So we've looked at a lot of great phrases, a lot of great words, so we can listen to our dialogue now for the third time, and then we'll come back and talk about this bank robbery business.

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
All right, so this is what we're going to do.

251
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I've carefully mapped this out, so don't screw it up.

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Mr.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Rabbit, you and Mr.

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Fox will go into the bank wearing these uniforms.

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We've managed to get replicas of the one the guards wear for when they pick up the money.

256
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Got it.

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No problem, boss.

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
When you get inside, tell them that you're filling in for Carl and Tom and say that they're on another route today.

259
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't lose your cool.

260
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Just act natural.

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What if they want to call and confirm?

262
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You let him.

263
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What?

264
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't worry.

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We have the phones tapped, so the call will be patched through to me, and I'll pretend to be the transport company.

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're so clever, boss.

267
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay, shut up.

268
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Only take as much money as you can fit in these bags.

269
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't get greedy.

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Are you ready?

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's go.

272
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So there's a lot of movies about bank robberies, but obviously they happen in real life.

273
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So this dialogue is actually based on real events, right?

274
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, this actually happened in real life.

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a violent way of robbing a bank.

276
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, so what happened?

277
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Basically, this guy went to a bank dressed up as one of those security guards that transport the money from the bank to another safe place.

278
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He had fake credentials or replica credentials.

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So fake ID?

280
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah, he had a replica of the uniform.

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wow.

282
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And he walked in, he took all these bags, him and his partner, and they took him to the truck and drove off, and the bank didn't realize that they had been robbed.

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They thought it was a routine thing.

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Three or four hours later, the real security guard shows up.

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They were long gone, and they still can't find them.

286
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Really?

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So a very clever plan.

288
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Very clever and very effective.

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think they stole over half a million dollars.

290
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Okay, well guys, don't try this at home.

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't try this at home but real life, real English, right?

292
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Exactly.

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay, so come to our website, leave your questions and comments.

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Tell us what you think will happen with these guys.

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Do you think they'll be successful?

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you think they'll get caught?

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, they might end up in jail.

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe somebody will lose their cool and get caught, right?

299
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Well, thanks for listening guys, and until next time, goodbye.
