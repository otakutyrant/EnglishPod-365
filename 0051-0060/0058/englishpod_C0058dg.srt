00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:13,000
EnglishPod.com And the next thing you know, we're running towards the...

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, did you feel that?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah, don't worry about it.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air, so we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is why I hate flying!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
At this time, I'd like to remind all of our passengers to fasten their seatbelts and remain seated until the Fasten Seatbelt sign is turned off.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Did you hear that?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Oh my God!

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Brent!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't worry about it.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is totally normal.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It happens all the...

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us, and so, for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seatbelt sign has been switched off.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We can expect...

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thanks for watching!
