00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:13,480
EnglishPod.com And the next thing you know, we're running towards the...

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,779
Oh, did you feel that?

3
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:17,260
Yeah, don't worry about it.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,760
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,719
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:26,899
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air, so we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,980
This is why I hate flying!

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,479
At this time, I'd like to remind all of our passengers to fasten their seatbelts and remain seated until the Fasten Seatbelt sign is turned off.

9
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,619
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,219
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

11
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,119
Did you hear that?

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,520
Oh my God!

13
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:44,140
Brent!

14
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:45,460
Don't worry about it.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,500
This is totally normal.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,740
It happens all the...

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,979
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,079
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us, and so, for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

19
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,439
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,719
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seatbelt sign has been switched off.

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,079
We can expect...

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,239
Thanks for watching!
