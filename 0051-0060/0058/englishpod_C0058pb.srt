00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we have a great lesson for all our upper intermediate students.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're talking about airplane travel today.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Airplane travel.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So we're going to be in an airplane.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And we're going to be listening to some of the common things you might hear on an announcement in the airplane.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yeah, usually the flight attendant or the captain will come on and say something and Well, usually it's in English, so we got to understand what they're saying.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And we'll also learn some great phrases that you can use when you want to describe flights to your friends when you're talking to them.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, that always happens.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You arrive somewhere and people are like, hey, how was your flight?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Now you know how to answer it.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Exactly.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview?

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, we've got three words for you here in vocabulary preview all about flying.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So what's our first one?

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Turbulence.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Turbulence.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Turbulence.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Turbulence.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So turbulence.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How can we describe this?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, turbulence when you're in an airplane basically is air that is moving in all directions really fast.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So what happens?

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So the airplane will start to shake.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's the same thing if you're flying a kite and maybe some turbulence is in the air, your kite will maybe fall to the ground.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So it's air that's moving in all directions.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's really turbulent.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, we'll hear how this word is used in the dialogue, but another airplane word we hear a lot.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Crew.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Crew.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Crew.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Flight crew.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
C-R-E-W.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Crew.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So the flight crew is basically the team.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Right?

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's all the people that are in the airplane.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So it's basically the captain and the co-pilot and all the flight attendants.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Exactly.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yep.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's the flight crew.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

59
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And what about our last word?

60
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bumpy ride.

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Bumpy ride.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A bumpy ride.

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Bumpy.

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Not smooth.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Not smooth.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

67
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So what would be an example of a bumpy ride?

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Imagine if you're driving in your car and you're driving on a dirt road, like with many holes in it and everything.

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And rocks.

70
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're driving on that road and it would be really, really bumpy.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Right.

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So your car will be moving a lot.

74
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And shaking.

75
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Exactly.

76
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So a bumpy ride is a trip where you move and shake a lot.

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's kind of uncomfortable.

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So you can say that is a bumpy road.

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Or it was a bumpy ride.

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It was a bumpy ride.

81
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah.

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

83
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So now let's listen to our dialogue.

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
We're going to be listening to these people on an airplane and the captain is going to give some instructions.

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the...

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh.

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Did you feel that?

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah.

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't worry about it.

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

92
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air, so we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is why I hate flying.

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
At this time, I'd like to remind all our passengers to fasten their seat belts and remain seated until the fasten seat belt sign is turned off.

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Did you hear that?

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Oh my God, Brent!

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't worry about it.

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is totally normal.

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It happens all the...

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us and so for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seat belt sign has been switched off.

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We can expect...

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Aah!

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Aah!

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Aah!

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, here we are with another dramatic dialogue, another explosion in EnglishPod.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's happening?

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A lot of adventure is going on, so we'll see what happens.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I'm sure they're all right.

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't worry, everyone.

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sure...

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, I hope so.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's kind of making me nervous for my next flight.

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So let's take a look at some of the words that the captain used in language takeaway.

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Language takeaway.

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All right.

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All of these words you'll hear really, really often when you're flying.

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And the first one we have for you is fasten.

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Fasten.

126
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Fasten.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Fasten your seat belt.

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mm-hmm.

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now this is a great word.

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fasten means to...

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Do up.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do up or put on or...

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Connect, right?

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So usually it'll be with a seat belt or a belt or something like that, right?

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now the pronunciation here is interesting.

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's spelt F-A-S-T-E-N.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Right, so it would be fasten.

139
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No.

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, right?

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Fasten.

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Fasten.

143
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The T kind of becomes silent.

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So it's fasten.

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yep.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's look at our next word.

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Lavatory.

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Lavatory.

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Lavatory.

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Lavatory.

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, so what is a lavatory exactly?

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Because I'm always confused.

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's the difference between bathroom, restroom, washroom, WC, lavatory?

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I know.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So many words for bathroom.

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A lavatory is a room with a toilet and sink only.

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Only a toilet and sink.

159
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So no bathtub.

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No shower either.

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No shower.

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So it's very, very common to find a lavatory in boats, airplanes, or trains.

164
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yep.

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But never in your house.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Never in your house, right?

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Even if your room in your house is only a sink and a toilet, it's still not a lavatory.

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a bathroom.

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay.

171
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know why.

172
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's just the way it is in English.

173
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And something interesting that you told me today, WC, right?

174
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's a common thing that you'll see on a bathroom.

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yep.

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What does that stand for?

177
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Water closet.

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Water closet.

179
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yep.

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wow, I didn't know that.

181
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

182
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Water closet.

183
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

184
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Anyways, let's take a look at our next word.

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Stow.

186
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stow.

187
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
To stow.

188
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

189
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Stow your luggage.

190
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Stow your luggage.

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mm-hmm.

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So if I stow my luggage, it means?

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You put it in a place where you can get it easily, but it is very safe.

194
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Maybe it's not even visible, right?

195
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

196
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you put it away in a safe spot.

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay.

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So usually in airplanes, they will tell you to stow your luggage under your seat.

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Or stow your luggage in the overhead bin.

201
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Overhead bin or overhead compartment.

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

203
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And our last word.

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Refrain.

206
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Refrain.

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Refrain.

208
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Refrain from doing something.

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So this is a verb meaning avoid doing.

211
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Avoid doing.

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Do not do.

213
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Exactly.

214
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Something interesting about this grammar-wise is it's usually followed by from.

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yep.

216
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Refrain from.

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And the verb that follows is always gerund, right?

218
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

219
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So refrain from I-N-G.

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Right.

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Refrain from using the lavatory.

222
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

223
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Refrain from smoking.

224
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Refrain from smoking.

225
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay.

226
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So refrain from.

227
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yep.

228
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
All right.

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So some really great examples in language takeaway.

230
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yep.

231
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And well, now let's take a look at Fluency Builder and see some of these great phrases.

232
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Fluency Builder.

233
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right.

234
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Three phrases we have for you here.

235
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The first one, remain seated.

236
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Remain seated.

237
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Remain seated.

238
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Remain seated.

239
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So to remain seated.

240
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Really simple, to stay sitting.

241
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
To stay on your seat.

242
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Don't stand up.

243
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is really important in airplanes, right?

245
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, because otherwise if there's turbulence, you could end up flying around the airplane.

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Or fall exactly and hurt yourself.

247
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Remain seated.

248
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now, one of the reasons they had to remain seated was because they were going to go through a patch of rough air.

249
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Patch of rough air.

250
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So patch.

251
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now, interesting.

252
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
OK.

253
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So patch is a small area, right?

254
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

255
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So a small area of turbulence.

256
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A small area of turbulence.

257
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Now, what would be another example of patch?

258
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Maybe a patch of strawberries.

259
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So it's like a little strawberry garden.

260
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

261
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Or a patch of grass.

262
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Patch of grass.

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Usually in front of your house, you'll have a little patch of grass.

264
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yep.

265
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
OK.

266
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So patch of.

267
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And now our last phrase.

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Suspend.

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Suspend.

270
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Suspend in-flight service.

271
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So stop for a short time.

272
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Stop for a short time.

273
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So you could suspend your work.

274
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yeah.

275
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And if you're going on vacation, you could suspend your subscription to the newspaper.

276
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
OK.

277
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So suspend to temporarily stop.

278
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

279
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OK.

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So we've covered a lot of vocabulary and some great phrases.

281
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk about flying.

282
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the oh.

283
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Did you feel that?

284
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

285
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry about it.

286
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

288
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air, so we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

289
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is why I hate flying.

290
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
At this time, I'd like to remind all our passengers to fasten their seatbelts and remain seated until the fasten seatbelt sign is turned off.

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

292
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

293
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Did you hear that?

294
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, my God.

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Brent!

296
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't worry about it.

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is totally normal.

298
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It happens all the...

299
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

300
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us.

301
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And so for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seatbelt sign has been switched off.

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We can expect...

305
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Erica, have you ever had a turbulent flight like this?

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No, never this bad.

307
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A little bit of turbulence.

308
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Actually, I kind of like turbulent flights.

309
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's sort of like...

310
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know.

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's kind of fun.

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You get shaken around.

313
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Your stomach moves up and down.

314
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You don't get nervous?

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I get a little excited.

316
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, it is true that flying is actually very, very safe, right?

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

318
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I know we all hear that more people are killed in car accidents than flight accidents.

319
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So it's very, very safe.

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So yeah.

321
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't worry about the turbulence.

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Knock on wood.

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah.

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So flying is really safe.

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And as long as you remain seated, you fasten your seatbelt, and you follow the instructions, you shouldn't have any problems.

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

327
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah.

328
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Actually, that's a really good point.

329
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Because actually, when I was reading about flight turbulence for this dialogue, I kept reading all these stories about these people who, when they got into some turbulent air, were knocked over or they ended up actually literally flying through the cabin and getting really badly hurt.

330
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

331
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Everyone, you've got to fasten your seatbelt.

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Remain seated.

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

334
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000

We don't want you to get hurt.

337

And we know that you travel a lot, so be safe, right?

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And use this language to describe your flight.

340
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay.

341
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000

343

Marco and I are always there.

344
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And actually, in fact, we have to go check the site now.

345
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So yeah.

346
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
We're out of time.

347
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So we'll see you guys next time.

348
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Thanks for listening.

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Bye.
