00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:05,599
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,360
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,580
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,560
And today we have a great lesson for all our upper intermediate students.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,220
That's right.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,099
We're talking about airplane travel today.

7
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:14,980
Airplane travel.

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:15,539
Right.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,399
So we're going to be in an airplane.

10
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:17,839
Yes.

11
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,219
And we're going to be listening to some of the common things you might hear on an announcement in the airplane.

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,199
Yeah, usually the flight attendant or the captain will come on and say something and Well, usually it's in English, so we got to understand what they're saying.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:31,780
That's right.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,619
And we'll also learn some great phrases that you can use when you want to describe flights to your friends when you're talking to them.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,780
Yeah, that always happens.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,600
You arrive somewhere and people are like, hey, how was your flight?

17
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,299
Now you know how to answer it.

18
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:43,619
Exactly.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,219
Okay.

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,119
So why don't we take a look at our vocabulary preview?

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,259
Vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:55,840
Well, we've got three words for you here in vocabulary preview all about flying.

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:56,479
Okay.

24
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,460
So what's our first one?

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,479
Turbulence.

26
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,759
Turbulence.

27
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,520
Turbulence.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,759
Turbulence.

29
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,280
So turbulence.

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,060
How can we describe this?

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,180
Well, turbulence when you're in an airplane basically is air that is moving in all directions really fast.

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,459
Okay.

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,180
So what happens?

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,780
So the airplane will start to shake.

35
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:16,439
Okay.

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,739
Right.

37
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:17,120
Yeah.

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,340
It's the same thing if you're flying a kite and maybe some turbulence is in the air, your kite will maybe fall to the ground.

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,739
So it's air that's moving in all directions.

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,900
It's really turbulent.

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:28,560
All right.

42
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,459
Well, we'll hear how this word is used in the dialogue, but another airplane word we hear a lot.

43
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:35,480
Crew.

44
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:36,079
Crew.

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:36,620
Crew.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,560
Flight crew.

47
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,079
C-R-E-W.

48
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:39,519
Crew.

49
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,500
So the flight crew is basically the team.

50
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:43,920
Yes.

51
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:44,340
Right?

52
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,760
It's all the people that are in the airplane.

53
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:53,019
So it's basically the captain and the co-pilot and all the flight attendants.

54
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:53,560
Exactly.

55
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:53,939
Yep.

56
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,680
That's the flight crew.

57
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,260
Yes.

58
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:57,299
Okay.

59
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,140
And what about our last word?

60
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,519
Bumpy ride.

61
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:01,659
Bumpy ride.

62
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,640
A bumpy ride.

63
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,519
Bumpy.

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,180
Not smooth.

65
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,180
Not smooth.

66
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:06,480
Yeah.

67
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,020
So what would be an example of a bumpy ride?

68
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,340
Imagine if you're driving in your car and you're driving on a dirt road, like with many holes in it and everything.

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:16,800
And rocks.

70
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,180
Yes.

71
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,639
You're driving on that road and it would be really, really bumpy.

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:20,879
Right.

73
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,639
So your car will be moving a lot.

74
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,099
And shaking.

75
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:23,699
Exactly.

76
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,479
So a bumpy ride is a trip where you move and shake a lot.

77
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,520
It's kind of uncomfortable.

78
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,780
So you can say that is a bumpy road.

79
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,620
Or it was a bumpy ride.

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,500
It was a bumpy ride.

81
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:34,800
Yeah.

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,360
Okay.

83
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,560
So now let's listen to our dialogue.

84
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,699
We're going to be listening to these people on an airplane and the captain is going to give some instructions.

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,159
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the...

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:58,460
Oh.

87
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,280
Did you feel that?

88
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,060
Yeah.

89
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,819
Don't worry about it.

90
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,240
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

91
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,259
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

92
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:11,419
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air, so we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

93
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,479
This is why I hate flying.

94
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,039
At this time, I'd like to remind all our passengers to fasten their seat belts and remain seated until the fasten seat belt sign is turned off.

95
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,159
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

96
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,759
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

97
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:26,639
Did you hear that?

98
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,639
Oh my God, Brent!

99
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,020
Don't worry about it.

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,039
This is totally normal.

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,379
It happens all the...

102
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:35,539
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

103
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:41,620
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us and so for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

104
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:44,979
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

105
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,460
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seat belt sign has been switched off.

106
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,400
We can expect...

107
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,080
Aah!

108
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,620
Aah!

109
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,599
Aah!

110
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:21,500
Well, here we are with another dramatic dialogue, another explosion in EnglishPod.

111
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,199
What's happening?

112
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:23,879
I don't know.

113
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,000
A lot of adventure is going on, so we'll see what happens.

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,839
But I'm sure they're all right.

115
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,620
Don't worry, everyone.

116
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,139
I'm sure...

117
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:30,500
Well, I hope so.

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,579
It's kind of making me nervous for my next flight.

119
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:33,860
All right.

120
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,920
So let's take a look at some of the words that the captain used in language takeaway.

121
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,839
Language takeaway.

122
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,100
All right.

123
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,199
All of these words you'll hear really, really often when you're flying.

124
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,720
And the first one we have for you is fasten.

125
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:50,639
Fasten.

126
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,639
Fasten.

127
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,319
Fasten your seat belt.

128
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,540
Mm-hmm.

129
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,579
Now this is a great word.

130
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,139
Fasten means to...

131
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:57,480
Do up.

132
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,500
Do up or put on or...

133
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,319
Connect, right?

134
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,480
So usually it'll be with a seat belt or a belt or something like that, right?

135
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,699
Now the pronunciation here is interesting.

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,139
Yes.

137
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,939
It's spelt F-A-S-T-E-N.

138
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,980
Right, so it would be fasten.

139
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:13,639
No.

140
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:14,439
No, right?

141
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,540
Fasten.

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,319
Fasten.

143
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,319
The T kind of becomes silent.

144
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,079
So it's fasten.

145
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:21,439
Yep.

146
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:22,379
Okay.

147
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:23,899
Let's look at our next word.

148
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,199
Lavatory.

149
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,660
Lavatory.

150
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:27,459
Lavatory.

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:28,920
Lavatory.

152
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,079
Okay, so what is a lavatory exactly?

153
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,019
Because I'm always confused.

154
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,560
What's the difference between bathroom, restroom, washroom, WC, lavatory?

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,279
I know.

156
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,759
So many words for bathroom.

157
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,160
A lavatory is a room with a toilet and sink only.

158
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,240
Only a toilet and sink.

159
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,120
So no bathtub.

160
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:48,639
No.

161
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:49,839
No shower either.

162
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:50,560
No shower.

163
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:57,439
So it's very, very common to find a lavatory in boats, airplanes, or trains.

164
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:57,720
Yep.

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
But never in your house.

166
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,019
Never in your house, right?

167
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,579
Even if your room in your house is only a sink and a toilet, it's still not a lavatory.

168
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,339
It's a bathroom.

169
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,720
Yeah.

170
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,560
Okay.

171
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,480
I don't know why.

172
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,519
That's just the way it is in English.

173
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,100
And something interesting that you told me today, WC, right?

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,060
That's a common thing that you'll see on a bathroom.

175
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:16,360
Yep.

176
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,540
What does that stand for?

177
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,500
Water closet.

178
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,560
Water closet.

179
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:19,779
Yep.

180
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,319
Wow, I didn't know that.

181
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,720
Yeah.

182
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,519
Water closet.

183
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,500
Okay.

184
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,079
Anyways, let's take a look at our next word.

185
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,240
Stow.

186
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:28,160
Stow.

187
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,180
To stow.

188
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:29,639
Yes.

189
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,639
Stow your luggage.

190
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,800
Stow your luggage.

191
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:32,339
Mm-hmm.

192
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,660
So if I stow my luggage, it means?

193
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,180
You put it in a place where you can get it easily, but it is very safe.

194
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,300
Maybe it's not even visible, right?

195
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:41,660
Yeah.

196
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,560
So you put it away in a safe spot.

197
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:43,939
Okay.

198
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,680
So usually in airplanes, they will tell you to stow your luggage under your seat.

199
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes.

200
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,339
Or stow your luggage in the overhead bin.

201
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,279
Overhead bin or overhead compartment.

202
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:54,699
Yes.

203
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:55,620
Okay.

204
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,819
And our last word.

205
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,000
Refrain.

206
00:06:59,339 --> 00:06:59,939
Refrain.

207
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:00,800
Refrain.

208
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,620
Refrain from doing something.

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,079
Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,540
So this is a verb meaning avoid doing.

211
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:07,240
Avoid doing.

212
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:07,959
Do not do.

213
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,500
Exactly.

214
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,720
Something interesting about this grammar-wise is it's usually followed by from.

215
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,160
Yep.

216
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,319
Refrain from.

217
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,540
And the verb that follows is always gerund, right?

218
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:17,759
Yeah.

219
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,019
So refrain from I-N-G.

220
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:20,620
Right.

221
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,819
Refrain from using the lavatory.

222
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:24,160
Yes.

223
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,759
Refrain from smoking.

224
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,240
Refrain from smoking.

225
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:27,699
Okay.

226
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,160
So refrain from.

227
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,579
Yep.

228
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,199
All right.

229
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:32,779
So some really great examples in language takeaway.

230
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,240
Yep.

231
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,139
And well, now let's take a look at Fluency Builder and see some of these great phrases.

232
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:40,600
Fluency Builder.

233
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:41,759
All right.

234
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,899
Three phrases we have for you here.

235
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,879
The first one, remain seated.

236
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,579
Remain seated.

237
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:49,500
Remain seated.

238
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,699
Remain seated.

239
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,639
So to remain seated.

240
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,459
Really simple, to stay sitting.

241
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,180
To stay on your seat.

242
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:57,920
Don't stand up.

243
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,240
Yes.

244
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:00,500
This is really important in airplanes, right?

245
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Yeah, because otherwise if there's turbulence, you could end up flying around the airplane.

246
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,639
Or fall exactly and hurt yourself.

247
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,100
Remain seated.

248
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:17,459
Now, one of the reasons they had to remain seated was because they were going to go through a patch of rough air.

249
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,199
Patch of rough air.

250
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:20,319
So patch.

251
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,500
Now, interesting.

252
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,819
OK.

253
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,019
So patch is a small area, right?

254
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:25,860
Yeah.

255
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,600
So a small area of turbulence.

256
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,620
A small area of turbulence.

257
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,740
Now, what would be another example of patch?

258
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,019
Maybe a patch of strawberries.

259
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,539
So it's like a little strawberry garden.

260
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:37,960
Yes.

261
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,659
Or a patch of grass.

262
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,600
Patch of grass.

263
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,379
Usually in front of your house, you'll have a little patch of grass.

264
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:43,740
Yep.

265
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:44,360
OK.

266
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,220
So patch of.

267
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,039
And now our last phrase.

268
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,159
Suspend.

269
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,519
Suspend.

270
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,799
Suspend in-flight service.

271
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:54,419
So stop for a short time.

272
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,399
Stop for a short time.

273
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,559
So you could suspend your work.

274
00:08:58,899 --> 00:08:59,080
Yeah.

275
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,519
And if you're going on vacation, you could suspend your subscription to the newspaper.

276
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,019
OK.

277
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,220
So suspend to temporarily stop.

278
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:07,620
Yes.

279
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:08,259
OK.

280
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,840
So we've covered a lot of vocabulary and some great phrases.

281
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,080
So why don't we listen to our dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk about flying.

282
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,360
And the next thing you know, we're running towards the oh.

283
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,220
Did you feel that?

284
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:32,940
Yeah.

285
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:33,720
Don't worry about it.

286
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,200
We're just going through a bit of turbulence.

287
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,139
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

288
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,299
It looks like we've hit a patch of rough air, so we're going to have a bit of a bumpy ride for the next several minutes.

289
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,399
This is why I hate flying.

290
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,940
At this time, I'd like to remind all our passengers to fasten their seatbelts and remain seated until the fasten seatbelt sign is turned off.

291
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,059
Please ensure that all cabin baggage is carefully stowed under the seat in front of you.

292
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,620
I'll be back to update you in a minute.

293
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,539
Did you hear that?

294
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,960
Oh, my God.

295
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:00,600
Brent!

296
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:01,899
Don't worry about it.

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,919
This is totally normal.

298
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,400
It happens all the...

299
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,419
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain again.

300
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,159
We've got quite a large patch of rough air ahead of us.

301
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,500
And so for your safety, we will be suspending in-flight service.

302
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,860
I would ask all the in-flight crew to return to their seats at this time.

303
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,179
I would also ask that all our passengers refrain from using the lavatory until the seatbelt sign has been switched off.

304
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,539
We can expect...

305
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,759
Erica, have you ever had a turbulent flight like this?

306
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,120
No, never this bad.

307
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,000
A little bit of turbulence.

308
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,840
Actually, I kind of like turbulent flights.

309
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,639
It's sort of like...

310
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:55,980
I don't know.

311
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:56,639
It's kind of fun.

312
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,600
You get shaken around.

313
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,419
Your stomach moves up and down.

314
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,299
You don't get nervous?

315
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I get a little excited.

316
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,919
Well, it is true that flying is actually very, very safe, right?

317
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,419
Yeah.

318
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,559
I know we all hear that more people are killed in car accidents than flight accidents.

319
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,340
So it's very, very safe.

320
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,220
So yeah.

321
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't worry about the turbulence.

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Knock on wood.

323
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:18,720
Yeah.

324
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,179
So flying is really safe.

325
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:26,960
And as long as you remain seated, you fasten your seatbelt, and you follow the instructions, you shouldn't have any problems.

326
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,340
Yeah.

327
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,639
Yeah.

328
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:28,840
Actually, that's a really good point.

329
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:46,600
Because actually, when I was reading about flight turbulence for this dialogue, I kept reading all these stories about these people who, when they got into some turbulent air, were knocked over or they ended up actually literally flying through the cabin and getting really badly hurt.

330
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,559
Yeah.

331
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,240
Everyone, you've got to fasten your seatbelt.

332
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,519
Remain seated.

333
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

334
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,700

335
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,100

And we know that you travel a lot, so be safe, right?

338
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:58,159
Yeah.

339
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,879
And use this language to describe your flight.

340
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:01,480
Okay.

341
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,419

Marco and I are always there.

344
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:11,360
And actually, in fact, we have to go check the site now.

345
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,059
So yeah.

346
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:13,100
We're out of time.

347
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,419
So we'll see you guys next time.

348
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,159
Thanks for listening.

349
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,539
Bye.
