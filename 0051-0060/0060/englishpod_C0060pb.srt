00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're bringing you our great suspense scary series.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Our thriller.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Our thriller, New Guy in Town Part 4.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Alright, well, I don't want to give you any hints about what will happen in this dialogue.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, it's totally unexpected.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's listen to our dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about some of the great vocabulary.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Look, she's waking up.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's going on, Ellen?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What are you doing?

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The cat's out of the bag, you witch!

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can stop pretending now.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, Lois.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We know who you are.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now, we want some answers.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why are you here?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hahahaha!

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fools!

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You don't know who you're dealing with.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can't stop me!

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Run!

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't know.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, I certainly didn't see that one coming.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone thought that Armand was a vampire.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And now it turns out that they were acting.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, crazy.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Crazy, huh?

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Strange things happen here on EnglishPod.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright, so why don't we take a look at some of the language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, we have three words for you here that we heard in the dialogue.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And the first one, Armand tells Ellen to drag her over here.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right, drag.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Drag.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, when you drag something, or somebody.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You pull them across the floor, or pull them across the ground.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Pull them, but you don't actually pick them up, right?

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right?

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Their body is still touching the ground.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, so just imagine if you have a really heavy suitcase, it doesn't have any wheels, you gotta drag it across the floor.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, I've been there.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, it's happened to me too.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So, drag.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Alright, and then he says, tie her up.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Tie her up.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Tie somebody up.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, to tie somebody up.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To use rope and put it around a person so that they cannot move.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So, you take rope, you tie a person up.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And it's always used like this, right?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tie somebody up.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Tie him up.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Tie that up.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tie that up.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And our last word.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I like this one.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Fools.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Fools.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fools.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So, our singular would be fool.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah, F-O-O-L.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, what's a fool?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, a fool is a stupid person.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Right, a person that doesn't know something or an ignorant person.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Alright, well, Lois thinks that Armand and Ellen are fools here.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Apparently, she got really angry and managed to escape from the chair or whatever.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She was tied up, right?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, the dialogue was a little bit fast.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There was a lot of sound effects as well.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yep.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So, let's listen to this dialogue again.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I'm sure it's going to be a little bit easier to understand.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Alright, drag her over here and help me tie her up.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't believe she fell for it.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Whatever.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was the one that convinced her to come.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Look, she's waking up.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's going on, Ellen?

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you doing?

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can stop pretending now.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, Lois, we know who you are.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now, we want some answers.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you here?

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hahahaha!

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Fools!

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You don't know who you're dealing with.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You can't stop me.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Run!

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, Marco, I noticed in this dialogue there's a lot of words and phrases that we can use to talk about lying or fooling somebody.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Exactly.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There is a lot of language about lying.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So, let's take a look at it in Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Fluency Builder Alright, so, in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at four phrases.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The first one, fell for it.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Fell for it.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't believe she fell for it.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Fell for it.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, so it's not that she physically fell, right?

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, no.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But she believed the lie.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She believed the lie.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You fell for the lie.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know that we have some examples so we can understand this phrase, fell for it, a little bit better.

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Example one.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You might seem like a nice guy, but don't fall for it.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He's a jerk.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Example two.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I can't believe I fell for your lies.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Example three.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I told my mom I was going to the library and she fell for it.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Alright, well, that's a lot clearer to me.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I noticed that we have the preposition it here.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, it is at the end and it's referring to the lie.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Or the joke or the story.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She fell for the story, but you wouldn't say she fell for the story.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You would say she fell for it.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, so these three words always, always, always go together.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Fell for it.

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So don't forget the it.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't forget the it.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, let's take a look at our second word.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Gullible.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So Ellen thinks that Lois was gullible.

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right, a gullible person.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, gullible.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A gullible person is somebody that always believes.

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, they always fall for it.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They always fall for it.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
They believe anything you say.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So I know you were a little bit gullible when you were younger, right?

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know what?

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
My grandmother used to tell me every year, she would say, oh, I'm 35.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm 35.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And I really believed her until I was about 12 years old.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Wow, so you were really gullible.

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Really gullible.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But you're not anymore.

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
No, I know better.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
All right, so gullible.

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
A gullible person.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, now let's look at the next phrase.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The cat's out of the bag.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The cat is out of the bag.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The cat is out of the bag.

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay, so again, it's not literal.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not like you had a cat in a bag and you let it out, right?

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A nice idiom here meaning the truth is out.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The truth is out.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We discovered the truth.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, so imagine that the cat is the truth.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right, and it escaped.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, so the cat's out of the bag.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The truth is out.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We know the truth now.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yep.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

172
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And our last phrase, pretending.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Pretending.

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Pretending.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So Lois was pretending to be a normal housewife.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's listen to some examples of how we would use pretending.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Example one.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Pretend that you're my boyfriend and he'll go away.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Example two.

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't believe Lucy pretended to be sick.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Example three.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You forgot my birthday.

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't pretend that everything is okay.

184
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay, so pretending is acting like you are somebody that you are not.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, or yeah, it's sort of like acting a lie.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, so for example, on Halloween everyone dresses up as a monster or Spiderman or something.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So everyone pretends to be that character.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

189
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But they are not.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes.

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, pretending.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
To pretend.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, so let's listen to her dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk some more.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Alright, drag her over here and help me tie her up.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't believe she fell for it.

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

198
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant.

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Whatever, I was the one that convinced her to come.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Look, she's waking up.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What's going on, Ellen?

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you doing?

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can stop pretending now.

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, Lois, we know who you are.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now we want some answers.

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why are you here?

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Fools, you don't know who you're dealing with.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can't stop me.

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Run!

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, so what do you think will happen in part five?

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have no idea.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, what do you guys think will happen in part five?

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Apparently, Armand isn't a vampire anymore.

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But Lois is a witch.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But Lois is a witch.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Who's Ellen?

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What sort of twist are we gonna see here?

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Is she an alien?

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh my god.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
