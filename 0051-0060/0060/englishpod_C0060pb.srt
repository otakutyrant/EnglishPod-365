00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,480
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,280
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:07,540
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,119
And today we're bringing you our great suspense scary series.

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:12,839
Our thriller.

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,880
Our thriller, New Guy in Town Part 4.

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,980
Alright, well, I don't want to give you any hints about what will happen in this dialogue.

9
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:22,879
Yes, it's totally unexpected.

10
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:28,500
So let's listen to our dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about some of the great vocabulary.

11
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
Look, she's waking up.

12
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,920
What's going on, Ellen?

13
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,420
What are you doing?

14
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,340
The cat's out of the bag, you witch!

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,120
You can stop pretending now.

16
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,040
Yeah, Lois.

17
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,760
We know who you are.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,540
Now, we want some answers.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,040
Why are you here?

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,780
Hahahaha!

21
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:30,400
Fools!

22
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,379
You don't know who you're dealing with.

23
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,200
You can't stop me!

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,319
Run!

25
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,620
I didn't know.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:57,079
Well, I certainly didn't see that one coming.

27
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,719
I know.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone thought that Armand was a vampire.

29
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,060
I know.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
And now it turns out that they were acting.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
Yeah, crazy.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,060
Crazy, huh?

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,980
Strange things happen here on EnglishPod.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,180
Alright, so why don't we take a look at some of the language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:17,699 --> 00:02:21,280
Well, we have three words for you here that we heard in the dialogue.

36
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:28,639
And the first one, Armand tells Ellen to drag her over here.

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,060
Right, drag.

38
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:30,840
Drag.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,120
So, when you drag something, or somebody.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,439
You pull them across the floor, or pull them across the ground.

41
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,819
Pull them, but you don't actually pick them up, right?

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:41,439
Right?

43
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,599
Their body is still touching the ground.

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,259
Okay, so just imagine if you have a really heavy suitcase, it doesn't have any wheels, you gotta drag it across the floor.

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,620
Yeah, I've been there.

46
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,199
Yeah, it's happened to me too.

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,699
So, drag.

48
00:02:56,339 --> 00:03:00,060
Alright, and then he says, tie her up.

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,699
Tie her up.

50
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,439
Tie somebody up.

51
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,259
So, to tie somebody up.

52
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,099
To use rope and put it around a person so that they cannot move.

53
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,639
So, you take rope, you tie a person up.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,139
And it's always used like this, right?

55
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,500
Tie somebody up.

56
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:17,900
Yes.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,960
Tie him up.

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
Tie that up.

59
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,080
Tie that up.

60
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:21,280
Yeah.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,659
Okay.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,419
And our last word.

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,659
I like this one.

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,620
Fools.

65
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:26,939
Fools.

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:27,740
Fools.

67
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,780
So, our singular would be fool.

68
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,199
Yeah, F-O-O-L.

69
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,599
So, what's a fool?

70
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,159
Well, a fool is a stupid person.

71
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:40,219
Right, a person that doesn't know something or an ignorant person.

72
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,340
Alright, well, Lois thinks that Armand and Ellen are fools here.

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,819
Apparently, she got really angry and managed to escape from the chair or whatever.

74
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,240
She was tied up, right?

75
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,159
Well, the dialogue was a little bit fast.

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,419
There was a lot of sound effects as well.

77
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:56,780
Yep.

78
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,280
So, let's listen to this dialogue again.

79
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,060
We're going to slow it down a little bit.

80
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:03,900
And I'm sure it's going to be a little bit easier to understand.

81
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,919
Alright, drag her over here and help me tie her up.

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,759
I can't believe she fell for it.

83
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,120
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,980
Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant.

85
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,980
Whatever.

86
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,800
I was the one that convinced her to come.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,220
Look, she's waking up.

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,339
What's going on, Ellen?

89
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,079
What are you doing?

90
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,279
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

91
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,779
You can stop pretending now.

92
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,639
Yeah, Lois, we know who you are.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,180
Now, we want some answers.

94
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:48,079
Why are you here?

95
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:50,839
Hahahaha!

96
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,199
Fools!

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,240
You don't know who you're dealing with.

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
You can't stop me.

99
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,639
Run!

100
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:10,060
Well, Marco, I noticed in this dialogue there's a lot of words and phrases that we can use to talk about lying or fooling somebody.

101
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:10,899
Exactly.

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,540
There is a lot of language about lying.

103
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,079
So, let's take a look at it in Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,759
Fluency Builder Alright, so, in Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at four phrases.

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,860
The first one, fell for it.

106
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,279
Fell for it.

107
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,259
I can't believe she fell for it.

108
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,779
Fell for it.

109
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,180
Okay, so it's not that she physically fell, right?

110
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,019
No, no.

111
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:38,579
But she believed the lie.

112
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,819
She believed the lie.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
You fell for the lie.

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,000
I know that we have some examples so we can understand this phrase, fell for it, a little bit better.

115
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,740
Example one.

116
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,420
You might seem like a nice guy, but don't fall for it.

117
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,000
He's a jerk.

118
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,259
Example two.

119
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,120
I can't believe I fell for your lies.

120
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:05,740
Example three.

121
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:10,560
I told my mom I was going to the library and she fell for it.

122
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,779
Alright, well, that's a lot clearer to me.

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,579
I noticed that we have the preposition it here.

124
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,500
Yeah, it is at the end and it's referring to the lie.

125
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes.

126
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,879
Or the joke or the story.

127
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,600
She fell for the story, but you wouldn't say she fell for the story.

128
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,360
You would say she fell for it.

129
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,660
Yeah, so these three words always, always, always go together.

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,220
Fell for it.

131
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,819
So don't forget the it.

132
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,160
Don't forget the it.

133
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,879
Okay, let's take a look at our second word.

134
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,259
Gullible.

135
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,920
So Ellen thinks that Lois was gullible.

136
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:47,819
Right, a gullible person.

137
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,680
Yeah, gullible.

138
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,980
A gullible person is somebody that always believes.

139
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,819
Yes, they always fall for it.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,779
They always fall for it.

141
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:55,980
Yeah.

142
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,240
They believe anything you say.

143
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,660
So I know you were a little bit gullible when you were younger, right?

144
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah, that's true.

145
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,199
You know what?

146
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,879
My grandmother used to tell me every year, she would say, oh, I'm 35.

147
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,399
I'm 35.

148
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,540
And I really believed her until I was about 12 years old.

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,300
Wow, so you were really gullible.

150
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,220
Really gullible.

151
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:15,939
But you're not anymore.

152
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,100
No, I know better.

153
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,279
All right, so gullible.

154
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,199
A gullible person.

155
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,220
Okay, now let's look at the next phrase.

156
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,759
The cat's out of the bag.

157
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,259
The cat is out of the bag.

158
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,639
The cat is out of the bag.

159
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,120
Okay, so again, it's not literal.

160
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,639
It's not like you had a cat in a bag and you let it out, right?

161
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,519
A nice idiom here meaning the truth is out.

162
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,439
The truth is out.

163
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,620
We discovered the truth.

164
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:45,040
Yes, so imagine that the cat is the truth.

165
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,319
Right, and it escaped.

166
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:46,819
Yes.

167
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,160
Okay, so the cat's out of the bag.

168
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
The truth is out.

169
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,040
We know the truth now.

170
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:52,480
Yep.

171
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,680
Okay.

172
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,079
And our last phrase, pretending.

173
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:58,419
Pretending.

174
00:07:59,379 --> 00:07:59,959
Pretending.

175
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,560
So Lois was pretending to be a normal housewife.

176
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,420
Let's listen to some examples of how we would use pretending.

177
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,339
Example one.

178
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,800
Pretend that you're my boyfriend and he'll go away.

179
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,879
Example two.

180
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,839
I can't believe Lucy pretended to be sick.

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,060
Example three.

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,899
You forgot my birthday.

183
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,139
Don't pretend that everything is okay.

184
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,379
Okay, so pretending is acting like you are somebody that you are not.

185
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,299
Yes, or yeah, it's sort of like acting a lie.

186
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,399
Okay, so for example, on Halloween everyone dresses up as a monster or Spiderman or something.

187
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,159
So everyone pretends to be that character.

188
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,580
Yes.

189
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,419
But they are not.

190
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:50,919
Yes.

191
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,720
Okay, pretending.

192
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,620
To pretend.

193
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,159
Yes.

194
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, so let's listen to her dialogue one more time and then we'll come back and talk some more.

195
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,659
Alright, drag her over here and help me tie her up.

196
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,779
I can't believe she fell for it.

197
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,539
She is a lot more gullible than I thought.

198
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,759
Well, you gotta admit, my acting was brilliant.

199
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,799
Whatever, I was the one that convinced her to come.

200
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,039
Look, she's waking up.

201
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,519
What's going on, Ellen?

202
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you doing?

203
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,919
The cat's out of the bag, you witch.

204
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,700
You can stop pretending now.

205
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,320
Yeah, Lois, we know who you are.

206
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,120
Now we want some answers.

207
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,639
Why are you here?

208
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:04,080
Fools, you don't know who you're dealing with.

209
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,799
You can't stop me.

210
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:06,919
Run!

211
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,940
Okay, so what do you think will happen in part five?

212
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,620
I have no idea.

213
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,080
Well, what do you guys think will happen in part five?

214
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,620
Apparently, Armand isn't a vampire anymore.

215
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,059
But Lois is a witch.

216
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
But Lois is a witch.

217
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,960
Who's Ellen?

218
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,600
What sort of twist are we gonna see here?

219
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,580
Is she an alien?

220
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,460
Oh my god.

221
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:46,820
