1
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,179
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,040
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:07,099
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,619
And today we're going to be bringing you another great sports lesson.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,179
Yes, this one is for all our hockey fans.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,879
I know we have a lot of listeners from Russia, so this is a very popular sport in Russia, Czech Republic.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,620
Yes, and Canada.

9
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,859
And Canada, right?

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,579
Very, very popular in Canada.

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,140
It's our national game.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,100
Well, I guess because you guys have so much ice.

13
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:30,399
I know, there's nothing else to do.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,980
Skiing and hockey.

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,320
All right, so it's going to be a really fun lesson.

16
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,359
We're going to have a lot of great vocabularies.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,679
So before we start in the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,039
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,299
Well, we have three words for you now.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,740
The first one, really simple, puck.

21
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:51,759
Puck.

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,579
Puck.

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:53,520
Puck.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,060
P-U-C-K.

25
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:55,799
Puck.

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,140
So it's almost like duck, but with a P.

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,799
And this is actually kind of like the ball that you use in hockey.

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,120
But it's not a ball.

29
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,980
But it's not a ball.

30
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,579
It's flat.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,500
It's flat.

32
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,120
And round.

33
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,900
And round.

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,079
So it looks like a disc.

35
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,859
Kind of like a mini frisbee.

36
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:12,459
Yes.

37
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,180
And this is what the players do.

38
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,280
This is what they...

39
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,299
They chase this around.

40
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,019
They chase it, right?

41
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,099
So in basketball you have a ball, in soccer you have a ball, in hockey you have a puck.

42
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,140
Okay, our next word.

43
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,280
Key game.

44
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,060
A key game.

45
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,120
A key game.

46
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:30,739
So this word key.

47
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:31,780
Important.

48
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,439
It means important, right?

49
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:33,980
Really important.

50
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,819
So I can say a key game is a really important game.

51
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:38,319
Exactly.

52
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:41,500
You could also maybe say a key player.

53
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,599
A key player is a really important player.

54
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,980
Or even a key goal.

55
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,040
A key goal.

56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:47,599
Okay.

57
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,340
So let's take a look at our last word now.

58
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,299
Finals.

59
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,599
Finals.

60
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:53,819
Finals.

61
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:54,680
The finals.

62
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,560
So the finals are the last games.

63
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,239
That's right.

64
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,099
And the winner of the finals wins the championship.

65
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:03,920
Okay.

66
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:09,159
For example, in the World Cup in soccer, there's only one game played in the finals.

67
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,960
So after everyone gets eliminated, there's one game where the winner is the champion.

68
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:13,419
Yes.

69
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,139
Okay.

70
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,479
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue.

71
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,340
And it's gonna be a little bit faster than usual.

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,360
Because it's a sports commentator, right?

73
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,939
It's exciting.

74
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,719
And it's exciting and there's a lot of action.

75
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,840
So don't worry about it.

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,939
Listen to it, and then we'll come back and talk about some of the vocabulary.

77
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,699
Hello everyone.

78
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,780
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

80
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,840
You know, Rick, today's a key game between Russia and Canada.

81
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:04,520
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

82
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:05,659
That's right.

83
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,159
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

84
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,659
The ref is calling the players for the faceoff.

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,060
And here we go.

86
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,199
The Russians win possession and immediately start up their attack.

87
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

88
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,319
Boris Ryszow has the puck now.

89
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,379
And he passes it to Sender.

90
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:21,860
He shoots.

91
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,900
Wow, what a save by the goalie.

92
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,039
Alright, the puck is back in play now.

93
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,639
Pavel Bory is on a breakaway.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,500
He is flying down the ice.

95
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,240
The defenders can't keep up.

96
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,159
Slap shot.

97
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,060
He scores.

98
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,099
What an amazing goal.

99
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,759
Alright, so the Canadians versus the Russians, huh?

100
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,620
It reminds me of a classic, classic game.

101
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,180
Exactly.

102
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,439
The classic match.

103
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:52,819
Yep.

104
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,500
So let's take a look at some of the vocabulary that we heard in the dialogue in Language Takeaway.

105
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,000
We have five phrases in Language Takeaway today.

106
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:07,020
And the first one is faceoff.

107
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,259
Faceoff.

108
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,180
Faceoff.

109
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,280
Faceoff.

110
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,400
So Marco, a faceoff here is a noun, right?

111
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,199
It's a noun.

112
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,840
Exactly.

113
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,850
And it's, so in the beginning of a match, the two players will stand face to face.

114
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,209
Yes.

115
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:20,449
Right?

116
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,230
That's why it's called kind of a faceoff.

117
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,470
And the referee will drop the puck.

118
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:24,870
Yes.

119
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,990
And they'll try to get it.

120
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,290
Exactly.

121
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,689
So that's the faceoff.

122
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:28,449
That's the faceoff.

123
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:28,709
Yep.

124
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,769
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

125
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:32,769
Check.

126
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,670
Check.

127
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:35,089
To check.

128
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:36,170
To check.

129
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:38,509
So an interesting verb here, hey?

130
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:44,509
Yeah, it's really interesting because it's different from the way that you would say check or revise, right?

131
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:44,750
Yes.

132
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,069
Yep.

133
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,410
This is actually kind of a violent move.

134
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,029
Yeah.

135
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,129
So what do you do?

136
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,589
So basically in hockey, you take your body and you hit another person with it.

137
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,649
Okay, so to check someone is to hit them with your body.

138
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,269
With your body, right.

139
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,329
You can't use your arms or your legs or your hands.

140
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:06,389
You can only hit them like with your shoulder or your hip.

141
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:06,930
Yeah.

142
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,490
The hip check.

143
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,009
Okay.

144
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,230
So yeah, it's very cool.

145
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,769
All right.

146
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,930
Our next word, goalie.

147
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:13,889
Goalie.

148
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:14,829
Goalie.

149
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:15,589
Goalie.

150
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,490
A goalie is a person.

151
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:17,889
Right.

152
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:22,389
And probably the bravest of the hockey match.

153
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:22,850
No kidding.

154
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,610
So why don't you tell us what the goalie does?

155
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:30,490
The goalie prevents the puck from coming in the net.

156
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,350
From going into the goal, right?

157
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:32,470
Yeah.

158
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,810
So the goalie stops the other team from getting a goal.

159
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:36,610
A goal.

160
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:36,930
Yep.

161
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,430
Okay, so the goalie prevents the goals.

162
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,050
All right.

163
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:40,670
Very interesting.

164
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,550
Now our fourth word is related to goalie.

165
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:43,949
Yes.

166
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:44,629
Save.

167
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:45,310
Save.

168
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,569
Save.

169
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,689
A save.

170
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,649
A save.

171
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:48,949
Yeah.

172
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,209
It's a noun here.

173
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:51,170
It's a noun here.

174
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,610
So the goalie makes saves.

175
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:54,269
That's right.

176
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:58,209
When he stops a goal, he makes a save.

177
00:05:58,569 --> 00:05:59,129
Makes a save.

178
00:05:59,149 --> 00:05:59,310
Yeah.

179
00:05:59,410 --> 00:05:59,550
Right.

180
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,009
Yeah.

181
00:06:00,009 --> 00:06:00,250
Okay.

182
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,430
We have some examples so we can understand this form of using save.

183
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:05,829
Yes.

184
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,449
Example one.

185
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,810
That was an unbelievable save.

186
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,310
Example two.

187
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,509
The goalie didn't make the save.

188
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:25,269
Example three.

189
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,250
What a save!

190
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:29,949
The Russians win!

191
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:37,250
Yeah, a little bit unusual here that save is a noun instead of a verb.

192
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,810
But I think those examples were helpful.

193
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,790
Now let's take a look at our last word.

194
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,029
Breakaway.

195
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,110
Breakaway.

196
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:46,129
Breakaway.

197
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,149
A breakaway.

198
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,189
Okay, so you have two words there that we know already.

199
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:50,689
Break.

200
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:51,129
Yes.

201
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,949
Right.

202
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:52,509
And away.

203
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,870
Yep.

204
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,290
So what do these two words together actually mean?

205
00:06:55,689 --> 00:07:00,649
Well imagine a group of hockey players all fighting to get the puck, right?

206
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,370
And then one player breaks off.

207
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,290
Breaks out of the group.

208
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:07,149
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,769
And he skates down the ice and he has the puck.

210
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,949
And he's far away from the other players.

211
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:13,670
Right, right.

212
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,550
So he's going away from the other players by himself.

213
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,870
Yep.

214
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,509
Okay, so breakaway.

215
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:22,649
Alright, so we've looked at a lot of hockey language here.

216
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:22,850
Yep.

217
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,269
And I think it's time now to listen to our dialogue again.

218
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:28,610
This time we're going to slow it down a little bit.

219
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,269
Yeah, I think this will help you to understand these words a little bit better.

220
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,449
Hello everyone.

221
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,949
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

222
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,970
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

223
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:54,670
You know Rick, today is a key game between Russia and Canada.

224
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,310
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

225
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,569
That's right.

226
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,930
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

227
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,990
The ref is calling the players for the face-off.

228
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,769
And here we go.

229
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,730
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

230
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,089
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

231
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,110
Mohi Rishad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

232
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,189
He shoots.

233
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,970
Wow, what a save by the goalie.

234
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,709
Alright, the puck is back in play now.

235
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,209
Pavel Bure is on a breakaway.

236
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,309
He is flying down the ice.

237
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,549
The defenders can't keep up.

238
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,649
Slapshot, he scores.

239
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,990
What an amazing goal.

240
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:53,990
Okay, this dialogue is interesting because we have commentators narrating or describing what's happening in that moment, right?

241
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:56,690
Yeah, and they're using some interesting grammar, aren't they?

242
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:03,470
Exactly, they are because some actions are happening in that moment, but we notice something a little bit strange.

243
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:06,090
Alright, well let's look at it in Grammar Breakdown.

244
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,669
Grammar Breakdown.

245
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,389
Okay, let's listen to this sentence that we previously heard in the dialogue.

246
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,190
Mohi Rishad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

247
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,350
He shoots.

248
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,590
Mohi Rishad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

249
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:26,750
He shoots.

250
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,789
I notice that he's using the present simple, right?

251
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:31,629
Yeah.

252
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,009
Even though the action is now, it's in present simple.

253
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:43,129
Yes, even though the action is happening in that moment, he's not using the present progressive, the present continuous.

254
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:48,070
This is because, if you notice, the actions are very, very brief.

255
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,029
And fast.

256
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:49,610
And fast.

257
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,250
And exciting.

258
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,870
Exactly.

259
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,049
So you don't really have enough time to say, for example, he is shooting.

260
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:57,250
Yes.

261
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,730
Because it's only one quick action.

262
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,990
He shoots the puck very fast, right?

263
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,870
Or, for example, you wouldn't really say he is passing.

264
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:06,789
Yeah, he is passing the puck.

265
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,529
Right, it's just one quick action.

266
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,049
He takes it and passes it and the action is finished.

267
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:11,549
Yes.

268
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:15,110
I think we can see a few more examples of this.

269
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,250
Let's listen again.

270
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,190
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

271
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,470
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

272
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:39,169
Here, we can hear that he is using the present simple again because these are very short actions that finish quickly, right?

273
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:39,830
Exactly.

274
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:49,970
And it's actually very, very common when you're describing something you see that's happening now, that's really exciting.

275
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,269
It's common to use present simple.

276
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:52,950
Exactly.

277
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,230
If you pay attention, most sporting events are in the same way, right?

278
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,730
They would describe the actions that are happening in the present simple, not present progressive.

279
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,750
But Marco, you have an example of some present progressive here, right?

280
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:10,350
Yes, let's listen to this sentence.

281
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:13,289
He is flying down the ice.

282
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,389
He is flying down the ice.

283
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,129
Now, we heard the sentence, he is flying down the ice, right?

284
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:22,629
Now, this one is in progressive.

285
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,809
Yeah, why is that?

286
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,809
Well, first of all, when we say he's flying down the ice, it's not that he's literally flying.

287
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,169
No, he's not in an airplane.

288
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,289
He's just skating really fast, right?

289
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:37,009
So we kind of exaggerate and we say, oh, he's flying down the ice.

290
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,190
But he's actually skating.

291
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,549
So this is a progressive action.

292
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:42,549
He is doing it.

293
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:45,090
It's happening for more than one second.

294
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,990
Yeah, exactly.

295
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:52,289
So that's why we would say he is flying down the ice instead of he flies down the ice, right?

296
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:54,909
Unless it was like really, really, fast.

297
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:55,389
Yeah.

298
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:56,269
Okay.

299
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:56,970
Okay.

300
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:04,669
So here we see that sometimes in English, we do use present simple to talk about what's happening now, right?

301
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:10,850
When it happens really, really quickly or when we want to show that it's really exciting.

302
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,549
Exactly.

303
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:11,990
Yep.

304
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,190
Makes it much more exciting if we just use the present simple.

305
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:15,610
Yeah.

306
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:31,509
Okay, let's listen to this exciting dialogue one more time and we'll come back.

307
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:38,149
Hello everyone.

308
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,230
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

309
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,210
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

310
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,269
You know, Rick, today's a key game between Russia and Canada.

311
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,970
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

312
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:50,110
That's right.

313
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,629
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

314
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,049
The ref is calling the players for the face off.

315
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,509
And here we go.

316
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,590
The Russians win possession and immediately start up their attack.

317
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,529
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

318
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,830
Boris Ryszow has the puck now and he passes it to center.

319
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:06,309
He shoots.

320
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,070
Wow.

321
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,350
What a save by the goalie.

322
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:09,830
All right.

323
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,450
The puck is back in play now.

324
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,090
Pavel Bory is on a breakaway.

325
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,889
He is flying down the ice.

326
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,750
The defenders can't keep up.

327
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,629
Slap shot.

328
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,490
He scores.

329
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,590
What an amazing goal.

330
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,389
All right, so hockey is the Canadian national sport.

331
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:32,710
Well, actually it isn't the national sport.

332
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:33,029
Yeah.

333
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:33,730
What is it?

334
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,509
Lacrosse.

335
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,110
Lacrosse?

336
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:35,450
Yeah.

337
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:38,649
But anyway, we don't have a lesson about lacrosse today.

338
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,230
Not yet.

339
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:39,610
No.

340
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:43,090
But actually all Canadians love hockey.

341
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,370
Like we start playing hockey when we're about two years old.

342
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:47,649
Yeah.

343
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,289
I've heard that.

344
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,610
Yeah.

345
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,669
I've heard that some Canadian children learn how to skate before they learn how to walk.

346
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,029
It's totally common.

347
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:56,889
Well, it is a great sport.

348
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,230
Very, very exciting.

349
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,169
It's very fast paced and it's very aggressive.

350
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,330
That's what I like about it.

351
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:02,830
I know.

352
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,889
Not violent, but very aggressive.

353
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:05,230
Yeah.

354
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:06,009
But you know what?

355
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,009
I must tell you that I am not a good Canadian.

356
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,370
You're not a hockey fan?

357
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,250
No, I'm not.

358
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:12,450
Really?

359
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:12,750
Yeah.

360
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,529
I really hate hockey.

361
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:15,009
Why?

362
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:16,870
You know what?

363
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,129
The puck is so small.

364
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:24,690
It's hard to see where it is on the ice and it's cold and these guys are fighting and anyway.

365
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:26,009
Have you ever been to a hockey game?

366
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:26,429
