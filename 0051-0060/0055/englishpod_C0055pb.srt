1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're going to be bringing you another great sports lesson.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, this one is for all our hockey fans.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I know we have a lot of listeners from Russia, so this is a very popular sport in Russia, Czech Republic.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, and Canada.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And Canada, right?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Very, very popular in Canada.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's our national game.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, I guess because you guys have so much ice.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I know, there's nothing else to do.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Skiing and hockey.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
All right, so it's going to be a really fun lesson.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We're going to have a lot of great vocabularies.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So before we start in the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, we have three words for you now.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The first one, really simple, puck.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Puck.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Puck.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Puck.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
P-U-C-K.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Puck.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So it's almost like duck, but with a P.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And this is actually kind of like the ball that you use in hockey.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But it's not a ball.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But it's not a ball.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's flat.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's flat.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And round.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And round.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So it looks like a disc.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Kind of like a mini frisbee.

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And this is what the players do.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is what they...

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They chase this around.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They chase it, right?

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So in basketball you have a ball, in soccer you have a ball, in hockey you have a puck.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, our next word.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Key game.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A key game.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
A key game.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So this word key.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Important.

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It means important, right?

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Really important.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So I can say a key game is a really important game.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Exactly.

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You could also maybe say a key player.

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A key player is a really important player.

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Or even a key goal.

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A key goal.

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay.

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So let's take a look at our last word now.

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Finals.

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Finals.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Finals.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The finals.

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So the finals are the last games.

63
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And the winner of the finals wins the championship.

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay.

66
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For example, in the World Cup in soccer, there's only one game played in the finals.

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So after everyone gets eliminated, there's one game where the winner is the champion.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

69
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So now we're ready to listen to our dialogue.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And it's gonna be a little bit faster than usual.

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Because it's a sports commentator, right?

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's exciting.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And it's exciting and there's a lot of action.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So don't worry about it.

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Listen to it, and then we'll come back and talk about some of the vocabulary.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello everyone.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You know, Rick, today's a key game between Russia and Canada.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The ref is calling the players for the faceoff.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And here we go.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Russians win possession and immediately start up their attack.

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Boris Ryszow has the puck now.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And he passes it to Sender.

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He shoots.

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Wow, what a save by the goalie.

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Alright, the puck is back in play now.

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Pavel Bory is on a breakaway.

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He is flying down the ice.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The defenders can't keep up.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Slap shot.

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He scores.

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What an amazing goal.

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Alright, so the Canadians versus the Russians, huh?

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It reminds me of a classic, classic game.

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Exactly.

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The classic match.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yep.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So let's take a look at some of the vocabulary that we heard in the dialogue in Language Takeaway.

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We have five phrases in Language Takeaway today.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the first one is faceoff.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Faceoff.

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Faceoff.

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Faceoff.

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So Marco, a faceoff here is a noun, right?

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a noun.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Exactly.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it's, so in the beginning of a match, the two players will stand face to face.

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right?

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's why it's called kind of a faceoff.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And the referee will drop the puck.

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And they'll try to get it.

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Exactly.

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So that's the faceoff.

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's the faceoff.

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yep.

124
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, let's take a look at our next word.

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Check.

126
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Check.

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To check.

128
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
To check.

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So an interesting verb here, hey?

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, it's really interesting because it's different from the way that you would say check or revise, right?

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yep.

133
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is actually kind of a violent move.

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

135
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So what do you do?

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So basically in hockey, you take your body and you hit another person with it.

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, so to check someone is to hit them with your body.

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
With your body, right.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can't use your arms or your legs or your hands.

140
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can only hit them like with your shoulder or your hip.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The hip check.

143
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

144
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So yeah, it's very cool.

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right.

146
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Our next word, goalie.

147
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Goalie.

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Goalie.

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Goalie.

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
A goalie is a person.

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Right.

152
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And probably the bravest of the hockey match.

153
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No kidding.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So why don't you tell us what the goalie does?

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The goalie prevents the puck from coming in the net.

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
From going into the goal, right?

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah.

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So the goalie stops the other team from getting a goal.

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A goal.

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yep.

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, so the goalie prevents the goals.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right.

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Very interesting.

164
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now our fourth word is related to goalie.

165
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Save.

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Save.

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Save.

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A save.

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A save.

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

172
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a noun here.

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's a noun here.

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So the goalie makes saves.

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's right.

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When he stops a goal, he makes a save.

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Makes a save.

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah.

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right.

180
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah.

181
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We have some examples so we can understand this form of using save.

183
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

184
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Example one.

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That was an unbelievable save.

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Example two.

187
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The goalie didn't make the save.

188
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Example three.

189
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What a save!

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The Russians win!

191
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, a little bit unusual here that save is a noun instead of a verb.

192
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But I think those examples were helpful.

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now let's take a look at our last word.

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Breakaway.

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Breakaway.

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Breakaway.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A breakaway.

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay, so you have two words there that we know already.

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Break.

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And away.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yep.

204
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So what do these two words together actually mean?

205
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well imagine a group of hockey players all fighting to get the puck, right?

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then one player breaks off.

207
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Breaks out of the group.

208
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

209
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And he skates down the ice and he has the puck.

210
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And he's far away from the other players.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Right, right.

212
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So he's going away from the other players by himself.

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yep.

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay, so breakaway.

215
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Alright, so we've looked at a lot of hockey language here.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yep.

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And I think it's time now to listen to our dialogue again.

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This time we're going to slow it down a little bit.

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, I think this will help you to understand these words a little bit better.

220
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hello everyone.

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

222
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

223
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You know Rick, today is a key game between Russia and Canada.

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

226
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

227
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The ref is calling the players for the face-off.

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And here we go.

229
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mohi Rishad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He shoots.

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wow, what a save by the goalie.

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Alright, the puck is back in play now.

235
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Pavel Bure is on a breakaway.

236
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He is flying down the ice.

237
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The defenders can't keep up.

238
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Slapshot, he scores.

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What an amazing goal.

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, this dialogue is interesting because we have commentators narrating or describing what's happening in that moment, right?

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, and they're using some interesting grammar, aren't they?

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Exactly, they are because some actions are happening in that moment, but we notice something a little bit strange.

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Alright, well let's look at it in Grammar Breakdown.

244
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Grammar Breakdown.

245
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, let's listen to this sentence that we previously heard in the dialogue.

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Mohi Rishad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He shoots.

248
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mohi Rishad has the puck now and passes it to the center.

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He shoots.

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I notice that he's using the present simple, right?

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Even though the action is now, it's in present simple.

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, even though the action is happening in that moment, he's not using the present progressive, the present continuous.

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is because, if you notice, the actions are very, very brief.

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And fast.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And fast.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And exciting.

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Exactly.

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So you don't really have enough time to say, for example, he is shooting.

260
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because it's only one quick action.

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He shoots the puck very fast, right?

263
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Or, for example, you wouldn't really say he is passing.

264
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, he is passing the puck.

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Right, it's just one quick action.

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He takes it and passes it and the action is finished.

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I think we can see a few more examples of this.

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's listen again.

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

271
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The Russians win possession and immediately set up their attack.

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Here, we can hear that he is using the present simple again because these are very short actions that finish quickly, right?

273
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Exactly.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And it's actually very, very common when you're describing something you see that's happening now, that's really exciting.

275
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's common to use present simple.

276
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Exactly.

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you pay attention, most sporting events are in the same way, right?

278
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They would describe the actions that are happening in the present simple, not present progressive.

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But Marco, you have an example of some present progressive here, right?

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes, let's listen to this sentence.

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He is flying down the ice.

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He is flying down the ice.

283
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Now, we heard the sentence, he is flying down the ice, right?

284
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Now, this one is in progressive.

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, why is that?

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, first of all, when we say he's flying down the ice, it's not that he's literally flying.

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
No, he's not in an airplane.

288
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's just skating really fast, right?

289
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So we kind of exaggerate and we say, oh, he's flying down the ice.

290
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But he's actually skating.

291
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So this is a progressive action.

292
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He is doing it.

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's happening for more than one second.

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah, exactly.

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So that's why we would say he is flying down the ice instead of he flies down the ice, right?

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Unless it was like really, really, fast.

297
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah.

298
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

299
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So here we see that sometimes in English, we do use present simple to talk about what's happening now, right?

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When it happens really, really quickly or when we want to show that it's really exciting.

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Exactly.

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Yep.

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Makes it much more exciting if we just use the present simple.

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah.

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay, let's listen to this exciting dialogue one more time and we'll come back.

307
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hello everyone.

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm Rick Fields and here with me is Bob Copeland.

309
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Howdy folks and welcome to today's game.

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You know, Rick, today's a key game between Russia and Canada.

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
As you know, the winner will move on to the finals.

312
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's right.

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And it looks like we're just about ready to start the match.

314
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The ref is calling the players for the face off.

315
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And here we go.

316
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The Russians win possession and immediately start up their attack.

317
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Fedorov gets checked hard into the boards.

318
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Boris Ryszow has the puck now and he passes it to center.

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He shoots.

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Wow.

321
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What a save by the goalie.

322
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
All right.

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The puck is back in play now.

324
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Pavel Bory is on a breakaway.

325
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He is flying down the ice.

326
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The defenders can't keep up.

327
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Slap shot.

328
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He scores.

329
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What an amazing goal.

330
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
All right, so hockey is the Canadian national sport.

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, actually it isn't the national sport.

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah.

333
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What is it?

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Lacrosse.

335
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Lacrosse?

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah.

337
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But anyway, we don't have a lesson about lacrosse today.

338
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Not yet.

339
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No.

340
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But actually all Canadians love hockey.

341
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Like we start playing hockey when we're about two years old.

342
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah.

343
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I've heard that.

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah.

345
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I've heard that some Canadian children learn how to skate before they learn how to walk.

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's totally common.

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, it is a great sport.

348
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Very, very exciting.

349
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's very fast paced and it's very aggressive.

350
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's what I like about it.

351
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I know.

352
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Not violent, but very aggressive.

353
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah.

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But you know what?

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I must tell you that I am not a good Canadian.

356
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're not a hockey fan?

357
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, I'm not.

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Really?

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yeah.

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I really hate hockey.

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why?

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You know what?

363
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The puck is so small.

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's hard to see where it is on the ice and it's cold and these guys are fighting and anyway.

365
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Have you ever been to a hockey game?

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,000
