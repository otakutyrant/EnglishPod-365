EnglishPod.com Oh honey, I'm glad you're okay, but I have some exciting news.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I think I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Really?

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Wow, that's amazing!

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is great news!

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've always wanted to be a father.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We have your test results back, and indeed, you are pregnant.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's see here, everything seems to be in order.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Your approximate due date is October 27th, 2009, so that means the baby was conceived on February 3rd, 2009.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Are you sure?

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are these things accurate?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, yes sir, they are.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's wrong?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you asking these questions?

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This baby isn't mine.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I...

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I...

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No, it can't be.
