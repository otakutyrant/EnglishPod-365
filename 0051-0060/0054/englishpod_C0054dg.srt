EnglishPod.com Oh honey, I'm glad you're okay, but I have some exciting news.

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,259
I think I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:40,500
Really?

4
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,740
Wow, that's amazing!

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,820
This is great news!

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,719
I've always wanted to be a father.

7
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,000
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

8
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,640
We have your test results back, and indeed, you are pregnant.

9
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,420
Let's see here, everything seems to be in order.

10
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,620
Your approximate due date is October 27th, 2009, so that means the baby was conceived on February 3rd, 2009.

11
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,859
Are you sure?

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,780
Are these things accurate?

13
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:25,659
Well, yes sir, they are.

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,920
What's wrong?

15
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:29,480
Why are you asking these questions?

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,560
This baby isn't mine.

17
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,099
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,239
I...

19
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,640
I...

20
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,299
No, it can't be.
