00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And we're going to be looking at our fifth episode of our famous love story.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I love you.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Part five.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So if you haven't listened to the first four, I suggest you go do that first because...

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're going to be a little bit lost.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But it's getting really good.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And so, so good that I don't think we can even say...

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's going to happen next.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We can't say what the key language is.

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh.

20
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We can't preview anything because we want to surprise you.

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But we can tell you this.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What's going on?

25
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The last time we saw Veronica and Steven, they broke up.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Right?

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Right.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And Veronica was with her friend and feeling really terrible.

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And then Steven suddenly came to sing a beautiful song.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So this is continuing on that.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Right.

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about some of the difficult vocabulary we might find.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But right after you decided you wanted a break, I was up north to put out some major forest fires.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was in the middle of nowhere working day and night trying to prevent the blaze from spreading.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It was pretty intense.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, honey.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm glad you're okay, but I have some exciting news.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I think I'm pregnant.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Really?

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Wow.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's amazing.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is great news.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've always wanted to be a father.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We have your test results back and indeed, you are pregnant.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's see here.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Everything seems to be in order.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your approximate due date is October 27th, 2009.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So that means the baby was conceived on February 3rd, 2009.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you sure?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Are these things accurate?

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, yes, sir.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They are.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What's wrong?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why are you asking these questions?

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This baby isn't mine.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I...

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I...

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It can't be.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So more drama in our love story.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, my God.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Things were going well and now more bad news.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Or good news.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Or good news.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're not sure yet.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yeah.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's take a look at the vocabulary first in Language Takeaway.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Language Takeaway.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, we're going to look at four words now.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The first one, blaze.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Blaze.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Blaze.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So this noun is another word for a fire, right?

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
For a big fire.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A really big fire.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The blaze.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So basically it's like the flame of the fire.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This one is a little bit difficult.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So I think we can use some examples to show us how to use this word.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Example one.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The blaze is spreading quickly.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We need to evacuate these people.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Example two.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We have to go in there and save those people from the blaze.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So it's clear now.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Blaze.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's look at our next word.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Conceived.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Conceived.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The past of conceive.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right.

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Conceive.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Conceive is a nice fancy word.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And what does it mean, Marco?

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
To create.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh.

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Like how you sidestepped around that one.

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So it means to create.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You can conceive a baby.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can conceive an idea.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yes.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So it basically means to create.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Most commonly with the baby.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah.

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Conceive.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So after the baby was conceived.

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yep.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We have a due date.

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We all know that it's nine months later.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

125
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yep.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Due dates.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So the due date is the date of birth, basically.

128
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's the doctor's guess when the birth would be.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Would be.

130
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

131
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When you go to the doctor and say, when will my baby be born?

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He'll say, well, your due date is blah, blah, blah.

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Nine months later.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yep.

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And our last word and language takeaway.

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Accurate.

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Accurate.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Accurate.

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Accurate.

141
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now, the due dates aren't accurate.

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That means they're not 100% sure or precise.

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So when something is accurate, it's absolutely certain.

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Absolutely precise.

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
100%.

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so accurate.

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's listen to some more examples of how we can use accurate.

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Example one.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A blood test is the most accurate way of finding out if you are pregnant.

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Example two.

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
These reports are not accurate, John.

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We checked and discovered a lot of mistakes.

155
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Example three.

156
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This new software helps us calculate costs in a very accurate way.

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
With those examples, I think we're ready to listen to this dialogue again.

158
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This time, we're going to slow it down, right?

159
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, in case you were so shocked by what happened that you couldn't follow.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Honey, of course I forgive you.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I love you so much.

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've really missed you.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please forgive me.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I was wrong to get upset over nothing.

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry I haven't called or anything.

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But right after you decided you wanted a break, I was called up north to put out some major forest fires.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was in the middle of nowhere, working day and night, trying to prevent the blaze from spreading.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was pretty intense.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, honey.

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm glad you're okay.

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I have some exciting news.

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think I'm pregnant.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Really?

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wow, that's amazing!

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is great news.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've always wanted to be a father.

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We have your test results back.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Look, and indeed, you are pregnant.

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's see here.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Everything seems to be in order.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Your approximate due date is October 27, 2009.

183
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So that means the baby was conceived on February 3, 2009.

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are you sure?

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are these things accurate?

186
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, yes sir, they are.

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's wrong?

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why are you asking these questions?

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This baby isn't mine.

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I, I, no, it can't be.

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All right, so continuing on with our drama, let's take a look at some interesting phrases in Fluency Builder.

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Fluency Builder.

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, we've got three phrases for you.

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The first one is the middle of nowhere.

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Middle of nowhere.

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Middle of nowhere.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Middle of nowhere.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is a kind of a funny one, but I think if we listen to some examples, it will help us to understand the meaning of this phrase.

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Example one.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We are in the middle of nowhere.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How can we find our way back home?

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Example two.

204
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I was in the middle of nowhere, so I couldn't even use my mobile phone.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Example three.

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It takes me two hours to drive to your house.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's in the middle of nowhere.

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
All right, so middle of nowhere, it means that you are lost.

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah, you're in a place with no cities or people or anything.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so just imagine yourself in a desert.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That would be the middle of nowhere.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, or in Canada.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Canada.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That would be the middle of nowhere.

215
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
All right, let's take a look at our next phrase.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
First thing in the morning.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
First thing in the morning.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
First thing in the morning.

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
First thing in the morning.

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So when we talk about the first thing, it means...

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Really, really early in the morning.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Really early.

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So I can change it a little bit and say first thing in the afternoon.

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Early in the afternoon.

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Or first thing tomorrow morning.

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right.

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right?

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So really early tomorrow.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, so it's a very common way of referring to very early.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, it's not like first thing in the morning is like six o'clock in the morning, right?

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But if you say, okay, I'll take care of that first thing in the morning, you'll do it right away in the morning.

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Right away.

233
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Right when you get to the office, for example.

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Right, yeah.

235
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, let's look at our last phrase.

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Seems to be in order.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Seems to be in order.

238
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Everything seems to be in order.

239
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So everything is okay.

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Everything's normal.

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Everything seems to be normal.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yep.

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Everything looks okay.

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So this is a very common phrase when people check your documents or report.

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Uh-huh, yeah, that's true.

247
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They'll say, okay, all the papers seem to be in order.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mm-hmm.

249
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Very common.

250
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, good news when you're pregnant that everything seems to be in order.

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Exactly.

252
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Everything is normal.

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All right, so let's listen to this dramatic dialogue one more time and we'll come back and talk some more.

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is up north to put out some major forest fires.

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was in the middle of nowhere working day and night trying to prevent the blaze from spreading.

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It was pretty intense.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, honey, I'm glad you're okay, but I have some exciting news.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think I'm pregnant.

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Really?

260
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wow, that's amazing.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is great news.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I've always wanted to be a father.

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We'll go to the doctor first thing in the morning.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
We have your test results back, and indeed, you are pregnant.

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's see here.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Everything seems to be in order.

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Your approximate due date is October 27th, 2009, so that means the baby was conceived on February 3rd, 2009.

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you sure?

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Are these things accurate?

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, yes, sir, they are.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's wrong?

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why are you asking these questions?

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This baby isn't mine.

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was away the first week of February at a training seminar.

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I...

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I...

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No, it can't be.

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Well, Marco, what do you think about this situation?

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What would you do if you were this guy?

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's complicated.

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I know.

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know what I would do.

283
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It seems like something very typical of soap operas.

284
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

285
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, I don't know because she didn't really deny it in the end.

286
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She didn't say no right away.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, but she didn't say like, oh.

288
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, she didn't really accept it, so it's still a little bit difficult to see if maybe she cheated on him or something.

289
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hey, guys, what do you think?

290
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you think Veronica cheated on Steven?

291
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do you think it's his baby?

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Maybe it's not.

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Maybe the doctor is wrong.

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Maybe it's the doctor's baby.

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Maybe it's...

296
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Anything could happen here at EnglishPod, so send us your ideas and tell us what do you think happens next.

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Exactly, and we want to know what you think will happen next.

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

301
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
All right, guys, so until next time.

302
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Bye.
