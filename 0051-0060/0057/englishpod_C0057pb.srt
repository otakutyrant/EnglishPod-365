00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello, English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,459
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,400
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're back in the office.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,179
We have a lesson that's talking about something that goes wrong in the office.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,079
Yes, something that I can really understand well, but we'll talk about that later.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,980
So this lesson is about a photocopier.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,179
A photocopier.

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,480
So let's take a look at this word in vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,940
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,440
All right, so a photocopier makes copies.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,759
Yeah, it makes copies of documents.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,179
We often call it a copier or a copy machine.

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,460
Yeah, so you can call it a photocopier, copy machine, or copier.

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,859
Yes, or a Xerox machine as well.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,859
Xerox machine.

17
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,859
Yeah, we can talk about that a little bit later, because that's an interesting story.

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,200
OK.

19
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:51,600
All right, let's take a look at our next word.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,579
Toner.

21
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:53,659
Toner.

22
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,460
Toner.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,140
Toner.

24
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,060
So toner is what the copy machine uses to make copies.

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
It's like the ink.

26
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,219
It's a very fine black powder.

27
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:06,659
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,459
So it's not an ink.

29
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,159
No, it's actually dry.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:09,640
OK.

31
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,159
Yeah, yeah, it's dry.

32
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,680
It's a powder, so you don't want to get that all over you.

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:14,379
All right.

34
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,519
Well, good advice, Marco.

35
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,939
And our last word in vocabulary preview, malfunction.

36
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,260
Malfunction.

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,239
Malfunction.

38
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:23,180
Malfunction.

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,500
Let's break down this word.

40
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:24,980
All right.

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,680
To work.

42
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:28,799
All right.

43
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,239
I guess mal maybe comes from Latin or something, because in Spanish we say mal, which is something evil or not good.

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,599
OK, so I think we can understand malfunction is...

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,519
Not good working, right?

46
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:43,140
Yeah.

47
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,700
OK, more or less, it's not working properly.

48
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,219
Not working properly, right.

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,680
OK, well, why don't we listen to the dialogue and find out what isn't working properly.

50
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:04,739
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

51
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,719
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,979
Sure.

53
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,460
I think I broke this thing.

54
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,159
Maxine, can you help me out here?

55
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,580
I'm not really a tech guy.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,539
Yeah, sure.

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,259
I think it's just out of toner.

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,460
You can go use the other one upstairs.

59
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,680
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,439
Sure.

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,400
Damn it, everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

62
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,159
I'll send the stupid fax later.

63
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,300
Oh great, is someone playing a practical joke on me?

64
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,039
This is ridiculous.

65
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,919
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
Just take the stairs, dude.

67
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,979
What floor are you going to?

68
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,599
I have to go up fifteen floors.

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,020
Never mind.

70
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,620
Made it.

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
There's a copier.

72
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,500
No!

73
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,539
Okay, so this copy machine is definitely not working properly.

74
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:47,180
A serious malfunction.

75
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,659
A serious malfunction.

76
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,240
I think the whole building exploded.

77
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,520
Alright, very dramatic here at EnglishPod, but we have fun, right?

78
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:55,219
Exactly.

79
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:59,819
Okay, let's take a look at some of the great language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

80
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,979
Language Takeaway.

81
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,000
Alright, three words for you here in Language Takeaway.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,539
And we heard all of these in the dialogue.

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,120
So this guy needs to get a copy ASAP.

84
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,159
ASAP.

85
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,019
ASAP.

86
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,939
Or ASAP.

87
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:18,779
Yes.

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:19,899
Meaning?

89
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,819
As soon as possible.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So really, really fast.

91
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:24,759
Really fast.

92
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,040
Yep.

93
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,819
This is a very, very common phrase, right?

94
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,779
So it's an acronym, and you can say it like ASAP or ASAP.

95
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:33,639
Exactly.

96
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,259
Yeah, usually people say it like that because it's too long, I guess, to say as soon as possible.

97
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,399
So, hey, I need this document ASAP.

98
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:40,899
Yes.

99
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,000
Or ASAP.

100
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,839
Okay, let's look at our next word.

101
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:46,560
A practical joke.

102
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,220
Practical joke.

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,899
Practical joke.

104
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,000
Practical joke.

105
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:53,160
Okay, so a practical joke.

106
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,660
I'm sure we have all played a practical joke on some of our friends, right?

107
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,139
Yes.

108
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,519
Basically what you do is you do something funny on purpose to someone.

109
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:02,839
Yeah.

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
But something crazy.

111
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,000
Crazy, right?

112
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:18,540
For example, when I was in university, there was this guy in our building, and we took all of his bedroom furniture, so his bed, his desk, everything, and put it down on the football field.

113
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,120
Nice.

114
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,139
Yeah, that was a practical joke.

115
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:25,199
That is a very good and elaborate practical joke.

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,579
Okay, so practical joke, do something crazy or funny to your friends.

117
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,399
Okay.

118
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,959
And now let's look at our last word.

119
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:33,939
Never mind.

120
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,819
Never mind.

121
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:35,800
Never mind.

122
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:36,560
Never mind.

123
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,500
Okay, so if you say never mind, it means...

124
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,180
Don't worry about it.

125
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,060
Don't worry about it.

126
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,319
Forget it.

127
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,019
Forget it.

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,120
Never mind.

129
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:43,480
Yep.

130
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:49,959
Yeah, this is, you know, this is so common, and I think it would be helpful to understand how it's used.

131
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,540
So let's hear some examples.

132
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,220
Example one.

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,019
Someone stole my wallet.

134
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,220
Oh, wait.

135
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,040
Never mind.

136
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,120
Here it is.

137
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,339
Example two.

138
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,139
Can you get some milk on your way home?

139
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,759
Oh, never mind.

140
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,019
We still have some.

141
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:19,139
Example three.

142
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,019
The printer's broken?

143
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,199
Never mind.

144
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:26,319
I'll do this later.

145
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:40,540
Okay, great examples, and I think our language takeaway is clear, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time, and then we'll come back and talk about putting it together.

146
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,939
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

147
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:56,899
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

148
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,120
Sure.

149
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,860
Um, I think I broke this thing.

150
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,620
Maxine, can you help me out here?

151
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not really a tech guy.

152
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,259
Yeah, sure.

153
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,980
I think it's just out of toner.

154
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,160
You can go use the other one upstairs.

155
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,379
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

156
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,199
Sure.

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,199
Damn it.

158
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,620
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

159
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll send the stupid fax later.

160
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:21,220
Oh, great!

161
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,240
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

162
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:23,980
This is ridiculous!

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,680
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

164
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,160
Just take the stairs, dude.

165
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
What floor are you going to?

166
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,579
I have to go up fifteen floors!

167
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,000
Never mind.

168
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,800
Made it.

169
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,360
There's a copier.

170
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,939
No!

171
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,899
In this dialogue, there's some great language that can be used in many different patterns, or in many different ways.

172
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:55,139
So, in today's Putting It Together, we're going to show you how to use three of these patterns.

173
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,220
Okay, the first pattern that we can look at is out of toner.

174
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,339
Out of toner.

175
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:06,680
Right.

176
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,680
So, we already talked about toner.

177
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:08,980
Yep.

178
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,399
Let's talk about out of.

179
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,839
Okay, so when you are out of, you have none.

180
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:14,540
Right.

181
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,319
So, let's change a little bit.

182
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,500
So, I can say, I am out of milk.

183
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,160
Uh-huh.

184
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,220
I'm out of time.

185
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,180
Out of time.

186
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,420
Right.

187
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,139
If you're driving, I'm out of gas or gasoline.

188
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,860
So, out of plus noun.

189
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:29,779
Mm-hmm.

190
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,480
Perfect.

191
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,620
It means you don't have none.

192
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,639
Yeah, you don't have none.

193
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,460
EnglishPod.com.

194
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,240
EnglishPod.com.

195
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,039
You ain't got none.

196
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,120
Eubonics.com.

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,539
All right.

198
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,240
Out of time.

199
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,279
Let's take a look at our second one.

200
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,379
On your way up.

201
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,919
Yeah.

202
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,840
On your way up.

203
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,039
On your way.

204
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:46,399
Right.

205
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:46,799
Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,299
So, this is a great way when you are talking to someone and they're going somewhere.

207
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:51,659
Yes.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,139
Right.

209
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,240
So, on your way up.

210
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,919
Can you bring this to HR?

211
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,519
Okay.

212
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,559
On your way to the store.

213
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,679
Can you mail this letter?

214
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Or maybe on your way home.

215
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,200
Can you buy me some flowers?

216
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,799
Nice.

217
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:08,179
All right.

218
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,259
So, on your way, it means.

219
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,379
It means while you are going there.

220
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,019
Right.

221
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah.

222
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,820
Taking advantage of the fact that you are going somewhere.

223
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,080
Yes.

224
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:16,679
Okay.

225
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,980
Now, let's take a look at our last one.

226
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,539
And this is a really great phrase.

227
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,139
Mm-hmm.

228
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,960
Breakdown.

229
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,960
Breakdown.

230
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,480
In our dialogue, we heard breaking down.

231
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,039
Yes.

232
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:26,460
Right?

233
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,460
Everything in the office seems to be breaking down.

234
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:29,759
Right.

235
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,980
So, when something breaks down.

236
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,919
It stops working.

237
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,139
It stops working.

238
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:34,320
Yeah.

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,779
Exactly.

240
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,799
So, we can change it a little bit.

241
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,840
What happens if we say break up?

242
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:39,440
Ooh.

243
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,399
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

244
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,120
Right.

245
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,559
They end their relationship.

246
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:42,980
Okay.

247
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,340
Okay.

248
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,159
So, we can maybe think about it as their relationship stops working.

249
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:48,159
Oh, nice one.

250
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:48,500
Right?

251
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:48,820
Yeah.

252
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:49,159
Okay.

253
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,600
What about break in?

254
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,980
Enter a place using force.

255
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:54,600
Right.

256
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,139
You enter a house that's not yours.

257
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,480
Yeah.

258
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,440
So, if you break into a house, maybe you break the window and climb in.

259
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:01,980
Okay.

260
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,440
Mm-hmm.

261
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
What about break out?

262
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,299
The opposite.

263
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,100
So, for example, you might break out of jail.

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Break out of prison.

265
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,500
Yeah.

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,240
So, this is a great phrase.

267
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,000
You can change the last word from break down, break up, break in.

268
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,960
And it means different things.

269
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,620
So, use different prepositions for different meanings.

270
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,200
Perfect.

271
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:21,700
Mm-hmm.

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,379
Okay.

273
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:30,960
So, now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and then Erica and I will be back and talk a little bit more about malfunctioning office supplies.

274
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,480
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

275
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,460
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

276
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,720
Sure.

277
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:05,220
Um, I think I broke this thing.

278
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,899
Maxine, can you help me out here?

279
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:08,299
I'm not really a tech guy.

280
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,299
Yeah, sure.

281
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,019
I think it's just out of toner.

282
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,220
You can go use the other one upstairs.

283
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,440
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

284
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,240
Sure.

285
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:26,720
Damn it.

286
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,139
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

287
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,919
I'll send the stupid fax later.

288
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, great!

289
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,039
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

290
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,759
This is ridiculous!

291
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,679
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

292
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,279
Just take the stairs, dude.

293
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,720
What floor are you going to?

294
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,299
I have to go up fifteen floors!

295
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:50,700
Never mind.

296
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,460
Made it.

297
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,379
There's a copier.

298
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,980
No!

299
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,740
Alright, so Erica, everything that you touch that's electronic seems to malfunction, right?

300
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,240
This is absolutely true.

301
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,279
I don't know what it is, but you know what?

302
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,519
If I turn on a computer, it will suddenly get a virus.

303
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,000
And even if I'm very careful, it still breaks.

304
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,820
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

305
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,960
I can relate to that.

306
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,200
But you are much better at computers and technology than I am.

307
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,419
Well, I really, really like them.

308
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,840
And, well, I guess even I know a little bit about copy machines or copiers because my uncles are copy technicians.

309
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,399
Really?

310
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:06,720
They fix copiers that broke down, or they replace toner, and they do all that stuff.

311
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,120
So that's why I know a little bit about it.

312
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,700
But actually the original term is a Xerox machine.

313
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,919
Yes, why is that?

314
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:12,759
From the brand, right?

315
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:20,460
There's a brand called Xerox, and Xerox invented and patented this technology of making copies.

316
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,559
Alright, well the next time my photocopier explodes, I'll call you.

317
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,019
Call my uncles, right?

318
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,299
Okay.

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,659
Alright, and well let us know how things in your office break down, or if you have any stories of Erica that breaks everything she touches.

320
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,419
Yeah, it's true.

321
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:44,639
Alright, so come to our website, come to our comments section, and leave your opinions and we'll be there to also answer any doubts or questions you might have.

322
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:50,279
That's right, you can find us at EnglishPod.com, and Marco and I are always around.

323
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,960
Alright, so we'll see you guys there.

324
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,700
Yeah, we will.

325
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,039
Okay guys, thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.
