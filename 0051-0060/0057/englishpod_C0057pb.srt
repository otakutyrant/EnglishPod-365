00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're back in the office.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have a lesson that's talking about something that goes wrong in the office.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, something that I can really understand well, but we'll talk about that later.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this lesson is about a photocopier.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
A photocopier.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's take a look at this word in vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
All right, so a photocopier makes copies.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, it makes copies of documents.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We often call it a copier or a copy machine.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yeah, so you can call it a photocopier, copy machine, or copier.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, or a Xerox machine as well.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Xerox machine.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, we can talk about that a little bit later, because that's an interesting story.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
OK.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
All right, let's take a look at our next word.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Toner.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Toner.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Toner.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Toner.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So toner is what the copy machine uses to make copies.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's like the ink.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's a very fine black powder.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So it's not an ink.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, it's actually dry.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
OK.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, yeah, it's dry.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a powder, so you don't want to get that all over you.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
All right.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, good advice, Marco.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And our last word in vocabulary preview, malfunction.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Malfunction.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Malfunction.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Malfunction.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's break down this word.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
All right.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
To work.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I guess mal maybe comes from Latin or something, because in Spanish we say mal, which is something evil or not good.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
OK, so I think we can understand malfunction is...

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Not good working, right?

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OK, more or less, it's not working properly.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Not working properly, right.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
OK, well, why don't we listen to the dialogue and find out what isn't working properly.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sure.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think I broke this thing.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Maxine, can you help me out here?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not really a tech guy.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, sure.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think it's just out of toner.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can go use the other one upstairs.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sure.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Damn it, everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll send the stupid fax later.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh great, is someone playing a practical joke on me?

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This is ridiculous.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Just take the stairs, dude.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What floor are you going to?

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I have to go up fifteen floors.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Never mind.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Made it.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There's a copier.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No!

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, so this copy machine is definitely not working properly.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A serious malfunction.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A serious malfunction.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think the whole building exploded.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Alright, very dramatic here at EnglishPod, but we have fun, right?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Exactly.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, let's take a look at some of the great language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Language Takeaway.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Alright, three words for you here in Language Takeaway.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And we heard all of these in the dialogue.

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So this guy needs to get a copy ASAP.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
ASAP.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
ASAP.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Or ASAP.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Meaning?

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
As soon as possible.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So really, really fast.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Really fast.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yep.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is a very, very common phrase, right?

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So it's an acronym, and you can say it like ASAP or ASAP.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Exactly.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, usually people say it like that because it's too long, I guess, to say as soon as possible.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So, hey, I need this document ASAP.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Or ASAP.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A practical joke.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Practical joke.

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Practical joke.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Practical joke.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Okay, so a practical joke.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm sure we have all played a practical joke on some of our friends, right?

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Basically what you do is you do something funny on purpose to someone.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But something crazy.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Crazy, right?

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:18,000
For example, when I was in university, there was this guy in our building, and we took all of his bedroom furniture, so his bed, his desk, everything, and put it down on the football field.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Nice.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, that was a practical joke.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That is a very good and elaborate practical joke.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay, so practical joke, do something crazy or funny to your friends.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And now let's look at our last word.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Never mind.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Never mind.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Never mind.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Never mind.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, so if you say never mind, it means...

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't worry about it.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't worry about it.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Forget it.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Forget it.

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Never mind.

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yep.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, this is, you know, this is so common, and I think it would be helpful to understand how it's used.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So let's hear some examples.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Example one.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Someone stole my wallet.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, wait.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Never mind.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Here it is.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Example two.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Can you get some milk on your way home?

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, never mind.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We still have some.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Example three.

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The printer's broken?

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Never mind.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll do this later.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, great examples, and I think our language takeaway is clear, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time, and then we'll come back and talk about putting it together.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sure.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Um, I think I broke this thing.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Maxine, can you help me out here?

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm not really a tech guy.

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, sure.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think it's just out of toner.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can go use the other one upstairs.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sure.

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Damn it.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

159
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll send the stupid fax later.

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, great!

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is ridiculous!

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Just take the stairs, dude.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What floor are you going to?

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I have to go up fifteen floors!

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Never mind.

168
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Made it.

169
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's a copier.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No!

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
In this dialogue, there's some great language that can be used in many different patterns, or in many different ways.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So, in today's Putting It Together, we're going to show you how to use three of these patterns.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, the first pattern that we can look at is out of toner.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Out of toner.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Right.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So, we already talked about toner.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yep.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's talk about out of.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so when you are out of, you have none.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So, let's change a little bit.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, I can say, I am out of milk.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Uh-huh.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm out of time.

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Out of time.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Right.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you're driving, I'm out of gas or gasoline.

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So, out of plus noun.

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Mm-hmm.

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Perfect.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It means you don't have none.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yeah, you don't have none.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
EnglishPod.com.

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
EnglishPod.com.

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You ain't got none.

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Eubonics.com.

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Out of time.

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's take a look at our second one.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
On your way up.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yeah.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,000
On your way up.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
On your way.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Right.

205
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mm-hmm.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, this is a great way when you are talking to someone and they're going somewhere.

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, on your way up.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Can you bring this to HR?

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
On your way to the store.

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Can you mail this letter?

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or maybe on your way home.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Can you buy me some flowers?

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Nice.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All right.

218
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So, on your way, it means.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It means while you are going there.

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Right.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Taking advantage of the fact that you are going somewhere.

223
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Now, let's take a look at our last one.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And this is a really great phrase.

227
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mm-hmm.

228
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Breakdown.

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Breakdown.

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In our dialogue, we heard breaking down.

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Right?

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Everything in the office seems to be breaking down.

234
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right.

235
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So, when something breaks down.

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It stops working.

237
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It stops working.

238
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah.

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Exactly.

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So, we can change it a little bit.

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What happens if we say break up?

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ooh.

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

244
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right.

245
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
They end their relationship.

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, we can maybe think about it as their relationship stops working.

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, nice one.

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Right?

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah.

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What about break in?

254
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Enter a place using force.

255
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right.

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You enter a house that's not yours.

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah.

258
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So, if you break into a house, maybe you break the window and climb in.

259
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay.

260
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mm-hmm.

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What about break out?

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The opposite.

263
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So, for example, you might break out of jail.

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Break out of prison.

265
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So, this is a great phrase.

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You can change the last word from break down, break up, break in.

268
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And it means different things.

269
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So, use different prepositions for different meanings.

270
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Perfect.

271
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Mm-hmm.

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay.

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So, now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and then Erica and I will be back and talk a little bit more about malfunctioning office supplies.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hey, Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me, please?

275
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sure.

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Um, I think I broke this thing.

278
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Maxine, can you help me out here?

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm not really a tech guy.

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, sure.

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think it's just out of toner.

282
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can go use the other one upstairs.

283
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

284
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sure.

285
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Damn it.

286
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll send the stupid fax later.

288
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, great!

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is ridiculous!

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Just take the stairs, dude.

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What floor are you going to?

294
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I have to go up fifteen floors!

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Never mind.

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Made it.

297
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There's a copier.

298
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
No!

299
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Alright, so Erica, everything that you touch that's electronic seems to malfunction, right?

300
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is absolutely true.

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know what it is, but you know what?

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
If I turn on a computer, it will suddenly get a virus.

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And even if I'm very careful, it still breaks.

304
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, it happens sometimes.

305
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can relate to that.

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But you are much better at computers and technology than I am.

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, I really, really like them.

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And, well, I guess even I know a little bit about copy machines or copiers because my uncles are copy technicians.

309
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Really?

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
They fix copiers that broke down, or they replace toner, and they do all that stuff.

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So that's why I know a little bit about it.

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But actually the original term is a Xerox machine.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, why is that?

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
From the brand, right?

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There's a brand called Xerox, and Xerox invented and patented this technology of making copies.

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Alright, well the next time my photocopier explodes, I'll call you.

317
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Call my uncles, right?

318
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay.

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Alright, and well let us know how things in your office break down, or if you have any stories of Erica that breaks everything she touches.

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, it's true.

321
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Alright, so come to our website, come to our comments section, and leave your opinions and we'll be there to also answer any doubts or questions you might have.

322
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's right, you can find us at EnglishPod.com, and Marco and I are always around.

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Alright, so we'll see you guys there.

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, we will.

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Okay guys, thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.
