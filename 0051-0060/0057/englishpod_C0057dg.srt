00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Hey Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me please?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sure.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I think I broke this thing.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Maxine, can you help me out here?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm not really a tech guy.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, sure.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I think it's just out of toner.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can go use the other one upstairs.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Sure.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Damn it!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll send the stupid fax later.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh great!

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is ridiculous!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Just take the stairs dude.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What floor are you going to?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have to go up 15 floors!

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Never mind.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Made it.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's a copier.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No!

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thanks for watching!
