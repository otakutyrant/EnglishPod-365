00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:09,800
EnglishPod.com Hey Carl, can you make a copy of this contract for me please?

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,839
And when you have it ready, send it out ASAP to our sub-branch.

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,199
Sure.

4
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,579
I think I broke this thing.

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,240
Maxine, can you help me out here?

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,659
I'm not really a tech guy.

7
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:35,640
Yeah, sure.

8
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:37,340
I think it's just out of toner.

9
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,560
You can go use the other one upstairs.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,759
On your way up, can you fax this while I try and fix this thing?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,479
Sure.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,060
Damn it!

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,479
Everything in this office seems to be breaking down.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,039
I'll send the stupid fax later.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,340
Oh great!

16
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,379
Is someone playing a practical joke on me?

17
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,099
This is ridiculous!

18
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,040
The elevator has some sort of malfunction.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Just take the stairs dude.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,060
What floor are you going to?

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,680
I have to go up 15 floors!

22
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,140
Never mind.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,680
Made it.

24
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,799
There's a copier.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,840
No!

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,780
Thanks for watching!
