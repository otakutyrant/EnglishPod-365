Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson and this time we're going to be shopping.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Actually, a lot of our users asked for some lessons about shopping, right?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I think one of the most important things when you go shopping is to get a good price.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to be teaching you how to bargain.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So Marco, you just mentioned a really great word.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's look at it in Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Vocabulary Preview Alright, so we're going to preview the word bargain today.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Bargain.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Bargain.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Bargain.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now this is an interesting word because it's a verb and a noun.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's right.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So a bargain is a good price, right?

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, so a bargain is a good price.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This t-shirt was a bargain.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I only paid a dollar for it.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, so that is a bargain.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But to bargain as a verb.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
To try and get a good price.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So it's very similar to negotiate.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah, so I would say it costs a hundred dollars.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And then I would say maybe, no, I'll give you fifty.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Seventy-five.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And then I'll say sixty.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Et cetera, et cetera.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And that's to bargain, right?

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, so we're going to be bargaining.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time as we have a woman bargaining in a store, right?

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello, may I help you?

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How much is it?

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That one is a hundred and fifty dollars.

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A hundred and fifty dollars?

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What about this other one over here?

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's a hundred and forty.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Um, that's a bit out of my price range.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Can you give me a better deal?

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is an exclusive design by Damarco.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a bargain at that price.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, I don't know.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I think I'll shop around.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, okay.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
How about a hundred dollars?

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What if I take both dresses?

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A hundred and ninety for both.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Still a bit pricey.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thanks anyway.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, my final price.

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
One hundred dollars for both.

63
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Great!

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You've got a deal.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Alright, that was some good bargaining skills right there.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, and you know what?

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She used a lot of good language to get a cheaper price, didn't she?

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That was good.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, let's take a look at this language in Language Takeaway.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, the first word we have in Language Takeaway today.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Price range.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Price range.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Price range.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Price range.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Price range.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What does that mean exactly?

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So, price range is the minimum and the maximum that you're willing to spend for a thing that you want to buy.

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Exactly.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So, in the dialogue we heard, it's out of my price range.

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's more than I can spend.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
More than I can spend.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, let's look at our next word.

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Shop around.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Shop around.

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Shop around.

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Shop around.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So, she said, I think I'll shop around.

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Right.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, she wants to check in a few other stores to see if there's a better price.

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If I shop around, I'm going and trying to compare prices maybe.

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Exactly.

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is a really good shopping technique.

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, it is.

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

99
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay, and let's look at our last word.

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Pricey.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Pricey.

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pricey.

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pricey.

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So, something that's pricey is?

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Expensive.

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Expensive.

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yep.

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is a more sort of informal way of saying expensive.

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Exactly.

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So, instead of saying, wow, that car is really expensive.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's really pricey.

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's really pricey.

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah.

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, let's listen to our dialogue for the second time and it's going to be slowed down a bit.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So, you'll understand some of these great words a little bit better.

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hello, may I help you?

117
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How much is it?

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That one is $150.

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
$150?

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What about this other one over here?

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's $140.

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's a bit out of my price range.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can you give me a better deal?

125
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is an exclusive design by Damarco.

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a bargain at that price.

127
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, I don't know.

128
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think I'll shop around.

129
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, okay.

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How about $100?

131
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What if I take both dresses?

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
$190 for both.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know.

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's still a bit pricey.

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thanks anyway.

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, my final price.

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
$100 for both.

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's two for the price of one.

141
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's my last offer.

142
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Great.

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You've got a deal.

144
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So we've covered the language in this dialogue.

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now let's take a look at some of the phrases in putting it together.

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So Marco, in this dialogue there's a lot of really useful phrases to help you get a better price when you shop, right?

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Exactly.

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So the first one we have is, can you give me a better deal?

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can you give me a better deal?

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Can you give me a better deal?

151
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So if I'm shopping and something is too expensive, I would use this sentence with the shopkeeper.

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yeah, so you might say, hey, this is out of my price range.

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Could you give me a better deal?

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can you give me a better deal?

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, we have some examples of, can you give me a better deal?

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's listen.

157
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I really like this shirt, but it's too expensive.

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can you give me a better deal?

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Example two.

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Can you give me a better price on this car?

161
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I really don't have that much money.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So you can see here that you can say, can you give me a better deal?

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Or, can you give me a better price?

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Alright, let's take a look at the next phrase.

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So if the seller suggests a really high price, you can say, that's still more than I wanted to spend.

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So basically you're telling the shopkeeper, it's still too expensive.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's still too expensive.

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You still don't want to spend that much.

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Alright, let's take a look at our last phrase.

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's my last offer.

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's my last offer.

175
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's my last offer.

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now this could work both ways.

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It could be the shopkeeper that's telling you that.

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's my lowest price.

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or you could say, that's my last offer.

180
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's my highest price if you are buying it.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Right.

182
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Because sometimes when you're bargaining, the shopkeeper will say, alright, what's your best offer?

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How much will you pay?

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
$100.

185
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's my final offer.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Alright, so we've looked at a lot of great phrases and words.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And now you're ready to bargain and also listen to this dialogue for the third time.

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And then we'll come back and talk some more.

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hello, may I help you?

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How much is it?

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That one is $150.

193
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
$150?

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What about this other one over here?

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's $140.

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's a bit out of my price range.

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Can you give me a better deal?

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is an exclusive design by Damarco.

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a bargain at that price.

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, I don't know.

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think I'll shop around.

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, okay.

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How about $100?

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What if I take both dresses?

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

207
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
$190 for both.

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know.

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's still a bit pricey.

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thanks anyway.

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, my final price.

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
$100 for both.

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Great!

215
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You cause a deal.

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright, so I know that in Canada it's not really common to bargain, right?

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, it really isn't.

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Even when you go to the market to buy fruits and vegetables, it's very, very rare to bargain with a shopkeeper.

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How about in Ecuador?

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, in Ecuador you definitely bargain.

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, if you go to the mall, for example, or if you go to a supermarket, of course you wouldn't really bargain.

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Unless maybe you go to a small store or you go to one of the local markets, then it's more common to bargain.

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And you have to because people expect you to bargain.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Really?

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, in many countries in the world, bargaining is almost like an art.

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, that's true.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Actually, Marco, you are an excellent bargainer, aren't you?

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah, I've been known to bargain with the shopkeepers.

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I've been known to bargain a little bit with the shopkeepers and helping out.

230
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
A little bit?

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I mean, you've got better prices than I can even imagine getting.

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, that's a good story.

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Maybe we'll get JP to go to our comments section and tell you about that.

234
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So we want to know about your countries.

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is it common to bargain?

236
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do you really do it?

237
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is it okay?

238
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Or when is it okay?

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, tell us.
