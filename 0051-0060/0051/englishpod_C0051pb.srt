Hello English learners.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,720
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:04,559
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,639
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:09,779
And today we're bringing you another great lesson and this time we're going to be shopping.

6
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:10,539
That's right.

7
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:14,939
Actually, a lot of our users asked for some lessons about shopping, right?

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,759
Exactly.

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,839
And I think one of the most important things when you go shopping is to get a good price.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,539
That's right.

11
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,899
So we're going to be teaching you how to bargain.

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,660
So Marco, you just mentioned a really great word.

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,460
Let's look at it in Vocabulary Preview.

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,140
Vocabulary Preview Alright, so we're going to preview the word bargain today.

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,000
Bargain.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,719
Bargain.

17
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:37,340
Bargain.

18
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,420
Now this is an interesting word because it's a verb and a noun.

19
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:41,179
That's right.

20
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,920
So a bargain is a good price, right?

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,100
Okay, so a bargain is a good price.

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:48,539
Yeah.

23
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,619
This t-shirt was a bargain.

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,460
I only paid a dollar for it.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,859
Okay, so that is a bargain.

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,140
Yes.

27
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,579
But to bargain as a verb.

28
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,759
To try and get a good price.

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,439
So it's very similar to negotiate.

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,340
Yeah, so I would say it costs a hundred dollars.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,400
And then I would say maybe, no, I'll give you fifty.

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,599
Seventy-five.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,019
And then I'll say sixty.

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,959
Et cetera, et cetera.

35
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,120
And that's to bargain, right?

36
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,980
Okay, so we're going to be bargaining.

37
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,840
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time as we have a woman bargaining in a store, right?

38
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:20,400
That's right.

39
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,560
Hello, may I help you?

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,980
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

41
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,079
How much is it?

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,140
That one is a hundred and fifty dollars.

43
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:36,640
A hundred and fifty dollars?

44
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,459
What about this other one over here?

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,980
That's a hundred and forty.

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,260
Um, that's a bit out of my price range.

47
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,280
Can you give me a better deal?

48
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,620
This is an exclusive design by Damarco.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,799
It's a bargain at that price.

50
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,599
Well, I don't know.

51
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,099
I think I'll shop around.

52
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,239
Okay, okay.

53
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,439
How about a hundred dollars?

54
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,379
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

55
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,840
What if I take both dresses?

56
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,659
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

57
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,659
A hundred and ninety for both.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,759
I don't know.

59
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,740
Still a bit pricey.

60
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,020
Thanks anyway.

61
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,479
Okay, my final price.

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,819
One hundred dollars for both.

63
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,000
That's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,699
Great!

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,639
You've got a deal.

66
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,580
Alright, that was some good bargaining skills right there.

67
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Yeah, and you know what?

68
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:33,199
She used a lot of good language to get a cheaper price, didn't she?

69
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:33,840
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,340
That was good.

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,659
So, let's take a look at this language in Language Takeaway.

72
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:45,219
Okay, the first word we have in Language Takeaway today.

73
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:46,620
Price range.

74
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,240
Price range.

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,060
Price range.

76
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,139
Price range.

77
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,000
Price range.

78
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,060
What does that mean exactly?

79
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,000
So, price range is the minimum and the maximum that you're willing to spend for a thing that you want to buy.

80
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Exactly.

81
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,280
So, in the dialogue we heard, it's out of my price range.

82
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,819
It's more than I can spend.

83
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,780
More than I can spend.

84
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah.

85
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:06,740
Okay.

86
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,400
Okay, let's look at our next word.

87
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,500
Shop around.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,520
Shop around.

89
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,479
Shop around.

90
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,240
Shop around.

91
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,219
So, she said, I think I'll shop around.

92
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:15,800
Right.

93
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:20,439
So, she wants to check in a few other stores to see if there's a better price.

94
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,439
If I shop around, I'm going and trying to compare prices maybe.

95
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:24,939
Exactly.

96
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,560
This is a really good shopping technique.

97
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,460
Yeah, it is.

98
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:28,759
Yeah.

99
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,860
Okay, and let's look at our last word.

100
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,099
Pricey.

101
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:32,939
Pricey.

102
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,000
Pricey.

103
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,560
Pricey.

104
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,800
So, something that's pricey is?

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,379
Expensive.

106
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,039
Expensive.

107
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,280
Yep.

108
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,840
This is a more sort of informal way of saying expensive.

109
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:42,460
Exactly.

110
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,819
So, instead of saying, wow, that car is really expensive.

111
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,860
It's really pricey.

112
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:47,759
It's really pricey.

113
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,159
Yeah.

114
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,419
Okay, let's listen to our dialogue for the second time and it's going to be slowed down a bit.

115
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,979
So, you'll understand some of these great words a little bit better.

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Hello, may I help you?

117
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,159
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
How much is it?

119
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,960
That one is $150.

120
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:08,819
$150?

121
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,860
What about this other one over here?

122
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:13,900
That's $140.

123
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,939
That's a bit out of my price range.

124
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,040
Can you give me a better deal?

125
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,100
This is an exclusive design by Damarco.

126
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,240
It's a bargain at that price.

127
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,220
Well, I don't know.

128
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,100
I think I'll shop around.

129
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,439
Okay, okay.

130
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,800
How about $100?

131
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,860
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

132
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,860
What if I take both dresses?

133
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,720
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,079
$190 for both.

135
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,459
I don't know.

136
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,660
It's still a bit pricey.

137
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,240
Thanks anyway.

138
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,680
Okay, my final price.

139
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,800
$100 for both.

140
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,500
That's two for the price of one.

141
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,000
That's my last offer.

142
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:03,740
Great.

143
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,259
You've got a deal.

144
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,319
So we've covered the language in this dialogue.

145
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,399
Now let's take a look at some of the phrases in putting it together.

146
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,540
So Marco, in this dialogue there's a lot of really useful phrases to help you get a better price when you shop, right?

147
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:27,439
Exactly.

148
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,779
So the first one we have is, can you give me a better deal?

149
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,240
Can you give me a better deal?

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,480
Can you give me a better deal?

151
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:41,459
So if I'm shopping and something is too expensive, I would use this sentence with the shopkeeper.

152
00:05:42,019 --> 00:05:46,399
Yeah, so you might say, hey, this is out of my price range.

153
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Could you give me a better deal?

154
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:48,920
Can you give me a better deal?

155
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,180
Okay, we have some examples of, can you give me a better deal?

156
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:53,980
Let's listen.

157
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,839
I really like this shirt, but it's too expensive.

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,699
Can you give me a better deal?

159
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:07,220
Example two.

160
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,779
Can you give me a better price on this car?

161
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,519
I really don't have that much money.

162
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,860
So you can see here that you can say, can you give me a better deal?

163
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,040
Or, can you give me a better price?

164
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,120
Alright, let's take a look at the next phrase.

165
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:27,480
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

166
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,800
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

167
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,279
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

168
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:39,459
So if the seller suggests a really high price, you can say, that's still more than I wanted to spend.

169
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,180
So basically you're telling the shopkeeper, it's still too expensive.

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,920
It's still too expensive.

171
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,579
You still don't want to spend that much.

172
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,480
Alright, let's take a look at our last phrase.

173
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,139
That's my last offer.

174
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,040
That's my last offer.

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,139
That's my last offer.

176
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,639
Now this could work both ways.

177
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,600
It could be the shopkeeper that's telling you that.

178
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:57,959
That's my lowest price.

179
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,860
Or you could say, that's my last offer.

180
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,019
That's my highest price if you are buying it.

181
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:03,300
Right.

182
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:07,620
Because sometimes when you're bargaining, the shopkeeper will say, alright, what's your best offer?

183
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,660
How much will you pay?

184
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,439
$100.

185
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,199
That's my final offer.

186
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,240
Alright, so we've looked at a lot of great phrases and words.

187
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,720
And now you're ready to bargain and also listen to this dialogue for the third time.

188
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,500
And then we'll come back and talk some more.

189
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,540
Hello, may I help you?

190
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Yeah, this dress is really nice.

191
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,980
How much is it?

192
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,740
That one is $150.

193
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,980
$150?

194
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,459
What about this other one over here?

195
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,800
That's $140.

196
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,220
That's a bit out of my price range.

197
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,220
Can you give me a better deal?

198
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,560
This is an exclusive design by Damarco.

199
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,779
It's a bargain at that price.

200
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,540
Well, I don't know.

201
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
I think I'll shop around.

202
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay, okay.

203
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,100
How about $100?

204
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,339
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

205
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,779
What if I take both dresses?

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,620
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

207
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:06,660
$190 for both.

208
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,699
I don't know.

209
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,680
It's still a bit pricey.

210
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:11,980
Thanks anyway.

211
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,399
Okay, my final price.

212
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,759
$100 for both.

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,920
That's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

214
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:17,639
Great!

215
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:18,620
You cause a deal.

216
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,019
Alright, so I know that in Canada it's not really common to bargain, right?

217
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,420
No, it really isn't.

218
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,700
Even when you go to the market to buy fruits and vegetables, it's very, very rare to bargain with a shopkeeper.

219
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,080
How about in Ecuador?

220
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,240
No, in Ecuador you definitely bargain.

221
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,659
Well, if you go to the mall, for example, or if you go to a supermarket, of course you wouldn't really bargain.

222
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:49,039
Unless maybe you go to a small store or you go to one of the local markets, then it's more common to bargain.

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,019
And you have to because people expect you to bargain.

224
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:52,399
Really?

225
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,120
Yeah, in many countries in the world, bargaining is almost like an art.

226
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:56,840
Yeah, that's true.

227
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,139
Actually, Marco, you are an excellent bargainer, aren't you?

228
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,299
Yeah, I've been known to bargain with the shopkeepers.

229
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,940
I've been known to bargain a little bit with the shopkeepers and helping out.

230
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,659
A little bit?

231
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:13,059
I mean, you've got better prices than I can even imagine getting.

232
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:15,179
Yeah, that's a good story.

233
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,639
Maybe we'll get JP to go to our comments section and tell you about that.

234
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:21,879
So we want to know about your countries.

235
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Is it common to bargain?

236
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,899
Do you really do it?

237
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,580
Is it okay?

238
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,159
Or when is it okay?

239
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,159
