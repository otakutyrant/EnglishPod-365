00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,000
EnglishPod.com Well, I don't know.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think I'll shop around.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay, okay.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How about $100?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's still more than I wanted to spend.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What if I take both dresses?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, I can give you a special discount just because you seem like a nice person.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
$190 for both.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still a bit pricey.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thanks anyway.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, my final price.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
$100 for both.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's two for the price of one and that's my last offer.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Great!

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
