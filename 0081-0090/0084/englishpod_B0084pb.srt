1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,480
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,019
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,740
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,780
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
And where are we going today, Erika?

6
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:09,460
To the pharmacy.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,259
Alright, to the pharmacy or drugstore?

8
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:12,939
Yes.

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,719
Or also in British English, sometimes people say the chemist.

10
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,519
That's right.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,899
So as you know, at the pharmacy, you get medicine, but there are certain vocabulary words that are related to this place that we need to learn.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:25,399
That's right.

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,559
So we're going to learn some vocabulary about medicine and also some interesting phrases.

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,439
So before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,759
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,719
We're going to look at two words today that you'll hear in the dialogue.

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,500
And the first one, milligrams.

18
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:44,939
Milligrams.

19
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:45,859
Milligrams.

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,159
Also, the abbreviation for this is MG.

21
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:49,939
That's right.

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,460
Okay.

23
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,960
So a milligram is?

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,560
A hundredth of a gram.

25
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,820
So there are 100 milligrams in a gram.

26
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:57,479
Exactly.

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,219
And it's very common to be used with medicine, right?

28
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:00,700
Exactly.

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,340
You buy medicine in milligrams.

30
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,280
Okay.

31
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:04,340
And what's our next word?

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,560
Price check.

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,099
A price check.

34
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,040
A price check.

35
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:08,640
Okay.

36
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,799
So at the pharmacy or at the supermarket, sometimes the cashier will ask for a price check.

37
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,319
And that is the action of checking to find out the price.

38
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

39
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,700
So a price check.

40
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:30,000
With this, I think we're ready now to listen to our dialogue for the first time and let's see what our shopper is buying at the pharmacy.

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,900
Hello, sir.

42
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,000
How can I help you?

43
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:41,780
Yes.

44
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,060
I need this prescription, please.

45
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,200
Let's see.

46
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:45,859
Okay.

47
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,219
So 50 milligrams of Prozac.

48
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,760
Capsules are fine.

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:52,859
Okay.

51
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,560
You should take one capsule three times a day.

52
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,659
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

53
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, I know.

54
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,659
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,480
Don't worry.

56
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,260
I won't overdose.

57
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,260
Okay.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,520
Anything else I can get you?

59
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,159
Oh, yes.

60
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:11,080
I almost forgot.

61
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,500
Can I also get some eye drops and some condoms?

62
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,560
Sure.

63
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,520
Darn.

64
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,460
Condoms aren't registered in our system.

65
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh, well, that's okay.

66
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,639
I'll get some later.

67
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,020
Thanks.

68
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,599
Really?

69
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,259
It's no problem.

70
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,300
Just hang on there a sec.

71
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,000
Can I get a price check on fun times?

72
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,379
Ribbed condoms, please.

73
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:38,219
Oh, no.

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
How embarrassing.

75
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:45,479
A little bit embarrassing that she asked for a price check on these condoms, right?

76
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,080
Yeah.

77
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:46,639
But you know what?

78
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:52,379
It seems like every time you have to buy something embarrassing at the pharmacy, there's a million people watching you.

79
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:52,699
Yeah.

80
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,099
It never fails.

81
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:54,500
Yeah.

82
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,199
Well, let's take a look at some of those words that we were talking about related to medicine in language takeaway.

83
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,400
Language takeaway.

84
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,319
All right.

85
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,919
Well, the first word, a prescription.

86
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,360
Prescription.

87
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:09,960
Prescription.

88
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:10,979
All right.

89
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,479
So what is a prescription?

90
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:17,639
Well, a prescription is a note from your doctor explaining what medicine you need.

91
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,240
So this note from your doctor is necessary to buy that medicine, right?

92
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:22,659
Exactly.

93
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,280
Okay.

94
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:23,960
Prescription.

95
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:32,099
Well, this shopper was getting some medicine and, well, the chemist or the pharmacist asked if he wanted it in capsules or tablets.

96
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,759
So let's look at those two words.

97
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,900
A capsule.

98
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,060
Capsule.

99
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,699
Capsule.

100
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,300
Now, a capsule is like a small tube, right?

101
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,599
Yeah.

102
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,060
It's a form of a pill and it's shaped like a tube with the medicine inside.

103
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:46,439
Inside.

104
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,939
And it's covered in plastic, right?

105
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Exactly.

106
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,400
Now you swallowed the capsule.

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,219
And the tablet is like a pill that is round and flat.

108
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:55,759
Okay.

109
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:57,819
So tablet and capsule.

110
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,800
Both are the same thing, basically, but just different presentations, different shapes, different shapes.

111
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:04,139
Yeah.

112
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:07,139
It's easier maybe for some people to swallow a capsule.

113
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,879
You think so?

114
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:08,580
I don't know.

115
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,240
I think so.

116
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, because sometimes tablets are a little bit like big circles and it's hard to swallow.

117
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:14,620
Yeah.

118
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,779
And I guess capsules are smoother.

119
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:18,879
Yeah, exactly.

120
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,660
But we're not pharmacists, so let's move on and focus on the language, which is what we do know about.

121
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,420
So the pharmacist warned the patient not to take too much medicine, right?

122
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:31,959
Because he might overdose.

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,079
Overdose.

124
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:33,939
Overdose.

125
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:34,740
Okay.

126
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,240
So to overdose, like you said, is to take too much medicine and get really sick or even die.

127
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,339
So if you overdose on medicine, it could be bad for you instead of good.

128
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,939
Well, obviously very bad.

129
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,540
And what about our last word for today?

130
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,839
Well, the shopper also asked for some eye drops.

131
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:55,920
Eye drops.

132
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,579
Eye drops.

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,300
So this is medicine for your eyes.

134
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,199
Yeah, usually liquid, like water that you put in your eyes.

135
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:02,660
Okay.

136
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:09,360
So I think now with this medicine language clear, we can listen to our dialogue again, but it's going to be slowed down a little bit.

137
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,300
That'll help us understand these phrases just a little bit better.

138
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,579
Hello, sir.

139
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,300
How can I help you?

140
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,600
Yes, I need this prescription, please.

141
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,879
Let's see.

142
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,920
Okay.

143
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,240
So 50 milligrams of Prozac.

144
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,500
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

145
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,300
Capsules are fine.

146
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:39,500
Okay.

147
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:43,180
You should take one capsule three times a day.

148
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,600
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach.

149
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,339
And also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

150
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,279
Yes, I know.

151
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,620
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

152
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:55,819
Don't worry.

153
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,160
I won't overdose.

154
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,240
Okay.

155
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,600
Anything else I can get you?

156
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:01,860
Oh, yes.

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,959
I almost forgot.

158
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,300
Can I get some eye drops and some condoms?

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,420
Sure.

160
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,339
Darn condoms aren't registered in our system.

161
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Oh, well, that's okay.

162
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,279
I'll get some later.

163
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Thanks.

164
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Really, it's no problem.

165
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,139
Just hang on there a sec.

166
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,959
Can I get a price check on Fun Times ribbed condoms, please?

167
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:40,399
Okay, so now it's time for us to take a look at some of the phrases that we saw in this dialogue in Putting It Together.

168
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,800
Putting it together.

169
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,800
We're going to look at two phrases here, and we're going to see how we can use them in different situations.

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,079
The pharmacist warned, be sure not to take it on an empty stomach.

171
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,939
Okay, so be sure not to be sure not to.

172
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,980
So what does he mean by this?

173
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
He just means don't do this.

174
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,660
Okay, so don't don't take the medicine without eating.

175
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,579
We can mix it up a little bit.

176
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,860
Why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this in different situations.

177
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,319
Example one.

178
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,699
Be sure not to leave your bike outside or it will be stolen.

179
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,079
Example two.

180
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,500
Be sure not to forget your umbrella.

181
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:29,699
It's raining today.

182
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,759
Example three.

183
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,480
I told him to be sure not to do anything stupid, but he did.

184
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,439
So Marco, why should we say be sure not to instead of don't?

185
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,459
I think don't sounds more like an order.

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,779
Very direct.

187
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,040
Maybe be sure not to is a little bit softer, a little bit more friendly.

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,459
So be sure not to.

189
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,660
Now for our last phrase.

190
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,139
So the pharmacist in the end wanted to check for the price and he said, just hang on there a sec.

191
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,720
So that's interesting.

192
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,939
Hang on.

193
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,839
Hang on.

194
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:11,600
Hang on.

195
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,800
Well, hang on.

196
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:14,319
What does he mean by hang on?

197
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,100
He means wait.

198
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:15,740
Wait.

199
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,959
It's an informal way of saying wait.

200
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:18,500
Exactly.

201
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,339
It's also a little bit more friendly than just saying wait.

202
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:21,879
Right.

203
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,399
Exactly.

204
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,620
And we can change the time a little bit, right?

205
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:25,980
Yeah.

206
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,139
So you can say hang on a second or hang on a moment.

207
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,180
Hang on a minute.

208
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:31,899
All right.

209
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,179
What about hang on an hour?

210
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,039
Well, maybe if you're telling someone to wait for an hour, just hang on there for an hour.

211
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,940
I'll be there soon.

212
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,059
Yeah, but I guess it's more common hang on a minute.

213
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,500
Right.

214
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,200
Maybe for shorter periods of time.

215
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Okay.

216
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,279
So what these phrases, I think now we can use them in different circumstances, obviously not only in the pharmacy.

217
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:49,679
Yeah.

218
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,080
And well, let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

219
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,419
Hello, sir.

220
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,539
How can I help you?

221
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:05,620
Yes, I need this prescription, please.

222
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,759
Let's see.

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,399
Okay.

224
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,799
So 50 milligrams of Prozac.

225
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,440
Would you prefer this in capsule or tablet?

226
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,299
Capsules are fine.

227
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:14,399
Okay.

228
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,080
You should take one capsule three times a day.

229
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,220
Be sure not to take it on an empty stomach and also don't ever mix it with alcohol.

230
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:23,539
Yes, I know.

231
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,200
It's not the first time I'm taking this.

232
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,039
Don't worry.

233
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:26,799
I won't overdose.

234
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,820
Okay.

235
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,960
Anything else I can get you?

236
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,720
Oh, yes.

237
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,639
I almost forgot.

238
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,080
Can I also get some eye drops and some condoms?

239
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:37,159
Sure.

240
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,080
Darn condoms aren't registered in our system.

241
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,360
Oh, well, that's okay.

242
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,220
I'll get some later.

243
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:43,580
Thanks.

244
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,159
Really?

245
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:44,840
It's no problem.

246
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,899
Just hang on there a sec.

247
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,559
Can I get a price check on fun times?

248
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,899
Ribbed condoms, please.

249
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:56,460
Okay.

250
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,840
So with medicine, an interesting thing comes up, right?

251
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,639
That's right.

252
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,659
A lot of people think that you eat medicine.

253
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,360
Okay.

254
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Or drink medicine.

255
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,840
Yeah.

256
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,440
But in English, you always take medicine.

257
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
Always take medicine.

258
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,139
Yeah.

259
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,919
So you never can say, oh, I ate my medicine yesterday.

260
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,120
It always like has to be, I took my medicine.

261
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:17,460
Okay.

262
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,779
You take the capsules.

263
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,460
Exactly.

264
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,720
Or take the tablets.

265
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:21,360
All right.

266
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,659
So you take medicine.

267
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,240
Now an interesting thing in the United States, for example, it's very hard to get medicine without a prescription.

268
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,200
That's right.

269
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,399
So we always talk about prescription medicine and OTC medicine or over the counter medicine.

270
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,320
So over the counter medicine is?

271
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Is medicine you can just buy without that prescription or note from your doctor.

272
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,019
Okay.

273
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,799
So for example, if you have a headache, you can go to the pharmacy and buy aspirin.

274
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,159
Yeah.

275
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,559
And that's over the counter medicine.

276
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:53,000
But prescription medicine, you can't get it without the doctor's note.

277
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,360
Yes.

278
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,740
And like you said, in America, you almost have to have a prescription for everything.

279
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,980
Which is strange because people can overdose on aspirin.

280
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,179
So tell us how medicine and pharmacies work in your countries.
