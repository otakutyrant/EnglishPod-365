00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:04,759
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,019 --> 00:00:05,820
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,640
And today we're going to be going to one of those places that is really common, right?

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,640
That's right, we're going to the hair salon.

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,420
The hair salon, or maybe also called a barbershop.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,460
I guess in this case it's a barbershop because it's a man who's getting his hair cut.

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:29,579
Okay, so before we see what happens in this barbershop, let's take a look at some of the vocabulary we might encounter in Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,780
Okay, we're going to look at two words that you'll hear in this dialogue.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,700
And the first one is trim.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:39,759
Trim.

12
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:40,600
A trim.

13
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:43,640
Alright, so when you trim something.

14
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:45,899
You cut just a little bit of it.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,359
Alright, so if I go to the hair salon to get a trim.

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,460
You are going to cut only a little bit of your hair.

17
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:52,920
Okay.

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,619
You're not going to change the style and make it look different.

19
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,299
Okay, so a trim.

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,920
And I think here we've seen that it can be a verb and a noun, right?

21
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:04,379
Okay, so I'm going to get a trim.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,760
Yes.

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,340
Or I want you to trim my hair.

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,040
That's right.

25
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:08,780
Alright.

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,599
And what about our next word?

27
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:11,659
Fancy.

28
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:12,659
Fancy.

29
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:13,359
Fancy.

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,040
So fancy.

31
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,819
Now, we know that this word maybe is related to something like luxury.

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,180
Or formal or something like that.

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,739
Right, but in this case or in this context we're going to be using it a little bit different.

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,379
That's right.

35
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,659
Here in this dialogue we'll hear nothing too fancy.

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,859
Or nothing too complicated.

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,260
Nothing too different.

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,939
Okay, so we don't want anything too fancy.

39
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:42,599
Alright, but with these two words in mind I think we're ready to listen to the dialogue.

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,200
Hello there.

41
00:01:58,739 --> 00:01:59,400
Come on in.

42
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:00,859
Don't just stand there.

43
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,299
Come and take a seat.

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,799
Um, okay.

45
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,099
Well, I just want a trim.

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,200
Nothing too fancy.

47
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,360
Oh my gosh.

48
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,500
Your hair is amazing.

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,159
So silky.

50
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,479
So shiny.

51
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,439
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,000
You hear me?

53
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,840
You are going to look like a million bucks.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,520
Okay.

55
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:31,180
Um, can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top.

56
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,379
Don't you worry.

57
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,180
I'll take care of everything.

58
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,060
Oh my god.

59
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,560
I just love your curly hair.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,120
It's so fluffy and cute.

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,539
You should totally let it grow out.

62
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,979
An afro would look great on you.

63
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,340
Um, no.

64
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,879
Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece.

65
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,479
Okay, so I think maybe his haircut is not quite what he expected.

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,419
I think he trusted the stylist a little bit too much.

67
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,580
I think the stylist had too many red bulls or something.

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,580
He was very hyper.

69
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,780
Maybe that was his problem.

70
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,599
Alright, so why don't we take a look now at some of the language that we saw in Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,680
Language Takeaway.

72
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,580
So I guess the stylist really thought this guy had nice hair, right?

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,080
Yeah, we heard how he described his hair.

74
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,759
He said it was so silky.

75
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,719
Silky.

76
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,379
Silky.

77
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,560
Alright, so we know the word silk.

78
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:52,039
Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
A material, very soft and smooth material.

80
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:58,620
And when something is silky, it's very soft and smooth.

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,479
Alright, so silky hair.

82
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,740
Or silky skin.

83
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,759
Alright, so silky.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,819
So he said he had silky and shiny hair.

85
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,479
Shiny.

86
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,159
Shiny.

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Shiny.

88
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,159
Alright, so we know what shiny is.

89
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:11,780
Do we?

90
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,560
Yes, we do.

91
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:13,460
Okay, what?

92
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,220
So something that is shiny is you can see yourself in it.

93
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,839
Like gold is shiny.

94
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,199
Or silver is shiny.

95
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,720
Alright, or if you look in the back of a CD, it's shiny.

96
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,519
Yeah, so the light bounces off things that are shiny.

97
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:37,620
Alright, now getting into more hairstyle vocabulary, he wanted to make sure that his sideburns were even.

98
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,220
Sideburns.

99
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,160
Alright, so sideburns.

100
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,259
Alright, well sideburns are things that men have, right?

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,019
Alright, women don't have sideburns.

102
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,180
No.

103
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,399
Okay, so it's kind of like a beard.

104
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,060
Mm-hmm.

105
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,420
And it's the hair that grows on your cheeks near your ears.

106
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,519
Okay, those are your sideburns.

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,680
Yes.

108
00:04:54,899 --> 00:05:00,899
And now also the hairstylist suggested that he should let his hair grow out.

109
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,040
Grow out.

110
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,720
Grow out.

111
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,160
Let your hair grow out.

112
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,540
Alright, so what does that mean exactly?

113
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,860
Let your hair get longer.

114
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,420
So you can say let your hair grow.

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:12,879
Yeah.

116
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,819
But I guess it's more common to hear let your hair grow out.

117
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,220
Well, maybe it just means something a little bit different.

118
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,939
If I let my hair grow, I might let it grow a little bit.

119
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,079
Make it a little bit longer.

120
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,800
But if I let my hair grow out, maybe it's short now and I'll let it get really long.

121
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,360
Okay.

122
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,660
So to let your hair grow out is to really change the length.

123
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,279
Alright, very good.

124
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,680
So let your hair grow out.

125
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,000
And our last word on language takeaway today, afro.

126
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:40,899
Afro.

127
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,939
Afro.

128
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,899
So if this guy let his curly hair grow out, he would have an afro.

129
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,000
An afro, right?

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,699
So now this hairstyle was very popular in the 70s.

131
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:58,720
That's right, it's like a big, round, curly, fluffy ball of hair.

132
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,360
Exactly.

133
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,980
So that's an afro.

134
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,160
We'll post some pictures on the website for you to get a clear idea of what this looks like.

135
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:10,300
Alright, so I think now we are ready to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,779
And then we'll come back and look at phrases.

137
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,399
Hello there.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,759
Come on in.

139
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,639
Don't just stand there.

140
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,360
Come and take a seat.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,759
Um, okay.

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,819
Well, I just want to trim nothing too fancy.

143
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:37,480
Oh my gosh, your hair is amazing.

144
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,939
So silky.

145
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,040
So shiny.

146
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:43,079
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

147
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:43,939
You hear me?

148
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,399
You are going to look like a million bucks.

149
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,300
Okay.

150
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,699
Um, can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top?

151
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't you worry.

152
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll take care of everything.

153
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,639
Oh my god.

154
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,879
I just love your curly hair.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,860
It's so fluffy and cute.

156
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,939
You should totally let it grow out.

157
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:06,060
An afro would look great on you.

158
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,540
Um, no.

159
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,660
Okay, but you're going to be my masterpiece.

160
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:24,480
Okay, so we have some phrases here that you might hear in a hair salon or in a barbershop.

161
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,740
So why don't we look at those now in Fluency Builder.

162
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,220
Fluency Builder.

163
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,920
The hair stylist said, don't just stand there.

164
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:34,600
Don't just stand there.

165
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,879
Alright, don't just stand there.

166
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,860
So this is an interesting phrase Marco.

167
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,540
I mean, it's made up of really simple words, right?

168
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:42,079
Right.

169
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,980
But actually those words make it in order that's a little bit different.

170
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:50,860
So why don't we hear a few examples to help us understand how to use this phrase.

171
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,379
Example one.

172
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,439
Don't just stand there.

173
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,620
Help me take these boxes into the house.

174
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:02,980
Example two.

175
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,439
The house is on fire.

176
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,620
Don't just stand there.

177
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,860
Call the fire department.

178
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,180
Example three.

179
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,160
Don't just stand there in the rain.

180
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,879
Come inside.

181
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:28,920
Okay, so basically we can understand that if somebody tells you don't just stand there, they are expecting you to do something.

182
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,259
We might use this phrase when somebody is not doing what we think they should do.

183
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,419
Okay, when action is required.

184
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,000
Exactly.

185
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,720
Okay, so why don't we move on to our next phrase now.

186
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,059
Look like a million bucks.

187
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,779
You look like a million bucks.

188
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,019
So when someone looks like a million bucks, they look really, really good.

189
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,519
Yeah.

190
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:55,259
So that is a very common way of just saying you look very good or something looks like a million bucks.

191
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,340
So it can be for a person or a thing, right?

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,820
Exactly.

193
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:03,779
Okay, and our final phrase, and this one is really common in barber shops.

194
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,080
Take a little off the top.

195
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,179
Take a little off the top.

196
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:09,240
Take a little off the top.

197
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,639
So that basically means cut a little bit on top.

198
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Exactly.

199
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,480
And now can I say take a little off the sides?

200
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:18,679
Yeah, you can say that as well.

201
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,980
All right, so take a little off the top.

202
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,700
Take a little off the sides.

203
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,100
Okay, so with all this great hair cutting language, why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time?

204
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:42,500
Hello there.

205
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:43,700
Come on in.

206
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:45,179
Don't just stand there.

207
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Come and take a seat.

208
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:47,980
Okay.

209
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,539
Well, I just want to trim nothing too fancy.

210
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,799
Oh my gosh, your hair is amazing.

211
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,460
So silky.

212
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,779
So shiny.

213
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,720
I am going to work my magic on your hair.

214
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:05,279
You hear me?

215
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,159
You are going to look like a million bucks.

216
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:09,820
Okay.

217
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:15,440
Can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top?

218
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,659
Don't you worry.

219
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:18,460
I'll take care of everything.

220
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,379
Oh my God.

221
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,899
I just love your curly hair.

222
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,399
It's so fluffy and cute.

223
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,820
You should totally let it grow out.

224
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,240
An afro would look great on you.

225
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,620
Um, no.

226
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,159
Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece.

227
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:05,240
All right, so now talking about hairstyles and different types of hair, there are some interesting ones that maybe aren't so fashionable anymore, right?

228
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:05,620
Yeah.

229
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,679
Um, actually English has a lot of really cool words to describe haircuts.

230
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,080
So let's start with a couple of them.

231
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,299
For example, a mullet.

232
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,399
A mullet.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,919
So this is when your hair is really short on top and really long in the back.

234
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,200
Right.

235
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,720
So the sides and the top part are really short, but the back you have long hair.

236
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,019
Yeah.

237
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,159
Um, in Canada we call that a shorty, shorty, long back.

238
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,860
Shorty, shorty, long back.

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah.

240
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,340
We also call it hockey hair.

241
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,120
Hockey hair.

242
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,799
Or even all business up front, all party behind.

243
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,600
Canadians are obviously very into this hairstyle.

244
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,799
It's unfortunately true.

245
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,039
All right.

246
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,960
We also have, for example, a mohawk.

247
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,799
Popular amongst the punk rock kids.

248
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:46,419
Exactly.

249
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:53,000
So you shave your head on the sides, but you leave a little like stripe of long hair on top.

250
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,039
Of sticking up long hair.

251
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,419
Okay.

252
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,360
And that's a mohawk.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,940
What about a flat top?

254
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,259
Oh, um, popular with law enforcement agents and serial killers.

255
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,820
So basically it's short hair on the sides.

256
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,440
And short and flat hair on the top.

257
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:08,659
Right.

258
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,139
So your hair.

259
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:09,860
Kind of looks like a box.

260
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:10,340
Right.

261
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,620
You have it's flat on kind of like your haircut.

262
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,120
I do not have a flat tub for all of you out there.

263
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,779
Uh, but I did used to have a crew cut.

264
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,679
Oh, crew cut a crew cut.

265
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,100
Yeah.

266
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,220
Like an army haircut.

267
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:22,659
Right.

268
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,039
So very short on the sides and a little bit long on top.

269
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:26,360
Yeah.

270
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:26,899
Okay.

271
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:34,080
Um, and our last one, my actual personal least favorite haircut, dreadlocks, dreadlocks.

272
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,600
All right.

273
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,460
So, so dreadlocks are like knots of hair.

274
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:37,879
Yeah.

275
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,720
Um, it looks like you haven't washed your hair in about seven years.

276
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:43,419
Right.

277
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,159
Those are dreadlocks.

278
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,519
Very popular among like Rastafarians.

279
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:48,299
Sure.

280
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,940
Or like, um, young hippie kids.

281
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,360
Yeah.

282
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,100
Hippies.

283
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,360
Right.

284
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:52,820
Very good.

285
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,100
So what about in your countries?

286
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,259
What different hairstyles are popular there?

287
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,740
I know that Japanese hairstyles are really cool.

288
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,600
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,399
Uh, Japanese haircuts can be pretty awesome.

290
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:01,860
Right.

291
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,059
