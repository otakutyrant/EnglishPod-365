00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,500
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:05,280
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,540
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,179
And today we're going to be taking you to the airport.

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,039
That's right.

7
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:16,140
We're going to listen as a man checks in at the airport and deals with his luggage.

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:17,339
That's right.

9
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,399
So we're going to be looking at a lot of great stuff that can help you the next time you are at the airport at the check-in counter.

10
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:28,859
So why don't we take a look at one word that we're going to preview today in vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,799
We're going to hear this guy say, I'd like to check three pieces.

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,859
He's going to check three pieces of what?

13
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:40,979
Pieces of luggage.

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,280
So when we talk about luggage, we can say pieces of luggage.

15
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:45,840
That's right.

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,640
Luggage is a non-count noun.

17
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:52,000
So you can't say one luggage, two luggages, three luggages.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,500
That's wrong.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,140
So we use pieces of luggage.

21
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:56,740
Okay.

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,880
So three pieces of luggage.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,359
Very good.

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,719
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,239
We're going to see what happens with this guy at the airport and with his pieces of luggage.

26
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,959
Next, please.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,439
Hello, sir.

28
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,799
May I see your passport, please?

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,359
Yes.

30
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:22,739
Here you go.

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,819
Will you be checking any bags today?

32
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:25,480
Yes.

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,760
I'd like to check three pieces.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm sorry, sir.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,560
Airline policy only allows two pieces of check luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

36
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,420
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

37
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:38,939
What?

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,760
Why?

39
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,799
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

41
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,200
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,900
That's absurd.

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,599
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,640
There's nothing I can do.

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,859
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

46
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,599
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,239
That bag is clearly too big.

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,200
Now I see.

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,640
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,400
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

51
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,819
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Let's see.

53
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,800
625 US dollars.

54
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:17,699
That's more than my round trip ticket.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,819
All right, well, that's a whole lot of money, isn't it?

56
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,520
Well, I think it's a very common situation.

57
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,180
I'm sure many of our listeners can relate to this situation.

58
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,939
Overweight charges are pretty expensive.

59
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:37,860
Very high.

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,300
I know from personal experience.

61
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,439
But that's not what we want to talk about now.

62
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:45,840
We want to talk about some really useful vocabulary in Language Takeaway.

63
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,599
Language Takeaway All right, on Language Takeaway today we have five words.

64
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,400
So why don't we start with the first one?

65
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,460
So the woman asked, will you be checking any bags today?

66
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,360
Will you be checking any bags today?

67
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,060
To check bags.

68
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,500
Right.

69
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:06,300
So the verb to check.

70
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,379
It means to give your bags to the airline, to register them.

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,979
Okay.

72
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,979
So that's what happens with your luggage.

73
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:15,979
You check them.

74
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:18,800
So basically they become responsible for your bags.

75
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,080
Right.

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,520
It reminds me of checking into a hotel.

77
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:23,020
Right.

78
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,719
Very similar.

79
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,460
When you go to a hotel, you register at the hotel.

80
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:27,520
You check in.

81
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:30,419
In this case, you just check your luggage.

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
You don't check in your luggage.

83
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:31,939
Right.

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,400
Okay.

85
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,800
So check luggage.

86
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,360
So he wanted to check three pieces of luggage.

87
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,840
And he also had carry on luggage.

88
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:41,180
Carry on luggage.

89
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,259
Carry on.

90
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,419
So carry on luggage.

91
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,319
It's pretty simple.

92
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:45,840
That's right.

93
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,419
You carry it on yourself.

94
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:48,099
Exactly.

95
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,080
You carry it onto the plane.

96
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,280
Now we can talk about carry on luggage, right?

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
Or carry on bag.

98
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,400
Or a carry on suitcase.

99
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,300
A very small suitcase that can fit under your seat.

100
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,659
All right.

101
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,280
So carry on luggage.

102
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,680
Now he was traveling on an intercontinental flight.

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,199
Intercontinental.

104
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,780
Intercontinental.

105
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,539
We have two words there.

106
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:12,900
Inter.

107
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Between.

108
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:14,819
Between, right?

109
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:15,919
And continental.

110
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,120
So this sounds like continent.

111
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:18,899
Okay.

112
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,319
So he's traveling maybe from Asia to North America.

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,819
Okay.

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,959
Intercontinental.

115
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,480
He's trying to board this intercontinental flight.

116
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,300
So to board a flight.

117
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,680
Board a plane.

118
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,079
Board a train.

119
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:35,939
All right.

120
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:37,660
So basically it means to...

121
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,139
To get on.

122
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:38,740
To get on.

123
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,800
To get on a vehicle.

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,379
Okay.

125
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:41,959
So I can say board the ship.

126
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,639
Board the car.

127
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,639
No.

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:44,779
No.

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,660
But board the train.

130
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,680
Board the train.

131
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,420
Board the bus.

132
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,240
All aboard.

133
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,160
That's right.

134
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:57,060
That's why in movies you see that somebody will yell all aboard in the train station, right?

135
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Exactly.

136
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,279
All aboard.

137
00:04:58,939 --> 00:04:59,339
Okay.

138
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,319
So board a vehicle.

139
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,920
And our last phrase for today.

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,639
Overhead compartment.

141
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
Overhead compartment.

142
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,160
Overhead compartment.

143
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,339
All right.

144
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,439
Let's break this phrase down.

145
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,680
Overhead.

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,480
So that's on top of your head, right?

147
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,920
Above you.

148
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,620
And the compartment is a place where you can put something and store it.

149
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:24,860
Kind of like a box.

150
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:25,480
Right.

151
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:25,819
Yeah.

152
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,819
So you have an overhead compartment.

153
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,660
That big box where you put your bags and your purse or whatever on an airplane.

154
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,180
Very similar to, for example, an overhead projector.

155
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,759
Right.

156
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,420
So that's the machine that puts an image or a picture on a wall.

157
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,939
Like sometimes you see them in meetings.

158
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:42,560
Right.

159
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,480
So because the image is over your head and it's big, it's called an overhead projector.

160
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,899
So some great language.

161
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,459
Why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for the second time.

162
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,379
Next please.

163
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,959
Hello, sir.

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,439
May I see your passport, please?

165
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,459
Yes.

166
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,399
Here you go.

167
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,480
Will you be checking any bags today?

168
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,399
Yes.

169
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,040
I'd like to check three pieces.

170
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,079
I'm sorry, sir.

171
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:24,959
Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at 20 kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

172
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,180
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

173
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,300
What?

174
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,379
Why?

175
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

176
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,540
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

177
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,699
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

178
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,620
That's absurd.

179
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,459
I'm sorry, sir.

180
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,339
There's nothing I can do.

181
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:49,860
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

182
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,199
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

183
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,980
That bag is clearly too big.

184
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,360
Now I see.

185
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:10,360
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

186
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,899
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all this?

187
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,800
Let's see.

188
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,699
625 U.S.

189
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:20,199
dollars.

190
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,259
That's more than my round-trip ticket.

191
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:36,019
All right, so I think it's a little bit more clear now, and with this, it's time for us to take a look at some great phrases in putting it together.

192
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,120
Putting it together.

193
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,339
So this guy was pretty angry about this airline policy, and he said, how am I supposed to?

194
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,699
How am I supposed to?

195
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
How am I supposed to?

196
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,879
Okay, so before we get into explaining this, why don't we listen to a couple of examples so we can try and understand what it means.

197
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,120
Example one.

198
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,579
How am I supposed to fit the dog in the car?

199
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,360
There are 10 people in there already.

200
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:11,540
Example two.

201
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,379
How is she supposed to get to work if her car is in the shop?

202
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:20,500
Example three.

203
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,139
How are we supposed to know the answer to that?

204
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,060
It's impossible.

205
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,700
Okay, so I can understand that it means, how can I do this?

206
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,179
How do you expect me to do this?

207
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,200
How is it possible for me to do this?

208
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,940
Very good.

209
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:40,379
It's a phrase you use when you're frustrated, right?

210
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,259
Yeah, exactly.

211
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,080
You're maybe a little bit frustrated, or you're maybe nervous of something that you can't do or don't know how.

212
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:53,940
Yeah, this phrase, it's not impolite, but it sort of gives the idea that you're challenging the other person a little bit.

213
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,840
Maybe, yeah.

214
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,879
Okay, so a good phrase that you can use in different situations, and you can try and mix it up with different verbs, right?

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,139
Right.

216
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,059
Alright, now let's take a look at our next phrase.

217
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,779
I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing I can do.

218
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,539
There's nothing I can do.

219
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,500
There's nothing I can do.

220
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,519
There's nothing I can do.

221
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,299
So basically, the woman can't help the man, even though he's insisting and he's pushing that he wants another solution, right?

222
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,740
So finally, she says, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

223
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,620
So we use this phrase when someone's pushing you too much, right?

224
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,539
Right, and you would use it only in that situation towards the end, because it is a little bit...

225
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:36,340
It's strong.

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,799
It's not impolite, but it's just, you're saying, you know what, I'm sorry, I can't do anything about it.

227
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,220
Now let's move on to our third phrase.

228
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,840
You charge next to nothing.

229
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,759
Next to nothing.

230
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,700
Next to nothing.

231
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,440
Next to nothing.

232
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,340
Alright, so we're talking about charging, we're talking about money.

233
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,320
Why don't we listen to some examples of what this next to nothing phrase means?

234
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:02,840
Example one.

235
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,200
Do you like my new house?

236
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:09,639
It was so cheap that it almost cost next to nothing.

237
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,700
Example two.

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,080
Let's go to Thailand.

239
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Example one.

240
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,720
Tickets cost next to nothing right now.

241
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,179
Example three.

242
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,220
The real estate agent charged me next to nothing for his commission, so I got a really good deal.

243
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,519
So when something costs next to nothing, it's really cheap, right?

244
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,559
It's really cheap, or you consider it to be cheap.

245
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:44,120
And now, for our last phrase, it's the complete opposite of next to nothing.

246
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:44,600
Right.

247
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,039
Charge an arm and a leg.

248
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,919
An arm and a leg.

249
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,259
An arm and a leg.

250
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,460
Alright, so this means it's really expensive.

251
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,980
It's so expensive, it's like giving your arm and your leg.

252
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Right, to pay for it.

253
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,759
Very good, so next to nothing, really cheap.

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,440
An arm and a leg, really expensive.

255
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:05,919
Can we look at the use here?

256
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:13,580
Alright, so in the dialogue we heard, you charge an arm and a leg, but we can also say it costs an arm and a leg.

257
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:16,539
Right, because we are referring to money, right?

258
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,240
Alright, so some great phrases here.

259
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,980
Now, I think it's time we listen to our dialogue one more time.

260
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:31,340
Next, please.

261
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,820
Hello, sir.

262
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,200
May I see your passport, please?

263
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,159
Yes, here you go.

264
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,179
Will you be checking any bags today?

265
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,120
Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,940
I'm sorry, sir.

267
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,159
Airline policy only allows two pieces of checked luggage.

268
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,899
At 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

269
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:51,820
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

270
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:52,320
What?

271
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,120
Why?

272
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:55,159
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

273
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:57,519
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

274
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,580
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

275
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,279
That's absurd.

276
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,980
I'm sorry, sir.

277
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,019
There's nothing I can do.

278
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,240
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

279
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,980
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

280
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,659
That bag is clearly too big.

281
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,559
Now I see.

282
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,019
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

283
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,759
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

284
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,220
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

285
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,120
Let's see.

286
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,179
Six hundred twenty-five US dollars.

287
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:31,059
That's more than my round-trip ticket.

288
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,480
Okay, so airline policies, luggage, it's always a problem, right?

289
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,000
Most of the time you always end up paying overweight when you travel.

290
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,639
Yeah, I know that this happened to me once and it was really expensive.

291
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Really?

292
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,779
What happened?

293
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,740
I was flying on an intercontinental flight from India back to Europe.

294
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:56,379
And I had too many extra bags, but I really needed to bring them.

295
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,779
And so it cost me six thousand dollars.

296
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,580
Six thousand dollars.

297
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,279
Wow.

298
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,159
So my credit card was pretty maxed out after that.

299
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:06,820
That's incredible.

300
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:12,000
