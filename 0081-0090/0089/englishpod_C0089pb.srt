00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're going to be taking you to the airport.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're going to listen as a man checks in at the airport and deals with his luggage.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we're going to be looking at a lot of great stuff that can help you the next time you are at the airport at the check-in counter.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So why don't we take a look at one word that we're going to preview today in vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're going to hear this guy say, I'd like to check three pieces.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He's going to check three pieces of what?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Pieces of luggage.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So when we talk about luggage, we can say pieces of luggage.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's right.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Luggage is a non-count noun.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So you can't say one luggage, two luggages, three luggages.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's wrong.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So we use pieces of luggage.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So three pieces of luggage.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Very good.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're going to see what happens with this guy at the airport and with his pieces of luggage.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Next, please.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hello, sir.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
May I see your passport, please?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Here you go.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Will you be checking any bags today?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'd like to check three pieces.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, sir.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Airline policy only allows two pieces of check luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why?

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's absurd.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry, sir.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's nothing I can do.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That bag is clearly too big.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now I see.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's see.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
625 US dollars.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's more than my round trip ticket.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All right, well, that's a whole lot of money, isn't it?

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, I think it's a very common situation.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sure many of our listeners can relate to this situation.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Overweight charges are pretty expensive.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Very high.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I know from personal experience.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But that's not what we want to talk about now.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We want to talk about some really useful vocabulary in Language Takeaway.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Language Takeaway All right, on Language Takeaway today we have five words.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So why don't we start with the first one?

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So the woman asked, will you be checking any bags today?

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Will you be checking any bags today?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To check bags.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So the verb to check.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It means to give your bags to the airline, to register them.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So that's what happens with your luggage.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You check them.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So basically they become responsible for your bags.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right.

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It reminds me of checking into a hotel.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Right.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Very similar.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
When you go to a hotel, you register at the hotel.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You check in.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In this case, you just check your luggage.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't check in your luggage.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So check luggage.

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So he wanted to check three pieces of luggage.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And he also had carry on luggage.

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Carry on luggage.

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Carry on.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So carry on luggage.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's pretty simple.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's right.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You carry it on yourself.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Exactly.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You carry it onto the plane.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Now we can talk about carry on luggage, right?

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Or carry on bag.

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Or a carry on suitcase.

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A very small suitcase that can fit under your seat.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right.

101
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So carry on luggage.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Now he was traveling on an intercontinental flight.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Intercontinental.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Intercontinental.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We have two words there.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Inter.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Between.

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Between, right?

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And continental.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So this sounds like continent.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So he's traveling maybe from Asia to North America.

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Intercontinental.

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He's trying to board this intercontinental flight.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So to board a flight.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Board a plane.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Board a train.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All right.

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So basically it means to...

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To get on.

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To get on.

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
To get on a vehicle.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay.

125
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So I can say board the ship.

126
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Board the car.

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No.

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But board the train.

130
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Board the train.

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Board the bus.

132
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
All aboard.

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's why in movies you see that somebody will yell all aboard in the train station, right?

135
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Exactly.

136
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All aboard.

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

138
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So board a vehicle.

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And our last phrase for today.

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Overhead compartment.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Overhead compartment.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Overhead compartment.

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's break this phrase down.

145
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Overhead.

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So that's on top of your head, right?

147
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Above you.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the compartment is a place where you can put something and store it.

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Kind of like a box.

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right.

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah.

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So you have an overhead compartment.

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That big box where you put your bags and your purse or whatever on an airplane.

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Very similar to, for example, an overhead projector.

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Right.

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So that's the machine that puts an image or a picture on a wall.

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Like sometimes you see them in meetings.

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right.

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So because the image is over your head and it's big, it's called an overhead projector.

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So some great language.

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why don't we hear it again in context by listening to the dialogue for the second time.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Next please.

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hello, sir.

164
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
May I see your passport, please?

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here you go.

167
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Will you be checking any bags today?

168
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'd like to check three pieces.

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry, sir.

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Airline policy allows only two pieces of checked luggage at 20 kilograms each, plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

172
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What?

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why?

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's absurd.

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry, sir.

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There's nothing I can do.

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

183
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That bag is clearly too big.

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now I see.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

186
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all this?

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's see.

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
625 U.S.

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
dollars.

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's more than my round-trip ticket.

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right, so I think it's a little bit more clear now, and with this, it's time for us to take a look at some great phrases in putting it together.

192
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Putting it together.

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So this guy was pretty angry about this airline policy, and he said, how am I supposed to?

194
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How am I supposed to?

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How am I supposed to?

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay, so before we get into explaining this, why don't we listen to a couple of examples so we can try and understand what it means.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Example one.

198
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How am I supposed to fit the dog in the car?

199
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There are 10 people in there already.

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Example two.

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How is she supposed to get to work if her car is in the shop?

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Example three.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
How are we supposed to know the answer to that?

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's impossible.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, so I can understand that it means, how can I do this?

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How do you expect me to do this?

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
How is it possible for me to do this?

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Very good.

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's a phrase you use when you're frustrated, right?

210
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah, exactly.

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're maybe a little bit frustrated, or you're maybe nervous of something that you can't do or don't know how.

212
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah, this phrase, it's not impolite, but it sort of gives the idea that you're challenging the other person a little bit.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Maybe, yeah.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, so a good phrase that you can use in different situations, and you can try and mix it up with different verbs, right?

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Right.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Alright, now let's take a look at our next phrase.

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing I can do.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There's nothing I can do.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
There's nothing I can do.

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There's nothing I can do.

221
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So basically, the woman can't help the man, even though he's insisting and he's pushing that he wants another solution, right?

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So finally, she says, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So we use this phrase when someone's pushing you too much, right?

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right, and you would use it only in that situation towards the end, because it is a little bit...

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's strong.

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not impolite, but it's just, you're saying, you know what, I'm sorry, I can't do anything about it.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now let's move on to our third phrase.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You charge next to nothing.

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Next to nothing.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Next to nothing.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Next to nothing.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Alright, so we're talking about charging, we're talking about money.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why don't we listen to some examples of what this next to nothing phrase means?

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Example one.

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you like my new house?

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It was so cheap that it almost cost next to nothing.

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Example two.

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go to Thailand.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Example one.

240
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Tickets cost next to nothing right now.

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Example three.

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The real estate agent charged me next to nothing for his commission, so I got a really good deal.

243
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So when something costs next to nothing, it's really cheap, right?

244
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's really cheap, or you consider it to be cheap.

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And now, for our last phrase, it's the complete opposite of next to nothing.

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Right.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Charge an arm and a leg.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
An arm and a leg.

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
An arm and a leg.

250
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Alright, so this means it's really expensive.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's so expensive, it's like giving your arm and your leg.

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Right, to pay for it.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Very good, so next to nothing, really cheap.

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
An arm and a leg, really expensive.

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Can we look at the use here?

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Alright, so in the dialogue we heard, you charge an arm and a leg, but we can also say it costs an arm and a leg.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right, because we are referring to money, right?

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Alright, so some great phrases here.

259
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Now, I think it's time we listen to our dialogue one more time.

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Next, please.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Hello, sir.

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
May I see your passport, please?

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, here you go.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Will you be checking any bags today?

265
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

266
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry, sir.

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Airline policy only allows two pieces of checked luggage.

268
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
At 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

270
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why?

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's absurd.

276
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry, sir.

277
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's nothing I can do.

278
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That bag is clearly too big.

281
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now I see.

282
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

283
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

285
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's see.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Six hundred twenty-five US dollars.

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's more than my round-trip ticket.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay, so airline policies, luggage, it's always a problem, right?

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Most of the time you always end up paying overweight when you travel.

290
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, I know that this happened to me once and it was really expensive.

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Really?

292
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What happened?

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I was flying on an intercontinental flight from India back to Europe.

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And I had too many extra bags, but I really needed to bring them.

295
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And so it cost me six thousand dollars.

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Six thousand dollars.

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wow.

298
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So my credit card was pretty maxed out after that.

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's incredible.

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
