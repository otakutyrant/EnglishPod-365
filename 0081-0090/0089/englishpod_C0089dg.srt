1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:08,839
Next please.

2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:11,720
Hello sir, may I see your passport please?

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,619
Yes, here you go.

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,740
Will you be checking any bags today?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,640
Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:26,500
I'm sorry sir, airline policy only allows two pieces of check luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,399
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

8
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:29,859
What?

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,679
Why?

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,679
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,100
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:38,859
That's absurd.

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,579
I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I can do.

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,780
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:48,500
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,140
That bag is clearly too big.

18
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,100
Now I see.

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,560
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,320
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

21
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,759
So tell me miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

22
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:06,700
Let's see, 625 US dollars.

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,599
That's more than my round trip ticket!
