1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next please.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello sir, may I see your passport please?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, here you go.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Will you be checking any bags today?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, I'd like to check three pieces.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry sir, airline policy only allows two pieces of check luggage at 20 kilograms each plus one piece of carry-on luggage.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I will have to charge you extra for the additional suitcase.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Why?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm taking an intercontinental flight.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm flying 16,000 kilometers.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How am I supposed to take only two 20 kilo bags?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's absurd.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I can do.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You cannot board the flight with that large bag either.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Carry-on bags must fit in the overhead compartment or under your seat.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That bag is clearly too big.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now I see.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You charge next to nothing for an international ticket.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So tell me miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's see, 625 US dollars.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's more than my round trip ticket!
