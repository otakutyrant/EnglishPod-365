1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:07,339
Welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,160
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,119
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,119
And today we're going to be getting money.

6
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:12,019
That's right.

7
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:14,660
We're going to have a lesson about the ATM.

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,100
The ATM or?

9
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,500
Automatic Teller Machine.

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,179
Okay, that's what it stands for.

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:20,859
ATM.

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,839
So we're going to be looking at the language that you'll probably find in an ATM maybe in the United States or an English-speaking country.

13
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:29,699
That's right.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,039
But before we begin, why don't we look at some vocabulary that we'll hear in the dialogue.

15
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,179
Vocabulary Preview.

16
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:43,619
As we mentioned, the ATM or Automatic Teller Machine is a machine where you get your money, right?

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,259
Exactly.

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,259
And also, well, some people are in different places.

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,039
They may call it the bank machine.

20
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,100
Yeah, or maybe the cash machine.

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,640
Or just the money machine or something.

22
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:54,920
All right.

23
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,000
So ATM.

24
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:56,619
ATM.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,359
And now let's take a look at our next word.

26
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,060
Local authorities.

27
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,920
The local authorities.

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,040
The local authorities.

29
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,159
So what are the local authorities?

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,099
Well, basically it's the police.

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:08,760
The police.

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,560
Why do you say local authorities?

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,540
Okay, well, authority is the person in charge, right?

34
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,239
The boss.

35
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,879
So the local authorities are basically the people who are the boss of this place.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,620
In that area.

37
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:20,980
Yeah.

38
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,000
So the police.

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,200
The local authorities.

40
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,700
So why don't we start now with our dialogue?

41
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:29,040
Why are we talking about local authorities and ATM machines?

42
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:29,560
I don't know.

43
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,219
We got to listen to find out.

44
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:59,280
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,900
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,539
I know what I selected.

47
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,599
Just give me money.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,259
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

49
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,379
Thank you.

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,159
You want to transfer 10,000 US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

51
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,460
If this is correct, please press one.

52
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,419
No, no.

53
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,379
Stupid machine.

54
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,020
What are you doing?

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,419
No.

56
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,520
Confirmed.

57
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,419
Thank you for using our bank.

58
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,620
Please remove your card from the slot.

59
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:37,360
Goodbye.

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,439
No way.

61
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,159
What happened?

62
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,479
Give me my money.

63
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:42,120
Danger.

64
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:42,900
Danger.

65
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,819
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

66
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,479
Thank you for using our bank.

67
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:51,639
Have a nice day.

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,240
No.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,180
All right.

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
So it's not his day today.

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,939
I think he was very unlucky and maybe he's going to be in trouble.

72
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:06,659
I know.

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,900
And he was on a date.

74
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,340
This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to a guy when he's on a date.

75
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:11,759
All right.

76
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,060
Yes.

77
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:18,379
So, well, we saw some of the language that was related to an ATM money and banking.

78
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,780
So why don't we take a look at that now in language takeaway?

79
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,919
Language takeaway.

80
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,080
All right.

81
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,919
So the guy had to insert his card into the slot.

82
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:31,599
Okay.

83
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
So slot.

84
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:33,939
Slot.

85
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,080
All right.

86
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:35,500
Slot.

87
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:37,780
And that is an opening, right?

88
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,139
Or a type of hole maybe.

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,439
Yeah.

90
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,099
It's a hole that is usually long.

91
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,280
Long and it's like a rectangular hole.

92
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:44,539
Yeah.

93
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,219
It's a slot is never a circle.

94
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:46,800
Okay.

95
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:52,280
So for example, when you get mail, the mailman will put it into your mailbox through the slot.

96
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:52,979
That's right.

97
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,580
Okay.

98
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,979
Well, and now that he put his card into the slot, he had to input a six digit pin code.

99
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,439
I want to just do both together.

100
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:03,219
Digit and pin code.

101
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:03,419
Yeah.

102
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:03,919
Okay.

103
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,400
So a six digit pin code.

104
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:06,919
All right.

105
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:08,840
Now we have two words here that are new.

106
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,599
Digit.

107
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,560
Digit is basically a number between zero and nine.

108
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,099
Okay.

109
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,620
So any number between zero and nine is considered a digit.

110
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,060
Yes.

111
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,500
So 100 is made up of three digits.

112
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,360
Three digits.

113
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,839
Okay.

114
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,779
And what about pin code?

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,899
A pin code is your secret number that you use to take money out.

116
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,100
Now, why wouldn't we say password?

117
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,420
Password is usually letters.

118
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:34,019
Okay.

119
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,639
And pin code is numbers.

120
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,120
Exactly.

121
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,899
All right.

122
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,980
He had to input his six digit pin code.

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,399
And then after that he had to press the pound key.

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,680
Pound key.

125
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,839
Now this is strange.

126
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,720
A pound key.

127
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:48,259
What is that?

128
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,879
Well, you know, on a phone.

129
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,480
Mm-hmm.

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,819
On the bottom right.

131
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,439
Uh-huh.

132
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,240
There's a key or a button that looks like a number sign.

133
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:57,980
Number sign.

134
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,519
So kind of like two vertical lines and two horizontal lines.

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:01,680
Yeah.

136
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,060
Two lines going up and down.

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,120
Two lines going across.

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:04,740
Okay.

139
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,480
So that's called the pound key.

140
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,040
Mm-hmm.

141
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,579
All right.

142
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:08,860
What about the other one?

143
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:09,980
It's called the star.

144
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,279
The star key.

145
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,139
The star key.

146
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:12,540
All right.

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,899
So after the pin code, after the pound key, now he's ready to withdraw money.

148
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:18,579
Mm-hmm.

149
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,220
So we heard withdrawal.

150
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,079
Okay.

151
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,699
So withdrawal is?

152
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:23,819
Is a noun.

153
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,160
It's the action of taking money out.

154
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:26,779
Okay.

155
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,819
A withdrawal.

156
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,720
A withdrawal.

157
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,319
Okay.

158
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,259
And to withdraw.

159
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,300
To withdraw is just the verb.

160
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,540
To take out money.

161
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:34,939
Exactly.

162
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:36,800
So we have the noun and the verb.

163
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,639
The only difference is an L at the end.

164
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:38,879
Yes.

165
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:42,100
So withdrawal noun and withdraw verb.

166
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:42,759
Okay.

167
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:51,360
And well he wanted to withdraw money but something happened with the ATM and it turned out that he was gonna transfer money.

168
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:52,000
Uh-oh.

169
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,879
So transfer.

170
00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:54,699
Transfer.

171
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,040
Transfer.

172
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,019
When you transfer money, you take it from one place and put it in another.

173
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:00,779
Okay.

174
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:04,759
And usually in banking when you transfer money you don't really see it, right?

175
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,259
Exactly.

176
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:11,019
It's all electronic so you just put it from one bank account to another but you never actually see this money.

177
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:11,480
Exactly.

178
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
So transfer money.

179
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,420
Transfer.

180
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,079
And now this one also has a verb and a noun, right?

181
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:16,740
Right.

182
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,540
A transfer.

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,819
And to transfer.

184
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:19,980
Same word.

185
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:20,379
Yep.

186
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:20,800
Easy.

187
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,860
Alright so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time.

188
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,379
It's gonna be slowed down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

189
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,779
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

190
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,660
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

191
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:43,639
Hello.

192
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,379
Welcome to Universal Bank.

193
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,920
Please insert your card into the slot.

194
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,100
I know where to put my card.

195
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,339
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

196
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,600
Please input your six-digit PIN code followed by the pound key.

197
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:56,819
Thank you.

198
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,500
Please select an option.

199
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,639
Thank you.

200
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,860
You have selected withdraw.

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,180
Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected.

202
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,220
Just give me my money.

203
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,959
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

204
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,920
Thank you.

205
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:17,079
You want to transfer ten thousand US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

206
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,819
If this is correct, please press one.

207
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,920
No, no.

208
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,899
Stupid machine.

209
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,540
What are you doing?

210
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:22,939
No.

211
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,000
Confirmed.

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,040
Thank you for using our bank.

213
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,399
Please remove your card from the slot.

214
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,139
Goodbye.

215
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,300
No way.

216
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,000
What happened?

217
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,300
Give me my money.

218
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,319
Danger.

219
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:34,120
Danger.

220
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,360
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

221
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,120
Thank you for using our bank.

222
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,319
Have a nice day.

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No.

224
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,459
Okay, so that was a little easier to understand.

225
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:02,259
But Marco, there's some interesting phrases here, some instructions that you commonly read or hear when you're using a bank machine.

226
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:05,040
So why don't we take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

227
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,579
Fluency Builder.

228
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,060
Well, the bank machine told this guy to insert your card.

229
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,920
Insert your card.

230
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,220
Insert your card.

231
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,199
So this verb, to insert, to place inside.

232
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,019
Exactly.

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,379
So what else can we insert?

234
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,360
Well, for example, commonly you insert a disk.

235
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,399
Yeah, in your computer.

236
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,160
In your computer.

237
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,540
Yep.

238
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,100
Or maybe insert a CD into your CD player.

239
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Or DVD into your DVD player.

240
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:35,419
Yep.

241
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,399
Alright, so to insert something, to put inside.

242
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

243
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,299
So he had to insert his card into the slot.

244
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,200
And then the bank machine asked him to select an option.

245
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,919
Select an option.

246
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,840
Select an option.

247
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,519
Now this is a very common phrase that you will not only see in ATMs but basically everywhere, right?

248
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,379
Like in computers or the internet or many things where you're dealing with machines.

249
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,580
So it's an order that says, well, select one of these choices that you have.

250
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,259
Make a choice.

251
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,059
Make a choice.

252
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:09,519
Yeah.

253
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,919
Select an option.

254
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,480
Alright, so two simple phrases but very useful and also very high frequency, right?

255
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,500
Yeah, and you know what?

256
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:21,559
When you use phrases like these two, it sounds quite professional, doesn't it?

257
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,899
Yeah, a little bit formal.

258
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:36,899
Okay, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

259
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,279
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

260
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,200
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

261
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,820
Hello, welcome to Universal Bank.

262
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,220
Please insert your card into the slot.

263
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,419
I know where to put my card.

264
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,639
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

265
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,759
Please input your six digit pin code followed by the pound key.

266
00:09:58,259 --> 00:09:58,879
Thank you.

267
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,460
Please select an option.

268
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,539
Thank you.

269
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,639
You have selected withdraw.

270
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,919
Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected.

271
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,019
Just give me my money.

272
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,659
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

273
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,740
Thank you.

274
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:20,559
You want to transfer 10,000 US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,820
If this is correct, please press one.

276
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:23,779
No, no.

277
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,740
Stupid machine.

278
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,399
What are you doing?

279
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:25,799
No.

280
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,919
Confirmed.

281
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,799
Thank you for using our bank.

282
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:31,019
Please remove your card from the slot.

283
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,740
Goodbye.

284
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:32,860
No way.

285
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,539
What happened?

286
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,919
Give me my money.

287
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,480
Danger.

288
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,279
Danger.

289
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,200
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

290
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,879
Thank you for using our bank.

291
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,019
Have a nice day.

292
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:46,580
No.

293
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,779
All right, Erica.

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,940
So what about you?

295
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,340
Have you ever had any problems with the ATM?

296
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,919
I've had more problems than I can count.

297
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,220
What happened?

298
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,279
Well, I think in the last two years I've probably lost about seven bank cards in an ATM.

299
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:06,820
Really?

300
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:07,620
You forget it.

301
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:07,940
Yes.

302
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,620
In the slot.

303
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,340
I leave it in the slot and then walk away from the bank machine and no bank cards.

304
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:26,399
Well, I think now the ATMs, because this is a common problem, now they have like a little alarm that when you take out your money and everything, it just starts beeping and beeping until you take out your card.

305
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:26,779
Yes.

306
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,659
And I like the bank machines that actually give you your card first and then give you your money.

307
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,379
Because if they give me my money first, that's all I want, right?

308
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,100
So I run away with my money and leave my card in the bank machine.

309
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,259
Right.

310
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,360
I think that's a good idea.

311
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:41,240
I've never seen it before, though.

312
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,820
In Switzerland, they have them like that.

313
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,879
Or what about the ATMs that you only have to swipe your card?

314
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, yeah, I've done that as well and also ruined a bank card with that.

315
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,700
I've swiped it too many times, put in the wrong PIN code and it blocks your card.

316
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,399
Yeah, terrible.

317
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,480
Well, what about you guys?

318
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:02,720
I'm sure everyone has some experience or some inconvenience with ATM machines.

319
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,419
So why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it?

320
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,860
You can also find lots more resources on our website to help you learn English.

321
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,960
So check it out.

322
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:14,299
And until next time, goodbye.
