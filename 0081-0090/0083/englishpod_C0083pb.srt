1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Welcome back to another great lesson here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be getting money.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're going to have a lesson about the ATM.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The ATM or?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Automatic Teller Machine.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, that's what it stands for.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
ATM.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we're going to be looking at the language that you'll probably find in an ATM maybe in the United States or an English-speaking country.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But before we begin, why don't we look at some vocabulary that we'll hear in the dialogue.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Vocabulary Preview.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
As we mentioned, the ATM or Automatic Teller Machine is a machine where you get your money, right?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Exactly.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And also, well, some people are in different places.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They may call it the bank machine.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, or maybe the cash machine.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Or just the money machine or something.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
All right.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So ATM.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
ATM.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And now let's take a look at our next word.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Local authorities.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The local authorities.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The local authorities.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So what are the local authorities?

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, basically it's the police.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The police.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why do you say local authorities?

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, well, authority is the person in charge, right?

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The boss.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So the local authorities are basically the people who are the boss of this place.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In that area.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So the police.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The local authorities.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So why don't we start now with our dialogue?

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are we talking about local authorities and ATM machines?

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't know.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We got to listen to find out.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I know what I selected.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just give me money.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You want to transfer 10,000 US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If this is correct, please press one.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, no.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stupid machine.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you doing?

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Confirmed.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you for using our bank.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Please remove your card from the slot.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Goodbye.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No way.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What happened?

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Give me my money.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Danger.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Danger.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Thank you for using our bank.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Have a nice day.

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So it's not his day today.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think he was very unlucky and maybe he's going to be in trouble.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I know.

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And he was on a date.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is probably one of the worst things that can happen to a guy when he's on a date.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, well, we saw some of the language that was related to an ATM money and banking.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So why don't we take a look at that now in language takeaway?

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Language takeaway.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So the guy had to insert his card into the slot.

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So slot.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Slot.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All right.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Slot.

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And that is an opening, right?

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or a type of hole maybe.

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's a hole that is usually long.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Long and it's like a rectangular hole.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a slot is never a circle.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So for example, when you get mail, the mailman will put it into your mailbox through the slot.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, and now that he put his card into the slot, he had to input a six digit pin code.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I want to just do both together.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Digit and pin code.

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So a six digit pin code.

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All right.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now we have two words here that are new.

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Digit.

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Digit is basically a number between zero and nine.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So any number between zero and nine is considered a digit.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So 100 is made up of three digits.

112
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Three digits.

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And what about pin code?

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A pin code is your secret number that you use to take money out.

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now, why wouldn't we say password?

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Password is usually letters.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And pin code is numbers.

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Exactly.

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right.

122
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He had to input his six digit pin code.

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And then after that he had to press the pound key.

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Pound key.

125
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Now this is strange.

126
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A pound key.

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What is that?

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, you know, on a phone.

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mm-hmm.

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
On the bottom right.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Uh-huh.

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's a key or a button that looks like a number sign.

133
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Number sign.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So kind of like two vertical lines and two horizontal lines.

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah.

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Two lines going up and down.

137
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Two lines going across.

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So that's called the pound key.

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mm-hmm.

141
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
All right.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What about the other one?

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's called the star.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The star key.

145
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The star key.

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right.

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So after the pin code, after the pound key, now he's ready to withdraw money.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mm-hmm.

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So we heard withdrawal.

150
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay.

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So withdrawal is?

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is a noun.

153
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's the action of taking money out.

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A withdrawal.

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A withdrawal.

157
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

158
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And to withdraw.

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
To withdraw is just the verb.

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
To take out money.

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Exactly.

162
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So we have the noun and the verb.

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The only difference is an L at the end.

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

165
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So withdrawal noun and withdraw verb.

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay.

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And well he wanted to withdraw money but something happened with the ATM and it turned out that he was gonna transfer money.

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Uh-oh.

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So transfer.

170
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Transfer.

171
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Transfer.

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
When you transfer money, you take it from one place and put it in another.

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And usually in banking when you transfer money you don't really see it, right?

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Exactly.

176
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's all electronic so you just put it from one bank account to another but you never actually see this money.

177
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Exactly.

178
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So transfer money.

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Transfer.

180
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And now this one also has a verb and a noun, right?

181
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right.

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
A transfer.

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And to transfer.

184
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Same word.

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yep.

186
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Easy.

187
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Alright so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the second time.

188
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's gonna be slowed down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

191
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hello.

192
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Welcome to Universal Bank.

193
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Please insert your card into the slot.

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know where to put my card.

195
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

196
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Please input your six-digit PIN code followed by the pound key.

197
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you.

198
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Please select an option.

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have selected withdraw.

201
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected.

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just give me my money.

203
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You want to transfer ten thousand US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

206
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If this is correct, please press one.

207
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No, no.

208
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Stupid machine.

209
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you doing?

210
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Confirmed.

212
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you for using our bank.

213
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please remove your card from the slot.

214
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Goodbye.

215
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No way.

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What happened?

217
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Give me my money.

218
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Danger.

219
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Danger.

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you for using our bank.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Have a nice day.

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No.

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, so that was a little easier to understand.

225
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But Marco, there's some interesting phrases here, some instructions that you commonly read or hear when you're using a bank machine.

226
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So why don't we take a look at these phrases in Fluency Builder.

227
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Fluency Builder.

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well, the bank machine told this guy to insert your card.

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Insert your card.

230
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Insert your card.

231
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So this verb, to insert, to place inside.

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Exactly.

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So what else can we insert?

234
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, for example, commonly you insert a disk.

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah, in your computer.

236
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
In your computer.

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yep.

238
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Or maybe insert a CD into your CD player.

239
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or DVD into your DVD player.

240
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yep.

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Alright, so to insert something, to put inside.

242
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

243
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So he had to insert his card into the slot.

244
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And then the bank machine asked him to select an option.

245
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Select an option.

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Select an option.

247
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now this is a very common phrase that you will not only see in ATMs but basically everywhere, right?

248
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Like in computers or the internet or many things where you're dealing with machines.

249
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So it's an order that says, well, select one of these choices that you have.

250
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Make a choice.

251
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Make a choice.

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Select an option.

254
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Alright, so two simple phrases but very useful and also very high frequency, right?

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, and you know what?

256
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When you use phrases like these two, it sounds quite professional, doesn't it?

257
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, a little bit formal.

258
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, so why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back.

259
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Stupid girl making me spend so much money.

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Now I have to get it from the ATM.

261
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hello, welcome to Universal Bank.

262
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please insert your card into the slot.

263
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I know where to put my card.

264
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Stupid machine talking to me like I'm an idiot.

265
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Please input your six digit pin code followed by the pound key.

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Thank you.

267
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Please select an option.

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you.

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You have selected withdraw.

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, yeah, I know what I selected.

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just give me my money.

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please type the amount you would like to withdraw.

273
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you.

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You want to transfer 10,000 US dollars to the World Wildlife Foundation.

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If this is correct, please press one.

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, no.

277
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Stupid machine.

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What are you doing?

279
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No.

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Confirmed.

281
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Thank you for using our bank.

282
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Please remove your card from the slot.

283
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Goodbye.

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No way.

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What happened?

286
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Give me my money.

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Danger.

288
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Danger.

289
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked until the local authorities arrive.

290
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Thank you for using our bank.

291
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Have a nice day.

292
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No.

293
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All right, Erica.

294
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So what about you?

295
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Have you ever had any problems with the ATM?

296
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I've had more problems than I can count.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What happened?

298
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, I think in the last two years I've probably lost about seven bank cards in an ATM.

299
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Really?

300
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You forget it.

301
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yes.

302
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In the slot.

303
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I leave it in the slot and then walk away from the bank machine and no bank cards.

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, I think now the ATMs, because this is a common problem, now they have like a little alarm that when you take out your money and everything, it just starts beeping and beeping until you take out your card.

305
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

306
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And I like the bank machines that actually give you your card first and then give you your money.

307
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because if they give me my money first, that's all I want, right?

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So I run away with my money and leave my card in the bank machine.

309
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Right.

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think that's a good idea.

311
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I've never seen it before, though.

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
In Switzerland, they have them like that.

313
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or what about the ATMs that you only have to swipe your card?

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh, yeah, I've done that as well and also ruined a bank card with that.

315
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I've swiped it too many times, put in the wrong PIN code and it blocks your card.

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah, terrible.

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, what about you guys?

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sure everyone has some experience or some inconvenience with ATM machines.

319
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So why don't you come to our website and tell us all about it?

320
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can also find lots more resources on our website to help you learn English.

321
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So check it out.

322
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And until next time, goodbye.
