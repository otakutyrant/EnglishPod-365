00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're bringing you another lesson on our sports series.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're talking about baseball today.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Baseball, the American national pastime.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is it?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes it is.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're going to be looking at this interesting sport that is played mainly in the Caribbean and well it's actually very popular in the United States and Japan.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Korea.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yep.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we're not only going to learn a bunch of baseball language, but we're also going to see how baseball has a big influence on English in general.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's right.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So we're going to learn a lot of great things today.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So why don't we start and listen to our dialogue.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here once again with a man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's time to play ball.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Pitcher winds up and strike one.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Very nice curve ball by the pitcher.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The catcher gives him the sign.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The outfielder throws it to second.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Vargas slides.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He's safe.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Great play.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There's the pitch.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He hits it.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's going, going.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That ball is gone.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Home run by Okami.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Ritchie Stadium.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
All right, well, a pretty exciting game there at Ritchie Stadium.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And we have some interesting players, Roger Vargas and Brian Okami.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All right, so, well, we saw some great words and, well, it's time for us to take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
OK, we're going to look at some common sports and baseball words here.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now the first phrase, we'll hear this almost at any sort of international sports event, right?

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Exactly.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And it's the national anthem.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
National anthem.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
National anthem.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So this is a song, right?

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Exactly.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's the song that you sing about your country.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And many people confuse it, right?

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, a lot of people might say national him.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
OK, him.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Because in some languages it might be like a hymn, like literally translating, but in English it's called the national anthem.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The national anthem.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All right, so what about our next word?

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, we were talking about the pitcher.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Pitcher.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
P-I-T-C-H-E-R.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The pitcher.

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Pitcher.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OK, and now this is one of the players on a baseball team and his job is to?

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To throw the ball.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To throw the ball really fast.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So that the guy can hit it with the bat.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
OK, so that's the pitcher.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now the interesting thing is that the baseball commentator said the pitcher winds up.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Wines up.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To wind up.

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
To wind up.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
OK, well let me paint you a picture.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So imagine a clock and you're turning and turning the clock to wind up, to get it ready to go.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To make it work.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Exactly.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So imagine the pitcher doing the same sort of thing, bringing his arm back behind him, getting ready to throw the ball.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
OK, so that is to wind up.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Very good.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So you can use this word not only in baseball, but for other things that require you to do this action.

84
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Right, to turn something and get it ready to have lots of power.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like some toys or maybe like a music box.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
OK, wind up.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What about our next phrase?

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, Roger Vargas hit a line drive.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Line drive.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Line drive.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
OK, so what is a line drive?

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a term from baseball.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And when you hit a line drive, you hit the ball sort of low on towards the ground and it travels along the outside of the field.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Right.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So the ball basically travels along the foul line.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That white line.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The white line.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Exactly.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Very good.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So that's a line drive.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And so the players on the field were scrambling to get the ball.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Scrambling.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Scrambling.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now, we know scrambled eggs from one of our lessons.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes, but the verb to scramble means to move quickly in a disorganized way to do something.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
OK, so the players are moving very fast trying to get the ball, but they're not doing it very well.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Right.

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And you can use this in other ways, right?

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Not just in baseball.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Right.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
For example, we can say the people are scrambling to buy their tickets for the concert.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Or I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I'm scrambling to get everything ready.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Exactly.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a very good term that you can use also in your daily life.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Exactly.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All right.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And what about our last word for today on Language Takeaway?

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, they were in the fifth inning of the game.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OK, so inning.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Inning.

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Inning.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All right.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is another baseball term and it just means the period of play.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
OK, so we learned, for example, that in soccer you have two halves.

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Or in hockey you have three periods.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And in baseball you have nine innings.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
OK, great.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So some interesting sports and baseball vocabulary.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now, I think it will help us to hear this again slower.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So let's listen to the dialogue.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Hello, baseball fans, and welcome back to today's game.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My name is Rick Fields, and of course I am here once again with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a beautiful day to see two world-class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's time to play ball.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The pitcher winds up and strike one.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A very nice curveball by the pitcher.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The catcher gives him the sign.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Vargas gets to first base, and he's still going.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The outfielder throws it to second.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Vargas slides.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's safe.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Great play.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We have a runner on third, and up at bat is Brian Okami.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's the pitch.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He hits it.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's going, going.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That ball is gone.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Home run by Okami.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That puts this team ahead by two, as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Ritchie Stadium.

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
All right, so as we said, there are a lot of English terms that come from baseball, but we use them in business context or in your daily life, right?

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why don't we look at those now in fluency builder?

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Fluency builder.

159
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All right, so the first phrase that we have is up to bat.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Up to bat.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Up to bat.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So literally, in this dialogue, it means the guy is standing on home plate ready to hit the ball, right?

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He has the bat, and he's ready to hit it.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But what about in other contexts?

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So for example, you can be at a meeting, and maybe it's your turn to talk.

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So you're up to bat.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So exactly.

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Your boss will say, OK, Erika, you're up to bat.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
OK, so it means sort of like it's your turn.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's your turn.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, very good.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right, so that's another term that is used in baseball, but very commonly used in other circumstances.

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So we also saw in the dialogue that Roger Vegas, he hit the ball, but he missed.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And that was strike one.

175
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right, strike one.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So in baseball, you have three strikes.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Three tries.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Three tries before you're out.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And so now the same thing happens in daily life.

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So if someone says, that was strike one, it means you made the first mistake.

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes.

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And if you make two more, you will be fired, for example.

184
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Or maybe your parents will say, OK, that wasn't nice.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Strike one.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And then two more times and you'll have a timeout.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Or you'll be grounded.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
OK, so that's also called a strike.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And the pitcher threw a curve ball.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
A curve ball.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Curve ball.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So, OK, pretty clear, a curve ball is when you throw the ball and it sort of goes in a curve.

194
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It doesn't go straight.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Exactly.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But how can this be used outside of baseball?

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you can say, oh, my boss threw me a curve ball today.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So he gave you an unexpected problem.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Uh huh.

201
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Or something that was difficult to handle.

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
OK.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This one is pretty interesting.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'd like to hear a few more examples.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Example one.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My boss threw me a curve ball today, so I have to stay and work late.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Example two.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It was a huge curve ball when she asked me how many kids I wanted to have.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How am I supposed to know?

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right, so that's basically a curve ball.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You can say an unexpected problem or situation.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's right.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And our last phrase, and we'll probably one that you already know, home run.

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
A home run.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A home run.

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
From baseball, we know that that's when you hit the ball really far.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And you hit it outside of the playing area or outside the park.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yes.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And now if you use it in a business context or in your daily life.

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It means something similar.

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why don't we take a listen to the examples and see if we can figure it out.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Example one.

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Great job on that sales presentation.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You really hit a home run.

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Example two.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Our sales team hit a home run this month by doubling our revenue.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay, so basically a home run is a success.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A victory.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A victory.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, something, a big accomplishment.

231
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's right.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So we've seen a lot of these great phrases and as you can see, a lot of them from baseball are used in your daily life and there are many, many more.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, well, why don't we hear them again in the baseball context and we'll listen to the dialogue one more time.

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here once again with a man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's time to play ball.

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Pitcher winds up and strike one.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Very nice curve ball by the pitcher.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The catcher gives him the sign.

243
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

246
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The outfielder throws it to second.

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Vargas slides.

248
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He's safe.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Great play.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami.

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's the pitch.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He hits it.

253
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's going, going.

254
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That ball is gone.

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Home run by Okami.

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Ritchie Stadium.

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
All right, so an interesting dialogue, a very interesting sport.

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And well, personally, I never played this as a child.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Me neither, really.

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't really like it too much, but it is kind of fun to go to a game.

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And especially in the United States, have those hot dogs and all that.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
OK, yeah, well, a cultural event, a really important piece of American culture.

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Exactly.

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
