00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,540
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:05,960
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:09,560
And today we're bringing you another lesson on our sports series.

6
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,460
We're talking about baseball today.

7
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:15,199
Baseball, the American national pastime.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,759
Is it?

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,539
Yes it is.

10
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,079
Okay.

11
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:26,019
So we're going to be looking at this interesting sport that is played mainly in the Caribbean and well it's actually very popular in the United States and Japan.

12
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,679
That's right.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,100
Korea.

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,579
Yep.

15
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:37,479
So we're not only going to learn a bunch of baseball language, but we're also going to see how baseball has a big influence on English in general.

16
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:37,979
That's right.

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,119
So we're going to learn a lot of great things today.

18
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,880
So why don't we start and listen to our dialogue.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,939
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game.

20
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,759
My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here once again with a man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

21
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:08,680
It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,879
Well, the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,099
It's time to play ball.

24
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:17,560
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

25
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,200
Pitcher winds up and strike one.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,019
Very nice curve ball by the pitcher.

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,620
The catcher gives him the sign.

28
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:28,060
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,859
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,959
Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

31
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,980
The outfielder throws it to second.

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,400
Vargas slides.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,420
He's safe.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,560
Great play.

35
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,659
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami.

36
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,980
There's the pitch.

37
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:46,319
He hits it.

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,560
It's going, going.

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,540
That ball is gone.

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
Home run by Okami.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,099
That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Ritchie Stadium.

42
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,980
All right, well, a pretty exciting game there at Ritchie Stadium.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:07,900
Exactly.

44
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,199
And we have some interesting players, Roger Vargas and Brian Okami.

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,819
All right, so, well, we saw some great words and, well, it's time for us to take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:23,139
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,599
OK, we're going to look at some common sports and baseball words here.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,960
Now the first phrase, we'll hear this almost at any sort of international sports event, right?

49
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,039
Exactly.

50
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,759
And it's the national anthem.

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,879
National anthem.

52
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,500
National anthem.

53
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:43,240
So this is a song, right?

54
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:43,780
Exactly.

55
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,139
It's the song that you sing about your country.

56
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:48,120
And many people confuse it, right?

57
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,819
Yeah, a lot of people might say national him.

58
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:51,860
OK, him.

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:59,979
Because in some languages it might be like a hymn, like literally translating, but in English it's called the national anthem.

60
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,979
The national anthem.

61
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,259
All right, so what about our next word?

62
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,800
Well, we were talking about the pitcher.

63
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,300
Pitcher.

64
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:10,280
P-I-T-C-H-E-R.

65
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,159
The pitcher.

66
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:11,680
Pitcher.

67
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,120
OK, and now this is one of the players on a baseball team and his job is to?

68
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,120
To throw the ball.

69
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,659
To throw the ball really fast.

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,699
So that the guy can hit it with the bat.

71
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:24,419
OK, so that's the pitcher.

72
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,620
Now the interesting thing is that the baseball commentator said the pitcher winds up.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,900
Wines up.

74
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,439
To wind up.

75
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,280
To wind up.

76
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,419
OK, well let me paint you a picture.

77
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:46,020
So imagine a clock and you're turning and turning the clock to wind up, to get it ready to go.

78
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,020
To make it work.

79
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:47,719
Exactly.

80
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,199
So imagine the pitcher doing the same sort of thing, bringing his arm back behind him, getting ready to throw the ball.

81
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,400
OK, so that is to wind up.

82
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,620
Very good.

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,000
So you can use this word not only in baseball, but for other things that require you to do this action.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,159
Right, to turn something and get it ready to have lots of power.

85
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:10,520
Like some toys or maybe like a music box.

86
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,620
OK, wind up.

87
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,340
What about our next phrase?

88
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,779
Well, Roger Vargas hit a line drive.

89
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,220
Line drive.

90
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,259
Line drive.

91
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,000
OK, so what is a line drive?

92
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:24,500
It's a term from baseball.

93
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:33,379
And when you hit a line drive, you hit the ball sort of low on towards the ground and it travels along the outside of the field.

94
00:04:33,459 --> 00:04:33,779
Right.

95
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,339
So the ball basically travels along the foul line.

96
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,480
That white line.

97
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,139
The white line.

98
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:38,500
Exactly.

99
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,620
Very good.

100
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,360
So that's a line drive.

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,459
And so the players on the field were scrambling to get the ball.

102
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,319
Scrambling.

103
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,199
Scrambling.

104
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,339
Now, we know scrambled eggs from one of our lessons.

105
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:59,139
Yes, but the verb to scramble means to move quickly in a disorganized way to do something.

106
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,720
OK, so the players are moving very fast trying to get the ball, but they're not doing it very well.

107
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,300
Right.

108
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,259
And you can use this in other ways, right?

109
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,139
Not just in baseball.

110
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:08,839
Right.

111
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:13,740
For example, we can say the people are scrambling to buy their tickets for the concert.

112
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,120
Yeah.

113
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,759
Or I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I'm scrambling to get everything ready.

114
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:19,420
Exactly.

115
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,399
It's a very good term that you can use also in your daily life.

116
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:22,920
Exactly.

117
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:23,740
All right.

118
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,920
And what about our last word for today on Language Takeaway?

119
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,579
Well, they were in the fifth inning of the game.

120
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,160
OK, so inning.

121
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:32,860
Inning.

122
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:33,639
Inning.

123
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:34,480
All right.

124
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,300
This is another baseball term and it just means the period of play.

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,060
OK, so we learned, for example, that in soccer you have two halves.

126
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,660
Or in hockey you have three periods.

127
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:49,220
All right.

128
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:51,339
And in baseball you have nine innings.

129
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:52,420
OK, great.

130
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,100
So some interesting sports and baseball vocabulary.

131
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,220
Now, I think it will help us to hear this again slower.

132
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,439
So let's listen to the dialogue.

133
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,519
Hello, baseball fans, and welcome back to today's game.

134
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:21,620
My name is Rick Fields, and of course I am here once again with the man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

135
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:27,920
It's a beautiful day to see two world-class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

136
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,480
Well, the national anthem has just been sung, and the umpire has started the game.

137
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,180
It's time to play ball.

138
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,860
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

139
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:43,279
The pitcher winds up and strike one.

140
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,439
A very nice curveball by the pitcher.

141
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,920
The catcher gives him the sign.

142
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,740
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

143
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,620
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

144
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,439
Vargas gets to first base, and he's still going.

145
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,420
The outfielder throws it to second.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,839
Vargas slides.

147
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:03,860
He's safe.

148
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,100
Great play.

149
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,199
We have a runner on third, and up at bat is Brian Okami.

150
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:10,420
There's the pitch.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,639
He hits it.

152
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,139
It's going, going.

153
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,060
That ball is gone.

154
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,120
Home run by Okami.

155
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,500
That puts this team ahead by two, as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Ritchie Stadium.

156
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:38,279
All right, so as we said, there are a lot of English terms that come from baseball, but we use them in business context or in your daily life, right?

157
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,759
Why don't we look at those now in fluency builder?

158
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,639
Fluency builder.

159
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,639
All right, so the first phrase that we have is up to bat.

160
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:49,540
Up to bat.

161
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,259
Up to bat.

162
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,139
So literally, in this dialogue, it means the guy is standing on home plate ready to hit the ball, right?

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,259
He has the bat, and he's ready to hit it.

164
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,540
But what about in other contexts?

165
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,360
So for example, you can be at a meeting, and maybe it's your turn to talk.

166
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,540
So you're up to bat.

167
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,680
So exactly.

168
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
Your boss will say, OK, Erika, you're up to bat.

169
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,160
OK, so it means sort of like it's your turn.

170
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:14,800
It's your turn.

171
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,579
Yeah, very good.

172
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:21,620
All right, so that's another term that is used in baseball, but very commonly used in other circumstances.

173
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:28,439
So we also saw in the dialogue that Roger Vegas, he hit the ball, but he missed.

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,600
And that was strike one.

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,539
Right, strike one.

176
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,059
So in baseball, you have three strikes.

177
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,840
Three tries.

178
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,279
Three tries before you're out.

179
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:37,759
Yes.

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,580
And so now the same thing happens in daily life.

181
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,279
So if someone says, that was strike one, it means you made the first mistake.

182
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:48,620
Yes.

183
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,220
And if you make two more, you will be fired, for example.

184
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,159
Or maybe your parents will say, OK, that wasn't nice.

185
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,120
Strike one.

186
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,720
And then two more times and you'll have a timeout.

187
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,779
Or you'll be grounded.

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,159
Yes.

189
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,840
OK, so that's also called a strike.

190
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,620
And the pitcher threw a curve ball.

191
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,740
A curve ball.

192
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,480
Curve ball.

193
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,679
So, OK, pretty clear, a curve ball is when you throw the ball and it sort of goes in a curve.

194
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,539
It doesn't go straight.

195
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:14,960
Right.

196
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,539
Exactly.

197
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,379
But how can this be used outside of baseball?

198
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:22,059
So you can say, oh, my boss threw me a curve ball today.

199
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,559
So he gave you an unexpected problem.

200
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,120
Uh huh.

201
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,580
Or something that was difficult to handle.

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,200
OK.

203
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,080
This one is pretty interesting.

204
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:31,860
I'd like to hear a few more examples.

205
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:34,740
Example one.

206
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,019
My boss threw me a curve ball today, so I have to stay and work late.

207
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:46,500
Example two.

208
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,460
It was a huge curve ball when she asked me how many kids I wanted to have.

209
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,019
How am I supposed to know?

210
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,960
All right, so that's basically a curve ball.

211
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,259
You can say an unexpected problem or situation.

212
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:03,779
That's right.

213
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:08,679
And our last phrase, and we'll probably one that you already know, home run.

214
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,500
A home run.

215
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,399
A home run.

216
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,659
From baseball, we know that that's when you hit the ball really far.

217
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:17,159
And you hit it outside of the playing area or outside the park.

218
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:17,519
Yes.

219
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,980
And now if you use it in a business context or in your daily life.

220
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,720
It means something similar.

221
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:27,740
Why don't we take a listen to the examples and see if we can figure it out.

222
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,399
Example one.

223
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,700
Great job on that sales presentation.

224
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,519
You really hit a home run.

225
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:40,500
Example two.

226
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,340
Our sales team hit a home run this month by doubling our revenue.

227
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,059
Okay, so basically a home run is a success.

228
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:52,899
A victory.

229
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,580
A victory.

230
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,500
Yeah, something, a big accomplishment.

231
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,340
That's right.

232
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:03,779
So we've seen a lot of these great phrases and as you can see, a lot of them from baseball are used in your daily life and there are many, many more.

233
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,519
Okay, well, why don't we hear them again in the baseball context and we'll listen to the dialogue one more time.

234
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,179
Hello baseball fans and welcome back to today's game.

235
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,039
My name is Rick Fields and of course I am here once again with a man that seals the deal, Bob Copeland.

236
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,980
It's a beautiful day to see two world class teams face each other and fight for their right to be called champions.

237
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,139
Well, the national anthem has just been sung and the umpire has started the game.

238
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,340
It's time to play ball.

239
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,840
Roger Vargas is up at bat.

240
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,460
Pitcher winds up and strike one.

241
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,279
Very nice curve ball by the pitcher.

242
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,879
The catcher gives him the sign.

243
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,299
He winds up and Vargas gets a line drive.

244
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,139
The players are scrambling to get the ball.

245
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
Vargas gets to first base and he's still going.

246
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,240
The outfielder throws it to second.

247
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,639
Vargas slides.

248
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:03,700
He's safe.

249
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:04,799
Great play.

250
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,899
We have a runner on third and up at bat is Brian Okami.

251
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,240
There's the pitch.

252
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:11,379
He hits it.

253
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,820
It's going, going.

254
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,799
That ball is gone.

255
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,740
Home run by Okami.

256
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:22,320
That puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at Ritchie Stadium.

257
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:30,539
All right, so an interesting dialogue, a very interesting sport.

258
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,120
And well, personally, I never played this as a child.

259
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,460
Me neither, really.

260
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,659
I don't really like it too much, but it is kind of fun to go to a game.

261
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,820
And especially in the United States, have those hot dogs and all that.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,899
OK, yeah, well, a cultural event, a really important piece of American culture.

263
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,600
Exactly.

264
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,779
