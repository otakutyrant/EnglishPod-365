00:00:01,799 --> 00:00:02,980
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:04,519
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,080
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,320
And today we're bringing you the next part of our suspense series, The New Guy in Town.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,160
That's right.

7
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,039
So we know that Armada wasn't really a vampire, that he was just acting.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,719
And the women aren't quite what they seem in this dialogue.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,820
In the last one, something happened and she transformed into some sort of, I don't know, creature, right?

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,440
Like monster!

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,379
Right, so now let's see what happens.

12
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,859
So we're not going to preview any vocabulary this time.

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,340
Let's just listen to the dialogue and see what happens.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,719
Howdy ma'am.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,239
What seems to be the problem?

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
Is this man bothering you?

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,480
Officer, officer, there is like a witch creature back there.

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,879
We tied her up but she broke free and she was about to have us for dinner.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,099
Okay, calm down, calm down.

20
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:23,500
Let me see your eyes, please.

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,799
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,560
We're telling the truth.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,540
She's in there.

24
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,239
We suspected her being a kidnapper or a rapist but turns out she's an alien or something.

25
00:01:36,819 --> 00:01:39,640
Okay, calm down, calm down.

26
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,659
Let me see your eyes, please.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,379
Ugh, seriously.

28
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,340
Are you going to help us out or not?

29
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,879
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

30
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,680
Hello?

31
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,740
Is anyone in there?

32
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,800
Be careful, she might be hiding.

33
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,120
It's perfectly safe.

34
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,740
There isn't anyone.

35
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:06,860
Well, I don't think things are turning out very well for our housewives and our mons.

36
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:12,360
Apparently the police officer is not going to make it to the next episode.

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:23,120
All right, so we saw some really great vocabulary and even though it's kind of a scary story, there is a lot of things we can learn so why don't we take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

38
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,960
Language Takeaway.

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,539
All right, so what exactly is a creature?

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,219
Well, a creature can be any animal.

41
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,000
Any animal?

42
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,439
Yeah, like from a mouse to a bird to an insect or a bug.

43
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,599
So I can say a bird is a flying creature.

44
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,139
Exactly.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,719
All right.

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,060
But sometimes we also use it to mean an unknown and scary animal.

47
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,560
So there's a creature under my bed.

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
Yes, or some type of creature was attacking me.

49
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:07,960
Okay, so a creature can be any sort of living thing.

50
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,400
Exactly.

51
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:08,840
Or animal.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,199
Yep.

53
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,039
All right, what about our next one?

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,900
Well, the creature broke free from some ropes.

55
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,019
All right, so to break free.

56
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,040
Break free?

57
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:17,639
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,819
And what does that mean?

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,379
When you break free, you escape from something that stops you moving.

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,040
Okay, so you have the ability to move again.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,079
Yes, you break free from maybe ropes or chains or even a relationship.

62
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,699
Okay, so I can say, oh, I finally broke free from that awful relationship.

63
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:37,379
Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,420
Now that's quite interesting the way we can use this in different ways.

65
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,319
So why don't we take a look at some examples now.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Example 1.

67
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,399
We tied up the dog, but he is trying to break free.

68
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,540
Example 2.

69
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,839
I'm glad that I broke free from that horrible relationship.

70
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,939
Example 3.

71
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,879
I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities.

72
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,699
Okay, so break free.

73
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,480
It's clear now.

74
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:19,100
Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,899
So why don't we move on to our next word.

76
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,939
They thought that maybe this creature was a kidnapper.

77
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,060
Kidnapper?

78
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:26,699
Kidnapper.

79
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,959
Okay, so this is a criminal.

80
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,439
So a kidnapper is a criminal.

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:30,860
Yep.

82
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,500
All right, and what exactly does a kidnapper do?

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,459
A kidnapper takes someone to a place and keeps them there against their will.

84
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:40,279
Against their will.

85
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,399
With force or violence.

86
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,939
All right, so I guess that makes sense, right?

87
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,699
Because the word has kid in it.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:45,959
Yeah.

89
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,639
So to take children.

90
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

91
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,519
But it can be also you can kidnap an adult.

92
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:51,379
Yes, that's true.

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:51,939
All right.

94
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,000
So this word can actually be used in three different ways.

95
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,259
So we saw a kidnapper, right?

96
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:58,480
Okay, that is the person.

97
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,879
Yeah, and the verb to kidnap.

98
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:01,920
Okay.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,079
Or a noun describing an action.

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,199
A kidnapping.

101
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:06,180
A kidnapping.

102
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:06,779
Very good.

103
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,480
Yeah, a kidnapping took place today.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,160
Okay, so very interesting word and of course it's illegal to be a kidnapper.

105
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:14,540
Yes.

106
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,019
So our next word is also very serious and it's also a crime.

107
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,759
That's right.

108
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:19,899
A rapist.

109
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:20,839
A rapist.

110
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:21,560
A rapist.

111
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,379
Okay, so that is a person that who forces someone to have sex.

112
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,819
Okay, so again, against their will.

113
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,279
Right.

114
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:29,959
Like a kidnapper.

115
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,540
Exactly.

116
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,600
Okay, and the verb would be to rape.

117
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,180
To rape.

118
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,839
To rape someone.

119
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,319
Okay, so on the lighter side, we heard the police officer say something in a very strange way.

120
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,160
He is an interesting phrase.

121
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,459
It's a sound made from pushing two words together, right?

122
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:58,819
So let me why don't we hear a few more examples of this and see if we can figure out what are the two words.

123
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,800
Example one.

124
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,560
Let me have a look inside the car.

125
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,100
Example two.

126
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
Let me go out tonight, please.

127
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,800
Example three.

128
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,420
Let me think about it and I will give you an answer tomorrow.

129
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,360
So basically, let me is let me let me Yeah, let me have that pen.

130
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,259
Okay, let me see.

131
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:35,879
Mm hmm.

132
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:38,279
Now, we do this also with other words, right?

133
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:38,660
Yeah.

134
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,519
Another example would be gimme gimme.

135
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:41,759
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,920
So that is give me exactly.

137
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:44,680
Okay.

138
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,500
So an interesting thing.

139
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,939
It's not proper English, right?

140
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:51,439
No, you wouldn't really write it this way, but find it in the dictionary.

141
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,060
But it's really common when people speak.

142
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:59,600
And actually, it's more likely that you'll say lemme gimme then let me give me.

143
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,920
Okay, very good.

144
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,040
So I think now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

145
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,920
And what the heck is going on?

146
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,220
Did you see that?

147
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,000
What was that thing?

148
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,360
I don't know.

149
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,980
I'm just glad we made it out.

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,199
Look, there's a police car.

151
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,579
Help, help.

152
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,939
Please stop.

153
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,620
Howdy, ma'am.

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,820
What seems to be the problem?

155
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,799
Is this man bothering you?

156
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:37,700
Officer?

157
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,100
Officer?

158
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,679
There is like a witch creature back there.

159
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,620
We tied her up, but she broke free.

160
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:48,299
And she was about to have us for dinner.

161
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,720
Okay, calm down.

162
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:51,620
Calm down.

163
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,759
Let me see your eyes, please.

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,159
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

165
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:58,139
We are telling the truth.

166
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,879
She's in there.

167
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:09,159
We suspected her of being a kidnapper or rapist, but it turns out she's an alien or something.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,440
Okay, calm down.

169
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,340
Calm down.

170
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,700
Let me see your eyes, please.

171
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,059
Oh, seriously.

172
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,840
Are you gonna help us or not?

173
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,539
Okay, let's go have a look.

174
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,320
Shall we?

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,399
Hello?

176
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:26,440
Is anyone in here?

177
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,899
Be careful.

178
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,019
She might be hiding.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,299
It's perfectly safe.

180
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,539
There isn't anyone.

181
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,220
We're gonna look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder that you might hear when you're talking about a crime.

182
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,220
Fluency Builder.

183
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,669
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is what the is going on?

184
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,990
What the heck is going on?

185
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,470
What the heck is going on?

186
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,289
Okay, so this is just asking what's happening, right?

187
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,429
Right, but it's a very strong way of saying what's happening.

188
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,230
Yeah, what really is happening?

189
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:02,870
Uh huh.

190
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:04,889
Now, why did they say what the heck?

191
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:05,889
What is heck?

192
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,110
Well, heck is sort of a polite way of saying hell.

193
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,769
Okay, so instead of saying what the hell is going on?

194
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:12,929
What the heck is going on?

195
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,870
Why do you do this?

196
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:20,250
Because in especially in American English, we don't like to talk about religious words.

197
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:26,210
So like hell and God and Jesus, these things are impolite in American English.

198
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:27,309
Right, you don't want to offend anyone.

199
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,090
Right, so that's why we would have other words like oh my gosh.

200
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:32,169
For oh my God.

201
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,909
Or jeez.

202
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:34,990
Instead of Jesus.

203
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:45,370
Right, okay, so that is an interesting thing and of course it's it is a little bit of a sensitive topic among some people, so that's why it's better to just use these synonyms.

204
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:45,809
Yes.

205
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,590
Okay, and what about our next phrase?

206
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,789
So they suspected her of being a kidnapper.

207
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,730
Okay, so suspected her of being a kidnapper.

208
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,789
Yeah, suspect someone of being something something.

209
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,750
So I suspect she is an alien.

210
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,509
Right, I suspect him being a liar.

211
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,710
Okay, so what about to suspect?

212
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:10,889
What does that mean exactly?

213
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,850
To think something that is true, but not be 100% sure.

214
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,529
So you can say I think she is a kidnapper.

215
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:18,870
Yep.

216
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,970
Oh, I suspect her of being a kidnapper.

217
00:11:22,669 --> 00:11:22,870
Interesting.

218
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:24,690
Why don't we hear a few more examples?

219
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,009
Example one.

220
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,970
The police suspected him of being a bank robber.

221
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,929
Example two.

222
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,529
We suspect our dog is responsible for this mess.

223
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,110
Example three.

224
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,909
The neighborhood suspected that our neighbor was selling drugs.

225
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:56,970
All right, very good.

226
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,509
So we've seen a lot of vocab.

227
00:11:58,649 --> 00:11:59,769
We've seen these phrases.

228
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:05,789
So I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

229
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:14,450
What the heck is going on?

230
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,409
Did you see that?

231
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,350
What was that thing?

232
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,129
I don't know.

233
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,570
I'm just glad we made it out.

234
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,070
Look, there's a police car.

235
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,009
Help!

236
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:22,870
Help!

237
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:23,230
Please!

238
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,070
Please stop!

239
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,590
Howdy, ma'am.

240
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,110
What seems to be the problem?

241
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,090
Is this man bothering you?

242
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:41,350
Officer, officer, there is like a witch creature back there.

243
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,750
We tied her up, but she broke free, and she was about to have us for dinner.

244
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,049
Okay, calm down.

245
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:47,950
Calm down.

246
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,350
Let me see your eyes, please.

247
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,669
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

248
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,450
We're telling the truth.

249
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,409
She's in there.

250
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:03,110
We suspected her of being a kidnapper or a rapist, but turns out she's an alien or something.

251
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,649
Okay, calm down.

252
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,509
Calm down.

253
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,570
Let me see your eyes, please.

254
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:12,269
Seriously, are you gonna help us out or not?

255
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,809
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

256
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,570
Hello?

257
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:43,629
Is anyone in there?

258
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:46,309
Be careful.

259
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:47,769
She might be hiding.

260
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,990
It's perfectly safe.

261
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,090
There isn't anyone.

262
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:34,830
Okay, well, Marco, we're coming near the end of this series, aren't we?

263
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:35,789
Yes, exactly.

264
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:40,850
It's a short series, but what do you think happens or how do you think the series ends?

265
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,750
What is really going on?

266
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:44,830
A mystery here at EnglishPod.
