00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're bringing you the next part of our suspense series, The New Guy in Town.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we know that Armada wasn't really a vampire, that he was just acting.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And the women aren't quite what they seem in this dialogue.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In the last one, something happened and she transformed into some sort of, I don't know, creature, right?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Like monster!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right, so now let's see what happens.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we're not going to preview any vocabulary this time.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's just listen to the dialogue and see what happens.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Howdy ma'am.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What seems to be the problem?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is this man bothering you?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Officer, officer, there is like a witch creature back there.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We tied her up but she broke free and she was about to have us for dinner.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, calm down, calm down.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let me see your eyes, please.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're telling the truth.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She's in there.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We suspected her being a kidnapper or a rapist but turns out she's an alien or something.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, calm down, calm down.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let me see your eyes, please.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Ugh, seriously.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you going to help us out or not?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is anyone in there?

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Be careful, she might be hiding.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's perfectly safe.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There isn't anyone.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, I don't think things are turning out very well for our housewives and our mons.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Apparently the police officer is not going to make it to the next episode.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
All right, so we saw some really great vocabulary and even though it's kind of a scary story, there is a lot of things we can learn so why don't we take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Language Takeaway.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right, so what exactly is a creature?

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, a creature can be any animal.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Any animal?

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, like from a mouse to a bird to an insect or a bug.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I can say a bird is a flying creature.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Exactly.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All right.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But sometimes we also use it to mean an unknown and scary animal.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So there's a creature under my bed.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, or some type of creature was attacking me.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, so a creature can be any sort of living thing.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Exactly.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Or animal.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yep.

53
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
All right, what about our next one?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, the creature broke free from some ropes.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right, so to break free.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Break free?

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And what does that mean?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
When you break free, you escape from something that stops you moving.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay, so you have the ability to move again.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, you break free from maybe ropes or chains or even a relationship.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay, so I can say, oh, I finally broke free from that awful relationship.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now that's quite interesting the way we can use this in different ways.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So why don't we take a look at some examples now.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Example 1.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We tied up the dog, but he is trying to break free.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Example 2.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm glad that I broke free from that horrible relationship.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Example 3.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I want to break free from all my daily responsibilities.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, so break free.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's clear now.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mm-hmm.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So why don't we move on to our next word.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They thought that maybe this creature was a kidnapper.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Kidnapper?

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Kidnapper.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so this is a criminal.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So a kidnapper is a criminal.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yep.

82
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
All right, and what exactly does a kidnapper do?

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A kidnapper takes someone to a place and keeps them there against their will.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Against their will.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
With force or violence.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right, so I guess that makes sense, right?

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because the word has kid in it.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah.

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So to take children.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But it can be also you can kidnap an adult.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, that's true.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
All right.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So this word can actually be used in three different ways.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So we saw a kidnapper, right?

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, that is the person.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, and the verb to kidnap.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or a noun describing an action.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A kidnapping.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
A kidnapping.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Very good.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, a kidnapping took place today.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, so very interesting word and of course it's illegal to be a kidnapper.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So our next word is also very serious and it's also a crime.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
A rapist.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
A rapist.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A rapist.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, so that is a person that who forces someone to have sex.

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, so again, against their will.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Right.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Like a kidnapper.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Exactly.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, and the verb would be to rape.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
To rape.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
To rape someone.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, so on the lighter side, we heard the police officer say something in a very strange way.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He is an interesting phrase.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a sound made from pushing two words together, right?

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So let me why don't we hear a few more examples of this and see if we can figure out what are the two words.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Example one.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let me have a look inside the car.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Example two.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let me go out tonight, please.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Example three.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let me think about it and I will give you an answer tomorrow.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So basically, let me is let me let me Yeah, let me have that pen.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay, let me see.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Mm hmm.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now, we do this also with other words, right?

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Another example would be gimme gimme.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yeah.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So that is give me exactly.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So an interesting thing.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not proper English, right?

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, you wouldn't really write it this way, but find it in the dictionary.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But it's really common when people speak.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And actually, it's more likely that you'll say lemme gimme then let me give me.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, very good.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So I think now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the second time.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And what the heck is going on?

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Did you see that?

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What was that thing?

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm just glad we made it out.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Look, there's a police car.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Help, help.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Please stop.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Howdy, ma'am.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What seems to be the problem?

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is this man bothering you?

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Officer?

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Officer?

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There is like a witch creature back there.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We tied her up, but she broke free.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And she was about to have us for dinner.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, calm down.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Calm down.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let me see your eyes, please.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We are telling the truth.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
She's in there.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
We suspected her of being a kidnapper or rapist, but it turns out she's an alien or something.

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, calm down.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Calm down.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let me see your eyes, please.

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, seriously.

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you gonna help us or not?

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay, let's go have a look.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Shall we?

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hello?

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is anyone in here?

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Be careful.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
She might be hiding.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's perfectly safe.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There isn't anyone.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We're gonna look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder that you might hear when you're talking about a crime.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Fluency Builder.

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is what the is going on?

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What the heck is going on?

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What the heck is going on?

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay, so this is just asking what's happening, right?

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Right, but it's a very strong way of saying what's happening.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, what really is happening?

189
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Uh huh.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Now, why did they say what the heck?

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What is heck?

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, heck is sort of a polite way of saying hell.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay, so instead of saying what the hell is going on?

194
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What the heck is going on?

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why do you do this?

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Because in especially in American English, we don't like to talk about religious words.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So like hell and God and Jesus, these things are impolite in American English.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Right, you don't want to offend anyone.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right, so that's why we would have other words like oh my gosh.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
For oh my God.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Or jeez.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Instead of Jesus.

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Right, okay, so that is an interesting thing and of course it's it is a little bit of a sensitive topic among some people, so that's why it's better to just use these synonyms.

204
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yes.

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, and what about our next phrase?

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So they suspected her of being a kidnapper.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, so suspected her of being a kidnapper.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, suspect someone of being something something.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So I suspect she is an alien.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Right, I suspect him being a liar.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, so what about to suspect?

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What does that mean exactly?

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
To think something that is true, but not be 100% sure.

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So you can say I think she is a kidnapper.

215
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yep.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, I suspect her of being a kidnapper.

217
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Interesting.

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why don't we hear a few more examples?

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Example one.

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The police suspected him of being a bank robber.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Example two.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We suspect our dog is responsible for this mess.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Example three.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The neighborhood suspected that our neighbor was selling drugs.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All right, very good.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So we've seen a lot of vocab.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We've seen these phrases.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What the heck is going on?

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Did you see that?

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What was that thing?

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm just glad we made it out.

234
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Look, there's a police car.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Help!

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Help!

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Please!

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Please stop!

239
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Howdy, ma'am.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What seems to be the problem?

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is this man bothering you?

242
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Officer, officer, there is like a witch creature back there.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We tied her up, but she broke free, and she was about to have us for dinner.

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, calm down.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Calm down.

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let me see your eyes, please.

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Have you been drinking tonight, son?

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
We're telling the truth.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
She's in there.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We suspected her of being a kidnapper or a rapist, but turns out she's an alien or something.

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, calm down.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Calm down.

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let me see your eyes, please.

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Seriously, are you gonna help us out or not?

255
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Okay, let's go have a look, shall we?

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hello?

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is anyone in there?

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Be careful.

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
She might be hiding.

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's perfectly safe.

261
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There isn't anyone.

262
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay, well, Marco, we're coming near the end of this series, aren't we?

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, exactly.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a short series, but what do you think happens or how do you think the series ends?

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is really going on?

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
A mystery here at EnglishPod.
