00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com Hey, you're early.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Where is everyone?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, I told them not to come.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh, why?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sure, what is it?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay, here's the thing.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it anymore.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I know you better than anyone.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think we would be great together, don't you?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you serious?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We've been friends for years.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We can't just change that overnight.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I know.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I never had the guts to tell you.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Until today.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So what do you say?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ah.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ah.
