EnglishPod.com Hey, you're early.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,619
Where is everyone?

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:14,619
Well, I told them not to come.

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,780
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,160
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,719
Oh, why?

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,940
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

8
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:26,420
Sure, what is it?

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,399
Okay, here's the thing.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,740
I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it anymore.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,600
I know you better than anyone.

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,859
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

13
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:39,179
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,740
I think we would be great together, don't you?

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,479
Are you serious?

16
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,200
We've been friends for years.

17
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,119
We can't just change that overnight.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,859
I know.

19
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,780
I never had the guts to tell you.

20
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:51,920
Until today.

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,539
So what do you say?

22
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,060
Are you willing to give me a shot?

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,719
Ah.

24
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:56,880
Ah.
