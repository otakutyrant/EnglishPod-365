00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:02,899
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,240
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:04,960
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:05,879
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,240
And today we're looking at some more romance.

6
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,759
We're talking about dating.

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,160
Dating, exactly.

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,820
And not only dating, but asking someone to become your boyfriend or girlfriend.

9
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,780
Yep, that's true.

10
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:23,600
And so we're going to be focusing on language to express your romantic feelings.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,359
And also maybe some phrases you can use to ask someone out.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,179
Very good.

13
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,320
So I'm sure you guys are excited about this one.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,079
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,640
Hey, you're early.

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:44,840
Where's everyone?

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,859
Well, I told them not to come.

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,020
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,399
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,939
Oh, why?

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,200
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

22
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:57,820
Sure.

23
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:58,640
What is it?

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,619
Okay, here's the thing.

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,280
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,959
And I can't take it anymore.

27
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,819
I know you better than anyone.

28
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,079
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,420
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

30
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,959
I think we would be great together, don't you?

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,739
Are you serious?

32
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,480
We've been friends for years.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
We can't just change that overnight.

34
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,099
I know.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
I never had the guts to tell you until today.

36
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,780
So what do you say?

37
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,299
Are you willing to give me a shot?

38
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,099
All right, I wonder, is she going to say yes?

39
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,019
I don't know.

40
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,579
She seems a little bit confused.

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,319
Well, I guess it's always strange when your best friend suddenly wants to be your boyfriend or girlfriend.

42
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,799
It does happen though.

43
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,719
It does happen.

44
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,819
So why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this dialogue to express these feelings.

45
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:53,920
And let's start with fluency builder.

46
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,040
Fluency builder.

47
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,340
Okay, so we're doing things a little differently today.

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
We're looking at phrases and not just vocabulary words.

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,460
So he used some wonderful phrases to ask her to be his boyfriend.

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,379
And he started with this.

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,159
Here's the thing.

52
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,800
Here's the thing.

53
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,500
All right, that's a very strange phrase.

54
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,419
Here's the thing.

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,539
Is he giving her something?

56
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,379
Not quite.

57
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,340
He's not giving her an object, but he's giving her some information.

58
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,479
Okay, so it's a very common way to start an idea.

59
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,020
That's right.

60
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:35,280
You're about to tell the person the main problem or the main piece of information.

61
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,780
Right, so you would start with here's the thing and then start explaining.

62
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:39,819
Okay, why don't we do an example?

63
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:42,740
For example, you could say, all right, here's the thing.

64
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,419
People don't like you.

65
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,060
All right.

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,560
Well, I hope they don't say that to me.

67
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,780
But another example.

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,979
Marco, here's the thing.

69
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,080
We're behind in our podcasting.

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
We have to work overtime.

71
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,939
Okay, so the main idea.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,240
Yep.

73
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,139
Very good.

74
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,099
Moving on to our next phrase.

75
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,080
He said, I can't take it.

76
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,520
I can't take it anymore.

77
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,840
I can't take it anymore.

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,960
So he can't take it anymore.

79
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,659
Take what?

80
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,120
Well, why don't we find out by listening to some examples?

81
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Example one.

82
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,740
The man next door has been so loud.

83
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,219
I can't take it anymore.

84
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,719
Example two.

85
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,580
My boss always yells at me.

86
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:30,900
I can't take it anymore.

87
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,259
Example three.

88
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't take it anymore.

89
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:40,979
I'm going to quit.

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,979
All right, so basically is you can't stand it.

91
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,599
You can't tolerate it anymore.

92
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,039
Exactly.

93
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,639
This is a phrase we use when we are really frustrated.

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,979
Yeah, when we're frustrated or when we just can't handle it anymore.

95
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:05,240
And well, after he finished his declaration of love, she responded by saying, Are you serious?

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,659
Are you serious?

97
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,099
Are you serious?

98
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:08,919
Are you serious?

99
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,840
Okay, so what does she mean?

100
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,639
She's just saying, really?

101
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,099
Exactly.

102
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:15,500
It's another way of saying really.

103
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:15,919
Yep.

104
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,819
So this is a phrase that's really, it's quite informal, isn't it?

105
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't use it in a business context.

106
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,920
No, and it's also something that's used mostly by younger people.

107
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,259
Right.

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,139
If you say something that's amazing or that's incredible, hard to believe, you might get this response.

109
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,600
Are you confess that he never had the guts to tell her?

110
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:39,279
Mm hmm.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,100
Have the guts.

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,800
I never had the guts to tell you.

113
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,360
I never had the guts.

114
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,759
All right, so to have guts.

115
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:49,360
That's to be brave.

116
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,839
To be brave, courageous.

117
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:51,279
Yep.

118
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,959
So we have some examples of how we would use guts in different situations.

119
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,860
So I don't have the guts to go skydiving.

120
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,399
Example two.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,060
I don't have the guts to give a speech.

122
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:22,899
Example three.

123
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,600
I've never had the guts to say no to my boss.

124
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:36,240
All right, so to have the guts to do something.

125
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,459
Hey, but Marco, this word guts, it's an interesting one.

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,079
Yes, it is.

127
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:46,699
Because guts can also mean your internal organs, like your stomach and your intestines and your lungs.

128
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:47,339
Exactly.

129
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:48,439
Those are your guts.

130
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:48,800
Yep.

131
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,000
So when you have guts, you're really brave.

132
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,779
Exactly.

133
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:52,560
You're courageous.

134
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,360
Mm hmm.

135
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:53,939
All right.

136
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:54,500
Very good.

137
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,139
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time?

138
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,720
We're gonna slow it down a little bit.

139
00:05:59,019 --> 00:06:01,459
And we'll come back and look at some phrases in putting it together.

140
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,959
Hey, you're early.

141
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,139
Where's everyone?

142
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,199
Well, I told them not to come.

143
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,959
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

144
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,740
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

145
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:17,879
Oh, why?

146
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:22,439
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

147
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,420
Sure.

148
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:24,819
What is it?

149
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:25,939
Hmm.

150
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,459
Okay.

151
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,779
Here's the thing.

152
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:31,720
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

153
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,319
And I can't take it anymore.

154
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,240
I know you better than anyone.

155
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,980
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

156
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,620
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

157
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,060
I think we would be great together.

158
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,800
Don't you?

159
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,079
Are you serious?

160
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,560
We've been friends for years.

161
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:52,000
We can't just change that overnight.

162
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:53,040
I know.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,600
I've never had the guts to tell you until today.

164
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,480
So what do you say?

165
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,420
Are you willing to give me a shot?

166
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:09,519
I, I...

167
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,779
Alright, that's a little bit clearer this time.

168
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:18,160
But while I was listening, I noticed that there's some more great phrases that you can use together with different words.

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,180
So let's look at those now.

170
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,220
I'm putting it together.

171
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,699
Putting it together.

172
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:27,220
Alright, let's take a look at the first one.

173
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:31,399
He said I made a reservation just for the two of us.

174
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,819
The two of us.

175
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,639
Just the two of us.

176
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,279
So just the two of us.

177
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,879
Quite simply, it means you and me.

178
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:39,620
Just us, right?

179
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:39,959
Right.

180
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,720
Just us.

181
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,920
So, so why is this phrase important?

182
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,019
I think it's a great way to show the idea of only us, right?

183
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,680
Right.

184
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,339
And we can use it together with any number we want.

185
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:52,519
So what about the four of us?

186
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:52,959
Mm-hmm.

187
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,300
Just the four of us.

188
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:54,860
Okay.

189
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,060
Just the eight of us.

190
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:56,800
Okay.

191
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,439
So, it suggests the idea of only us.

192
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

193
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,240
So he made the reservation just for the two of us, because he thought they could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

194
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,600
All to ourselves.

195
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,939
All to ourselves.

196
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,959
All to ourselves.

197
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,579
If you have something all to yourself, or we have something all to ourselves.

198
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,680
We have that thing all alone.

199
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,819
We don't have to share it.

200
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,560
We don't share.

201
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:23,180
Very good.

202
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,360
So I guess you can say, my parents are out of town, so I have the apartment.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,319
I have the house all to myself.

204
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:31,740
Mm-hmm.

205
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,480
Or even she wants to eat the cake all to herself.

206
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,000
Very good.

207
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,379
So that's a very good phrase.

208
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,980
And you can use it with any pronoun.

209
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,940
Well, so the guy is explaining that I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

210
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,559
I've always seen you as.

211
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,919
I've always seen you as.

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,419
So basically is the perception or the way you consider that person.

213
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,259
The way you think about that person.

214
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,279
So I can say, I've always seen you as a good friend.

215
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,059
I've always seen you as a leader.

216
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,019
Okay, so our last phrase is also the last thing we heard in the dialogue.

217
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,080
He said, are you willing to give me a shot?

218
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,659
Are you willing to give me a shot?

219
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,080
To give me a shot.

220
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,139
Give me a shot.

221
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:22,320
Alright, I think we have some more examples of how we could use give me a shot in different situations, so let's listen.

222
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,379
Example one.

223
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,100
I know I can do this drawing better.

224
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,159
Just give me a shot.

225
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,559
Example two.

226
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,919
The HR manager wasn't going to hire me, but he decided to give me a shot.

227
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,659
Okay, so when you give someone a shot, you take a chance, right?

228
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,639
Give that person or give an opportunity.

229
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:02,120
All right, so we don't know if she will give him a shot or not, but why don't we listen to the dialogue once more to hear these phrases in action.

230
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,980
Hey, you're early.

231
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,200
Where's everyone?

232
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,220
Well, I told them not to come.

233
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,379
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

234
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,759
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

235
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,259
Oh, why?

236
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,600
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

237
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,059
Sure, what is it?

238
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay, here's the thing.

239
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,340
I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it anymore.

240
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,200
I know you better than anyone.

241
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,480
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

242
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,779
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

243
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,340
I think we would be great together, don't you?

244
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Are you serious?

245
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,840
We've been friends for years.

246
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,740
We can't just change that overnight.

247
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:51,460
I know.

248
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,559
I never had the guts to tell you until today.

249
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,139
So what do you say?

250
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,679
Are you willing to give me a shot?

251
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:10,460
All right, so an interesting dialogue, and it opens up a cultural point.

252
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,039
That's right.

253
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,799
So in the dialogue, the guy was asking her if she would be his girlfriend, right?

254
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:25,059
Right, but I guess it's not very common among adults, at least, in English-speaking countries.

255
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,259
Yeah, we don't say like, okay, so please will you be my boyfriend now, you know?

256
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,039
Right, right, right.

257
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,379
You would do that maybe in high school.

258
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,700
Yeah, but even then, I think it's a little funny.

259
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,779
I think for us, when we start to have romantic relationships, it just sort of happens naturally, right?

260
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,720
You never really have this conversation, will you be my boyfriend?

261
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:55,600
Right, I guess afterwards, you just start talking about other things, which you just consider that you guys are already boyfriend and girlfriend.

262
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,720
Yeah, there's no real, there's no official starting point.

263
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:08,840
Yeah, there's no official point that says, okay, now we are boyfriend and girlfriend, which is interesting because in other countries, they do go through the formality of asking somebody to become their boyfriend.

264
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,480
Yeah, but even, you know, like 20 or 30 years ago in English-speaking countries, you would do this.

265
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,120
Oh yeah, of course.

266
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:16,679
And it was called going steady.

267
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,419
Going steady.

268
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,500
So you would ask, will you go steady with me?

269
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,059
That means let's become a stable couple.

270
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,639
Exactly.

271
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,779
All right, so we want to hear your stories and, well, how do you do it in your country?

272
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,080
Do you ask someone out?

273
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:32,379
Do you maybe just give them the first kiss and that's an automatic yes?

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,139
Well, I don't EnglishPod.com.

275
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,879
You can leave your questions and comments there.

276
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,720
All right, we'll see you guys there and until next time, goodbye!
