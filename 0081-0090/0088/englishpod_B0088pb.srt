00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're looking at some more romance.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're talking about dating.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Dating, exactly.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And not only dating, but asking someone to become your boyfriend or girlfriend.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yep, that's true.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And so we're going to be focusing on language to express your romantic feelings.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And also maybe some phrases you can use to ask someone out.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Very good.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So I'm sure you guys are excited about this one.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, you're early.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Where's everyone?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, I told them not to come.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, why?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Sure.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What is it?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, here's the thing.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And I can't take it anymore.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know you better than anyone.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think we would be great together, don't you?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you serious?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
We've been friends for years.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We can't just change that overnight.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I know.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I never had the guts to tell you until today.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So what do you say?

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right, I wonder, is she going to say yes?

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
She seems a little bit confused.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, I guess it's always strange when your best friend suddenly wants to be your boyfriend or girlfriend.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It does happen though.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It does happen.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this dialogue to express these feelings.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And let's start with fluency builder.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Fluency builder.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, so we're doing things a little differently today.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're looking at phrases and not just vocabulary words.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So he used some wonderful phrases to ask her to be his boyfriend.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And he started with this.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here's the thing.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Here's the thing.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right, that's a very strange phrase.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Here's the thing.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is he giving her something?

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Not quite.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's not giving her an object, but he's giving her some information.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so it's a very common way to start an idea.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're about to tell the person the main problem or the main piece of information.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Right, so you would start with here's the thing and then start explaining.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, why don't we do an example?

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
For example, you could say, all right, here's the thing.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
People don't like you.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right.

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, I hope they don't say that to me.

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But another example.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Marco, here's the thing.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're behind in our podcasting.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We have to work overtime.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, so the main idea.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yep.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Very good.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Moving on to our next phrase.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He said, I can't take it.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't take it anymore.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't take it anymore.

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So he can't take it anymore.

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Take what?

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, why don't we find out by listening to some examples?

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Example one.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The man next door has been so loud.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't take it anymore.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Example two.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My boss always yells at me.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't take it anymore.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Example three.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't take it anymore.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to quit.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All right, so basically is you can't stand it.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't tolerate it anymore.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Exactly.

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is a phrase we use when we are really frustrated.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, when we're frustrated or when we just can't handle it anymore.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And well, after he finished his declaration of love, she responded by saying, Are you serious?

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you serious?

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you serious?

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Are you serious?

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay, so what does she mean?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She's just saying, really?

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Exactly.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's another way of saying really.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yep.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So this is a phrase that's really, it's quite informal, isn't it?

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, I guess you wouldn't use it in a business context.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, and it's also something that's used mostly by younger people.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Right.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you say something that's amazing or that's incredible, hard to believe, you might get this response.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you confess that he never had the guts to tell her?

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mm hmm.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Have the guts.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I never had the guts to tell you.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I never had the guts.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
All right, so to have guts.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's to be brave.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
To be brave, courageous.

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yep.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So we have some examples of how we would use guts in different situations.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I don't have the guts to go skydiving.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Example two.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't have the guts to give a speech.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Example three.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I've never had the guts to say no to my boss.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right, so to have the guts to do something.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hey, but Marco, this word guts, it's an interesting one.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, it is.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Because guts can also mean your internal organs, like your stomach and your intestines and your lungs.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Exactly.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Those are your guts.

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yep.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So when you have guts, you're really brave.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Exactly.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're courageous.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mm hmm.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All right.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Very good.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the second time?

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We're gonna slow it down a little bit.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And we'll come back and look at some phrases in putting it together.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, you're early.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Where's everyone?

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, I told them not to come.

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, why?

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sure.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What is it?

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hmm.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Here's the thing.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I can't take it anymore.

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I know you better than anyone.

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think we would be great together.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't you?

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Are you serious?

160
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We've been friends for years.

161
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We can't just change that overnight.

162
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know.

163
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I've never had the guts to tell you until today.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So what do you say?

165
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I, I...

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Alright, that's a little bit clearer this time.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But while I was listening, I noticed that there's some more great phrases that you can use together with different words.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So let's look at those now.

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm putting it together.

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Putting it together.

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Alright, let's take a look at the first one.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He said I made a reservation just for the two of us.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The two of us.

175
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just the two of us.

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So just the two of us.

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Quite simply, it means you and me.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Just us, right?

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Right.

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Just us.

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So, so why is this phrase important?

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think it's a great way to show the idea of only us, right?

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And we can use it together with any number we want.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So what about the four of us?

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Mm-hmm.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Just the four of us.

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just the eight of us.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So, it suggests the idea of only us.

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So he made the reservation just for the two of us, because he thought they could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
All to ourselves.

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
All to ourselves.

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All to ourselves.

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
If you have something all to yourself, or we have something all to ourselves.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We have that thing all alone.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We don't have to share it.

200
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We don't share.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Very good.

202
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I guess you can say, my parents are out of town, so I have the apartment.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I have the house all to myself.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mm-hmm.

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or even she wants to eat the cake all to herself.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Very good.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So that's a very good phrase.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And you can use it with any pronoun.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, so the guy is explaining that I've always seen you as more than just a friend.

210
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I've always seen you as.

211
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I've always seen you as.

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So basically is the perception or the way you consider that person.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The way you think about that person.

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So I can say, I've always seen you as a good friend.

215
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've always seen you as a leader.

216
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, so our last phrase is also the last thing we heard in the dialogue.

217
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He said, are you willing to give me a shot?

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
To give me a shot.

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Give me a shot.

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Alright, I think we have some more examples of how we could use give me a shot in different situations, so let's listen.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Example one.

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I know I can do this drawing better.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Just give me a shot.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Example two.

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The HR manager wasn't going to hire me, but he decided to give me a shot.

227
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, so when you give someone a shot, you take a chance, right?

228
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Give that person or give an opportunity.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
All right, so we don't know if she will give him a shot or not, but why don't we listen to the dialogue once more to hear these phrases in action.

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey, you're early.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Where's everyone?

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I told them not to come.

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I made a reservation just for the two of us.

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I thought we could have a quiet evening all to ourselves.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, why?

236
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Jennifer, there's something I want to ask you.

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Sure, what is it?

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay, here's the thing.

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I've always seen you as more than just a friend, and I can't take it anymore.

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I know you better than anyone.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know the pros and cons of your personality.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I even know what side of the bed is yours.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think we would be great together, don't you?

244
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Are you serious?

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We've been friends for years.

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We can't just change that overnight.

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I know.

248
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I never had the guts to tell you until today.

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So what do you say?

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you willing to give me a shot?

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
All right, so an interesting dialogue, and it opens up a cultural point.

252
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So in the dialogue, the guy was asking her if she would be his girlfriend, right?

254
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Right, but I guess it's not very common among adults, at least, in English-speaking countries.

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah, we don't say like, okay, so please will you be my boyfriend now, you know?

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Right, right, right.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You would do that maybe in high school.

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, but even then, I think it's a little funny.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I think for us, when we start to have romantic relationships, it just sort of happens naturally, right?

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You never really have this conversation, will you be my boyfriend?

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Right, I guess afterwards, you just start talking about other things, which you just consider that you guys are already boyfriend and girlfriend.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, there's no real, there's no official starting point.

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, there's no official point that says, okay, now we are boyfriend and girlfriend, which is interesting because in other countries, they do go through the formality of asking somebody to become their boyfriend.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, but even, you know, like 20 or 30 years ago in English-speaking countries, you would do this.

265
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh yeah, of course.

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it was called going steady.

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Going steady.

268
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So you would ask, will you go steady with me?

269
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That means let's become a stable couple.

270
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Exactly.

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
All right, so we want to hear your stories and, well, how do you do it in your country?

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you ask someone out?

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you maybe just give them the first kiss and that's an automatic yes?

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, I don't EnglishPod.com.

275
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You can leave your questions and comments there.

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All right, we'll see you guys there and until next time, goodbye.
