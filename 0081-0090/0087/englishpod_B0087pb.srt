00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we're bringing you another sci-fi lesson for all of those fans out there of Star Trek and Star Wars.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right, and today we're going to focus on some phrases.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We're not going to do any vocabulary today, we're just going to learn some phrases that you'll find relating to science fiction.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, very good.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So why don't we listen to a dialogue for the first time and we'll come back and look at all these phrases.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is the nature of this attack?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I am Captain Kor on the ship Kotos, your ship attack down search party.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, you're not doing it right.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Kor doesn't sound like that.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
His voice is deeper.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I am Captain Kor on the ship Kotos, your ship- No!

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you can't do an authentic Klingon voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan who can actually act, okay?

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But, but, I already fought the Klingon suit and the wig, Ben.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
All right, very good.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Star Trek fans, apparently they were trying to act out one of the famous episodes where the Klingons attacked the Enterprise.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
My goodness.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know a lot about Star Trek, but I do know a lot about language, and we've got some great stuff here that will help you understand sci-fi movies and TV shows in English a little bit better.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So why don't we go now to Fluency Builder.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Fluency Builder All right, so the first phrase that we have today on Fluency Builder, unidentified ship.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
An unidentified ship.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Unidentified ship.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Unidentified ship.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If we break it down and look at the first word, unidentified.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You don't know which one it is.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, you don't know the identity.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yep.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And a ship, I guess that's short for- A rocket ship.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A rocket ship.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Or a spaceship.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we're not talking boats here.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, we're not talking about boats.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Very good.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now moving on to our second phrase, the Enterprise lost its warp drive.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Warp drive.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Warp drive.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Warp drive.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So the warp drive of the Enterprise is actually something like an engine that allows it to go faster than the speed of light.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So super fast.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Super fast.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But why warp?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right, well if we take a look at the word warp, that actually means to bend.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yep.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So like when you warp wood, it bends.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Exactly.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You bend wood or you warp metal.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And well, that's kind of the theory behind it is that they're going so fast that they bend or warp time.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, so warp drive.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think a very sci-fi specific phrase here.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All right, and for our third phrase today, search party.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Search party.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A search party.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A search party.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, so what is this?

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are we having a party?

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's going on?

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, when somebody gets lost, you know, maybe in the woods or something, you send out a search party to find them.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So a party would be a group of people.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Exactly.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So that also happens in restaurants, I think, right?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sometimes you might say, how many people in your party?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In your party.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Very good.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So party group of people.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All right.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So in the dialogue, we saw that actually these were not real Star Trek characters, but they were just acting.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But it didn't sound quite right, right?

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, he said that his voice is deeper.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So a deep voice.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Deep voice.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A deep voice.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to hear an example of what a deep voice sounds like.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The one constant through all the years, Ray, has been baseball.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
America has rolled by like an army of steamrollers.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's been erased like a blackboard, rebuilt and erased again.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That is a deep voice.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, because his voice wasn't deep enough, he didn't sound authentic.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Authentic.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Authentic.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All right.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So authentic, very easy word.

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Real.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
True to life.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
True to life.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right.

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Not fake.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Exactly.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So Marco, is that an authentic Rolex?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, it's not.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But thank you for noticing.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So authentic.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And our last word for today.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A wig.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A wig.

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
A wig.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wig.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
W-I-G.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Wig.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So a wig is pretend hair, right?

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Right.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Fake hair.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So the hair is not authentic.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Very good.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
All right.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So a wig.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
All right.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We've got some great language here.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And why don't we listen to it one more time, slow down a little bit in the dialogue.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Captain, we're under attack by an unidentified ship.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Damage report.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We've sustained heavy damages to the engines.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We've lost our warp drive.

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We'll have to attempt to make contact.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is Captain Picard of the Starship Enterprise.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We don't wish to engage.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What is the nature of this attack?

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I am Captain Kor of the ship Clothos.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your ship attacked our search party.

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're not doing it right.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Kor doesn't sound like that.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
His voice is deeper.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am Captain Kor of the ship Clothos.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Your ship.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you can't do an authentic Klingon voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan who can actually act okay.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But, but.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I already bought the Klingon suit and the wig.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
All right.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now it's time for us to take a look at more phrases today in Fluency Builder.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fluency Builder.

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So we've got some phrases here that you can use together with a number of different words, right?

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So the first one, we heard that Data said we're under attack.

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We're under attack.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Under attack.

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So if we're under attack, it means that we are being attacked, attacked.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Someone is shooting guns at you or trying to hurt you or something like that.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So we are under attack.

149
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Very popular phrase that you would hear in war movies or something.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Definitely.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now you can change this by changing the last word.

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We are under fire.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Under fire, which basically means the same thing.

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah.

155
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Except it when you're under fire.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There are guns involved.

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So they're shooting.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yep.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We're under attack.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're under fire.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All right.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Moving on to our second phrase.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We've sustained heavy damage.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sustain heavy damage.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So when you sustain something, you receive it or you undergo this thing.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So usually it's related to injury or to receiving some type of...

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Of negative thing.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Okay.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we could use sustain in context.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Luckily, the warship didn't sustain any serious damage.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
All right.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So you see, we typically sustain something like an injury or damage that is negative.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Very good.

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the last phrase for today.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What is the nature of this attack?

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What is the nature of?

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is the nature of?

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So basically he's just asking, why are you doing this?

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right.

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why?

183
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What is the reason?

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What is the purpose?

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So again, we have some more examples of how you could use what is the nature of in different situations.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Example one.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What is the nature of your visits to the United States?

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Example two.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is the nature of the threat against our country?

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Example three.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The nature of my visit is personal.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So a great phrase you can use, not only when you're talking sci-fi, but in everyday life.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Exactly.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So why don't we listen now to the dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Captain, we're under attack by an unidentified ship.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Damage report.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We've sustained heavy damages to the engines.

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We've lost our warp drive.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
We'll have to attempt to make contact.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the Starship Enterprise.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We don't wish to engage.

204
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What is the nature of this attack?

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I am Captain Kor of the ship Krotos, your ship attack down search party.

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No, you're not doing it right.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Kor doesn't sound like that.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
His voice is deeper.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I am Captain Kor of the ship Krotos, your ship- No!

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If you can't do an authentic Klingon voice, I'll have to find a more serious Star Trek fan who can actually act, okay?

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But, but, I already bought the Klingon suit and the wig, man.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well Marco, I already admitted that I'm not much of a sci-fi fan and I don't really know anything about Star Trek or Star Wars.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, it is a very popular show.

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think it started around the 60s or 70s.

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The first version of Star Trek and well, many, many people follow it now.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They dress up.

217
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They know the secret language that is used on the show.

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They know the spaceships.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's a big culture.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's true.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And speaking of culture, I think we've got a Star Trek movie coming out pretty soon, so some of this language can help you guys understand it a little bit better.

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Very good, yeah.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
