00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,459
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,740
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,459
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:05,480
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,800
And today we're bringing you the eighth part of our dramatic romantic love story, I'm Sorry I Love You.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:12,519
That's right.

7
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:15,500
We're coming close to the end of this story, aren't we?

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,559
Yeah, we're coming close to the end and we still have a lot of interesting things going on, so I wonder what's going to happen.

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:29,160
Well, I can tell you that today's lesson involves this word, which we'll hear in Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:36,579
So today we're just going to look at this one word, spy.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:37,659
A spy.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,060
A spy.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:39,799
Spy.

14
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:44,740
Alright, so we probably know famous spies like James Bond.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,299
Or Austin Powers.

16
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:46,859
Right.

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,100
So basically it's a person who is secretly trying to get information.

18
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:53,899
About a government or maybe a business.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Right.

20
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,100
So that's a spy.

21
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,820
Now the verb, to spy.

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,119
Same thing, right?

23
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,780
To spy on someone.

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,000
To spy on a company.

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,379
So why are we talking spies and spying here on EnglishPod?

26
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:09,980
Why don't we find out by listening to our dialogue?

27
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:28,760
Veronica?

28
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Veronica?

29
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,560
Veronica, are you okay?

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,719
Steven, what's going on?

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,400
Who were those guys?

32
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:38,840
I didn't know you have a gun.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,079
What's going on?

34
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,420
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, okay?

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,920
For now you have to trust me.

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,920
Please, I would never do anything to hurt you.

37
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,780
Steven, I- Okay, run!

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,900
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,199
I'm not a fireman.

41
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,319
I'm not even from the United States.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,740
I'm a spy for the Indian government.

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:17,500
What?

44
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,539
Why didn't you tell me before?

45
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,039
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,419
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

47
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,659
It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist.

48
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:42,300
One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university, where he taught biochemistry.

49
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:43,939
I never saw him again.

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,599
I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father, and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,599
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us?

52
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,539
And I'm sorry.

53
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,580
I wasn't supposed to meet you.

54
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:04,659
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

55
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,219
I can't believe this.

56
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,719
Why are all these things happening to me?

57
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,500
I can't take it anymore.

58
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,620
Let me out of the car.

59
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,599
Veronica, wait!

60
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,599
All right, so Steven is not even American.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,860
He's an Indian spy.

62
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,840
He's not even a firefighter.

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,620
Well, there you go.

64
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,319
Oh my god.

65
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,680
Many surprises on this love story.

66
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,219
It gets deeper and deeper.

67
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:42,939
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this great story in Language Takeaway.

68
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,759
Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,780
Well, here we've got a lot of language that you can use when you need to be honest about something.

70
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:55,719
We're going to look at six phrases here.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,719
Now, the first one, Steven says he needs to come clean.

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Come clean.

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,340
Come clean.

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,379
Right, so basically he needs to tell the truth.

75
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,699
He needs to confess.

76
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:07,780
Confess, right?

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,199
About something that he maybe wasn't truthful about in the past.

78
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,360
Yeah, maybe he had a secret or maybe he lied about something.

79
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:15,639
Yep.

80
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,079
So now he's coming clean.

81
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,680
Very good.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,240
So he comes clean and he tells the story about his childhood and he says his father was a renowned chemist.

83
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,459
Renowned.

84
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:29,560
Renowned.

85
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,560
Okay, so if you are a renowned chemist.

86
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,160
You're very famous and well respected.

87
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,899
So you can use that with people or with places.

88
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,519
A renowned restaurant.

89
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, so very popular.

90
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,339
Very well known.

91
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:44,420
Yeah, we also hear it's commonly like this.

92
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:46,959
A world renowned chemist.

93
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,939
A world renowned restaurant.

94
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
So not only popular locally but the whole world knows about it.

95
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,319
Very good.

96
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,779
All right, and so he continues with his story and he says he was approached by members of the CIA.

97
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:01,339
Approached.

98
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,660
To be approached by.

99
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,620
Okay, so if I am approached by somebody from the CIA, what does that mean?

100
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,040
Well, they come to talk to you about something really important.

101
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,579
Okay, so the verb to approach someone can mean get close to.

102
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,819
Right, to walk up to them or something like that.

103
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,040
Right, but it also carries this meaning of coming to talk to you about something.

104
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,160
Something important.

105
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:28,279
Something very important.

106
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:28,519
Yeah.

107
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,720
So for example, I can say my boss approached me this morning to talk about an important pay raise.

108
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,939
Oh, lucky you.

109
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,399
Or maybe Jim approached me to ask if I know if his wife is cheating on him or not.

110
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:41,920
Wow.

111
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,699
All right, so that's how you would use this verb approach someone.

112
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,139
Now let's move on to the next word.

113
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:53,339
So he was approached by members of the CIA and they were claiming something about his father.

114
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,439
That's right, so to claim.

115
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:56,980
Claim something.

116
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,019
To claim something.

117
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:03,120
All right, so basically when you're claiming something you are saying that it's true.

118
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,220
Right, it might not be true.

119
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,279
But we don't know.

120
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah, so for example, he claims he makes four million dollars a year.

121
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,639
Okay, or Bob claims that he saw UFO.

122
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,639
We can't prove it if it's true or not, but that's what they're saying is true.

123
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,860
Yep, so Stephen's father disappeared and, well, he vowed to discover where he was.

124
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,540
So Stephen vowed to find his father.

125
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:30,240
Vow.

126
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,300
To vow.

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,600
So this verb to vow means to make a strong promise, right?

128
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:35,959
Yes.

129
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,199
And we use it also in marriage, right?

130
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:39,060
Wedding vows.

131
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,279
Wedding vows, which are basically promises.

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,819
So if you vow something you make a very strong promise.

133
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,319
Yes, it's very very bad if you break a vow.

134
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:47,920
Oh really?

135
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:48,959
What happens?

136
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,399
I don't know, probably thunder strikes you and you die.

137
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,079
All right, so don't break your vows.

138
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:55,519
Yeah.

139
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,279
And the last word on language takeaway today, the whereabouts.

140
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,920
The whereabouts.

141
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,259
The whereabouts of his father.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,740
So the whereabouts is the location.

143
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:08,680
The location.

144
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,519
Kind of unknown location, right?

145
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,040
Right.

146
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,300
I think this is a great word for us to listen to some more examples.

147
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,259
Example one.

148
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,920
The police don't have any information on the whereabouts of the murderer.

149
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,220
Example two.

150
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,019
Currently the whereabouts of the president are unknown.

151
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,180
Example three.

152
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,399
You live in Toronto too?

153
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,740
Whereabouts do you live?

154
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,759
All right, so whereabouts.

155
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,399
Perfect.

156
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,279
You can use it for location.

157
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,180
Unknown location.

158
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,959
All right, so some great words.

159
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:02,160
Now I want to move on to some phrases that we heard in the dialogue and let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

160
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,800
Fluency Builder.

161
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,060
All right, on Fluency Builder today we have four great phrases and let's start with the first one.

162
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,920
What's going on?

163
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:16,879
So Veronica asks, what's going on?

164
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,720
Steven, what's going on?

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,339
Basically what's happening, right?

166
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,259
What's happening?

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,279
What's the situation?

168
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:23,759
Yeah.

169
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:30,139
Now another interesting thing is that among friends you could use this phrase to say, hey, how are you?

170
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,639
How are you?

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,259
How's it going?

172
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:31,519
Right?

173
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,820
So you can say, hey, Erica, what's going on?

174
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,000
And it all depends on your tone of voice.

175
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:40,379
So when you want to know how that person is, hey, Marco, what's going on?

176
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,080
Right.

177
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,860
But if you're angry or maybe something strange is happening, you're like, hey, what's going on here?

178
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,340
Yes.

179
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,460
So your voice falls.

180
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,120
Right.

181
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,019
Now let's take a look at our next phrase.

182
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,240
And this one is very, very useful, especially if you've lied.

183
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:56,779
Yes.

184
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,039
So Steven says, I haven't been completely honest with you.

185
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,860
I haven't been completely honest with you.

186
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,960
I haven't been completely honest with you.

187
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,220
So that means he hasn't been telling the whole truth.

188
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:09,720
Right.

189
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,259
Pretty easy to understand, but I think its use is interesting here.

190
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:14,840
Right.

191
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:19,639
You might use it to kind of soften up the person to confess something.

192
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Right.

193
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:28,159
So when you're ready to come clean about a secret you have or a lie you told, this is a great way to prepare your listener.

194
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:28,679
Right.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,639
You know what?

196
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,580
I haven't been completely honest with you.

197
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:31,820
Yeah.

198
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,299
Moving on to our third phrase.

199
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,639
So the CIA claimed that Steven's father had made the discovery of the millennium.

200
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,360
The discovery of the millennium.

201
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,440
Discovery of the millennium.

202
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,539
Okay.

203
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,620
Let's break this down.

204
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:46,559
Millennium.

205
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,159
Millennium is a thousand years.

206
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:49,580
Right.

207
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:57,259
So the discovery of the millennium is the best, most important discovery in the past thousand years.

208
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:57,840
Right.

209
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,279
So now we can change it a little bit and say the invention of the millennium or even the party of the millennium.

210
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:04,940
Exactly.

211
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:10,539
So it doesn't necessarily have to be the most important of the last 1000 years, but it means it was pretty good.

212
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:11,299
It was pretty good.

213
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,120
Very important.

214
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,360
Yeah.

215
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:15,799
Hey, you can also say the, the discovery of the decade, right?

216
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,879
Of the decade of the century of the year.

217
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,220
Yep.

218
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,759
And now let's take a look at our last phrase.

219
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,679
So Steven confessed, he came clean, he told her everything, but he said he wasn't supposed to fall in love with her.

220
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,580
I wasn't supposed to.

221
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,340
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

222
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:33,919
All right.

223
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,960
So let's look at this phrase.

224
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,679
I wasn't supposed to.

225
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,139
It's an interesting one.

226
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:44,620
It's sort of like a cross between I didn't need to, and I shouldn't have done.

227
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,320
Right.

228
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,440
Now let's look at some examples.

229
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:51,059
I wasn't supposed to come to work today.

230
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:51,960
All right.

231
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,740
So you didn't need to.

232
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:53,720
It wasn't necessary.

233
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,360
All right.

234
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,500
So maybe it was your annual vacation day, but you came into work anyway.

235
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,059
Or maybe it was a holiday and I came to work anyways.

236
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,960
So, so the plan was not for you to come to work.

237
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,419
Right.

238
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,899
So in this case, we're saying it wasn't necessary or it wasn't planned or planned.

239
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:10,179
Yep.

240
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,220
Now let's look at it the other way when you shouldn't.

241
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Okay.

242
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,399
Marco, I wasn't supposed to tell you this, but.

243
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:17,320
Okay.

244
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,500
So now in this case, you shouldn't be telling me this.

245
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,460
You shouldn't tell me the secret, but you're going to anyways.

246
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:24,860
Yes.

247
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:25,860
Off air.

248
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,600
So I wasn't supposed to.

249
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,779
In this case, it means I shouldn't.

250
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:31,879
All right.

251
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,299
Some really great language here.

252
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:36,940
Now I think it would help us to hear it one more time in the dialogue.

253
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:59,840
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, are you okay?

254
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,139
Steven, what's going on?

255
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,799
Who were those guys?

256
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:07,240
I didn't know you have a gun.

257
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,500
What's going on?

258
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,519
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety.

259
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:10,820
Okay.

260
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,639
For now you have to trust me, please.

261
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,340
I would never do anything to hurt you.

262
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:14,779
Steven.

263
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Okay.

264
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,200
Run.

265
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,299
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica.

266
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,100
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,620
I'm not a fireman.

268
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm not even from the United States.

269
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,139
I'm a spy for the Indian government.

270
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:45,919
What?

271
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,940
Why didn't you tell me before?

272
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,460
What are you doing here?

273
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,820
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

274
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,080
It was a peaceful town and my father was a renowned chemist.

275
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:10,679
One day he was approached by members of the CIA claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught biochemistry.

276
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:12,360
I never saw him again.

277
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,000
I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

278
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,940
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us?

279
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:24,940
And I'm sorry.

280
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,980
I wasn't supposed to meet you.

281
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,139
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

282
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,039
But you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

283
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,620
I can't believe this.

284
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,120
Why are all these things happening to me?

285
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,899
I can't take it anymore.

286
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,000
Let me out of the car.

287
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,039
Veronica, wait.

288
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,240
OK, great.

289
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,220
So now we're getting close to the end of this series.

290
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,179
So what's going to happen?

291
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,820
Maybe Veronica is also a spy.

292
00:13:57,019 --> 00:13:57,559
Oh, my God.

293
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,940
I don't think I can handle that.

294
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:00,139
All right.

295
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,460
So we really need your suggestions.

296
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,379
We need your ideas.

297
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:07,840
We want to know how you think the series ends or how you would want it to end.

298
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,179
Do you want it to be a happy ending or a tragedy or maybe action filled ending?

299
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,860
All right.

300
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,240
Well, we've got two lessons left in the series.

301
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,320
So visit our Web site at EnglishPod.com and leave your suggestions.

302
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,159
All right, guys, we'll see you guys there.

303
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,559
And until next time.

304
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:22,919
Goodbye.
