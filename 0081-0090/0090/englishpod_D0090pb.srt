00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're bringing you the eighth part of our dramatic romantic love story, I'm Sorry I Love You.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're coming close to the end of this story, aren't we?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, we're coming close to the end and we still have a lot of interesting things going on, so I wonder what's going to happen.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, I can tell you that today's lesson involves this word, which we'll hear in Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So today we're just going to look at this one word, spy.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
A spy.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A spy.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Spy.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Alright, so we probably know famous spies like James Bond.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Or Austin Powers.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Right.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So basically it's a person who is secretly trying to get information.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
About a government or maybe a business.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Right.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So that's a spy.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Now the verb, to spy.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Same thing, right?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To spy on someone.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To spy on a company.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So why are we talking spies and spying here on EnglishPod?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why don't we find out by listening to our dialogue?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Veronica?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Veronica?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Veronica, are you okay?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Steven, what's going on?

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Who were those guys?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I didn't know you have a gun.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What's going on?

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, okay?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
For now you have to trust me.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Please, I would never do anything to hurt you.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Steven, I- Okay, run!

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm not a fireman.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not even from the United States.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm a spy for the Indian government.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why didn't you tell me before?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What are you doing here?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university, where he taught biochemistry.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I never saw him again.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father, and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I'm sorry.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I wasn't supposed to meet you.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't believe this.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why are all these things happening to me?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I can't take it anymore.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let me out of the car.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Veronica, wait!

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right, so Steven is not even American.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's an Indian spy.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He's not even a firefighter.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, there you go.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh my god.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Many surprises on this love story.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It gets deeper and deeper.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, why don't we take a look at some of the vocabulary that was used in this great story in Language Takeaway.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, here we've got a lot of language that you can use when you need to be honest about something.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We're going to look at six phrases here.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now, the first one, Steven says he needs to come clean.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Come clean.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Come clean.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Right, so basically he needs to tell the truth.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He needs to confess.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Confess, right?

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
About something that he maybe wasn't truthful about in the past.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, maybe he had a secret or maybe he lied about something.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yep.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So now he's coming clean.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Very good.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So he comes clean and he tells the story about his childhood and he says his father was a renowned chemist.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Renowned.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Renowned.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, so if you are a renowned chemist.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're very famous and well respected.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So you can use that with people or with places.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A renowned restaurant.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, so very popular.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Very well known.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, we also hear it's commonly like this.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A world renowned chemist.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
A world renowned restaurant.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So not only popular locally but the whole world knows about it.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Very good.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All right, and so he continues with his story and he says he was approached by members of the CIA.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Approached.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
To be approached by.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, so if I am approached by somebody from the CIA, what does that mean?

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, they come to talk to you about something really important.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, so the verb to approach someone can mean get close to.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right, to walk up to them or something like that.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Right, but it also carries this meaning of coming to talk to you about something.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Something important.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Something very important.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So for example, I can say my boss approached me this morning to talk about an important pay raise.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, lucky you.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Or maybe Jim approached me to ask if I know if his wife is cheating on him or not.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wow.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All right, so that's how you would use this verb approach someone.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now let's move on to the next word.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So he was approached by members of the CIA and they were claiming something about his father.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's right, so to claim.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Claim something.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To claim something.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All right, so basically when you're claiming something you are saying that it's true.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right, it might not be true.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But we don't know.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, so for example, he claims he makes four million dollars a year.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay, or Bob claims that he saw UFO.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We can't prove it if it's true or not, but that's what they're saying is true.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yep, so Stephen's father disappeared and, well, he vowed to discover where he was.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So Stephen vowed to find his father.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Vow.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
To vow.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So this verb to vow means to make a strong promise, right?

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And we use it also in marriage, right?

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Wedding vows.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Wedding vows, which are basically promises.

132
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So if you vow something you make a very strong promise.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes, it's very very bad if you break a vow.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh really?

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What happens?

136
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I don't know, probably thunder strikes you and you die.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
All right, so don't break your vows.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And the last word on language takeaway today, the whereabouts.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The whereabouts.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The whereabouts of his father.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So the whereabouts is the location.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The location.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Kind of unknown location, right?

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Right.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think this is a great word for us to listen to some more examples.

147
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Example one.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The police don't have any information on the whereabouts of the murderer.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Example two.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Currently the whereabouts of the president are unknown.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Example three.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You live in Toronto too?

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Whereabouts do you live?

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
All right, so whereabouts.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Perfect.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can use it for location.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Unknown location.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
All right, so some great words.

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now I want to move on to some phrases that we heard in the dialogue and let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Fluency Builder.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All right, on Fluency Builder today we have four great phrases and let's start with the first one.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's going on?

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So Veronica asks, what's going on?

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Steven, what's going on?

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Basically what's happening, right?

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's happening?

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's the situation?

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now another interesting thing is that among friends you could use this phrase to say, hey, how are you?

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How are you?

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How's it going?

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right?

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So you can say, hey, Erica, what's going on?

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And it all depends on your tone of voice.

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So when you want to know how that person is, hey, Marco, what's going on?

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Right.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But if you're angry or maybe something strange is happening, you're like, hey, what's going on here?

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So your voice falls.

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now let's take a look at our next phrase.

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And this one is very, very useful, especially if you've lied.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes.

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So Steven says, I haven't been completely honest with you.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I haven't been completely honest with you.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I haven't been completely honest with you.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So that means he hasn't been telling the whole truth.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Pretty easy to understand, but I think its use is interesting here.

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Right.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You might use it to kind of soften up the person to confess something.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So when you're ready to come clean about a secret you have or a lie you told, this is a great way to prepare your listener.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Right.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You know what?

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I haven't been completely honest with you.

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yeah.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Moving on to our third phrase.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So the CIA claimed that Steven's father had made the discovery of the millennium.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The discovery of the millennium.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Discovery of the millennium.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's break this down.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Millennium.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Millennium is a thousand years.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So the discovery of the millennium is the best, most important discovery in the past thousand years.

208
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Right.

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So now we can change it a little bit and say the invention of the millennium or even the party of the millennium.

210
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Exactly.

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it doesn't necessarily have to be the most important of the last 1000 years, but it means it was pretty good.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It was pretty good.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Very important.

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yeah.

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Hey, you can also say the, the discovery of the decade, right?

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Of the decade of the century of the year.

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yep.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And now let's take a look at our last phrase.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So Steven confessed, he came clean, he told her everything, but he said he wasn't supposed to fall in love with her.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I wasn't supposed to.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
All right.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So let's look at this phrase.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I wasn't supposed to.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's an interesting one.

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's sort of like a cross between I didn't need to, and I shouldn't have done.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Right.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Now let's look at some examples.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I wasn't supposed to come to work today.

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
All right.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So you didn't need to.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It wasn't necessary.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
All right.

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So maybe it was your annual vacation day, but you came into work anyway.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or maybe it was a holiday and I came to work anyways.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So, so the plan was not for you to come to work.

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Right.

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So in this case, we're saying it wasn't necessary or it wasn't planned or planned.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yep.

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now let's look at it the other way when you shouldn't.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Marco, I wasn't supposed to tell you this, but.

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So now in this case, you shouldn't be telling me this.

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You shouldn't tell me the secret, but you're going to anyways.

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Off air.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So I wasn't supposed to.

249
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
In this case, it means I shouldn't.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
All right.

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Some really great language here.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Now I think it would help us to hear it one more time in the dialogue.

253
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Veronica, Veronica, Veronica, are you okay?

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Steven, what's going on?

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Who were those guys?

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I didn't know you have a gun.

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's going on?

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I will come clean as soon as we get to safety.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For now you have to trust me, please.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I would never do anything to hurt you.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Steven.

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay.

264
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Run.

265
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica.

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not a fireman.

268
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm not even from the United States.

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm a spy for the Indian government.

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What?

271
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why didn't you tell me before?

272
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What are you doing here?

273
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was a peaceful town and my father was a renowned chemist.

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,000
One day he was approached by members of the CIA claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught biochemistry.

276
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I never saw him again.

277
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us?

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I'm sorry.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I wasn't supposed to meet you.

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

282
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can't believe this.

284
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why are all these things happening to me?

285
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I can't take it anymore.

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let me out of the car.

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Veronica, wait.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
OK, great.

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So now we're getting close to the end of this series.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So what's going to happen?

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Maybe Veronica is also a spy.

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, my God.

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't think I can handle that.

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
All right.

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So we really need your suggestions.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We need your ideas.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We want to know how you think the series ends or how you would want it to end.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Do you want it to be a happy ending or a tragedy or maybe action filled ending?

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
All right.

300
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Well, we've got two lessons left in the series.

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So visit our Web site at EnglishPod.com and leave your suggestions.

302
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
All right, guys, we'll see you guys there.

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And until next time.

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Goodbye.
