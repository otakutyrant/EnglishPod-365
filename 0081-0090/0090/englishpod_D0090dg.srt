00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:33,000
EnglishPod.com I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, okay?

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For now, you have to trust me.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Please, I would never do anything to hurt you.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Steven, I- Okay, run!

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Steven!

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I haven't been completely honest with you, Veronica.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not a fireman.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not even from the United States.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm a spy for the Indian government.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why didn't you tell me before?

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket with my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university, where he taught biochemistry.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I never saw him again.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father, and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What does that have to do with those men shooting at us?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And most importantly, why did you lie to me?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I wasn't supposed to meet you.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I can't believe this.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why are all these things happening to me?

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't take it anymore.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let me out of the car!

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Veronica, wait!
