00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Hi, we are the Christiansons.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're here to see the apartment.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, hi.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Sure.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on in.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has done everything.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It looks great.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's so bright and airy.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What great light.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I really love these hardwood floors.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's the square footage of this place?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, it's about 120 square meters, or 1,300 square feet, more or less.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's a new dishwasher and a professional-grade gas range.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Really, at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I love it.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But wait, what are the payment terms?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
First and last month rent as deposit, and rent is due on the first of every month.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, it is.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Too good to be true.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suite bathroom.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean, the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Uh, what do you mean?

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's in here?

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ahhhhhh!
