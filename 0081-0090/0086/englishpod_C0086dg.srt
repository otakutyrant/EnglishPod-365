00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:09,400
EnglishPod.com Hi, we are the Christiansons.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,359
We're here to see the apartment.

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:11,220
Oh, hi.

4
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:11,720
Sure.

5
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:12,699
Come on in.

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,439
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,219
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has done everything.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,000
It looks great.

9
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:24,199
It's so bright and airy.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,739
What great light.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,239
I really love these hardwood floors.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,719
What's the square footage of this place?

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,859
Well, it's about 120 square meters, or 1,300 square feet, more or less.

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,880
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

15
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,039
There's a new dishwasher and a professional-grade gas range.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,159
Really, at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,200
I love it.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,579
But wait, what are the payment terms?

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,460
First and last month rent as deposit, and rent is due on the first of every month.

20
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:01,859
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,240
Yes, it is.

22
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,620
Too good to be true.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,159
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

25
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:14,599
It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suite bathroom.

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,819
We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean, the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,739
Uh, what do you mean?

28
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,180
What's in here?

29
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,159
Ahhhhh!
