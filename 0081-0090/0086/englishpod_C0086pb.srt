00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to the EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we have a special lesson for all of you who are looking for a new apartment or house.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Or even if you're not looking for an apartment, this lesson will be useful because it can help you describe what your current apartment or house looks like.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right, so we're going to be describing an apartment, another vocabulary related to apartment hunting.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why don't we take a look at some of the first words that we have in Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're going to hear these two words in the dialogue.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first one is landlord.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Landlord.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Landlord.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Alright, so who is a landlord or what is a landlord?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, it's pretty simple.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
A landlord is the person who owns the house.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Or apartment.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the owner of the house.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Right.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And a landlord rents out the apartment to the tenants.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, very good.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Tenants.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Tenants.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So the tenants are the people that are renting the apartment or house.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Exactly.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Two important words that we'll find in the dialogue.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Tenants and landlord.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So why don't we take a listen to the dialogue now and we'll hear as a couple is checking out a new apartment.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi, we are the Christiansons.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We're here to see the apartment.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, hi.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Short.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Come on in.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has done everything.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It looks great.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's so bright and airy.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What great light.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I really love these hardwood floors.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's the square footage of this place?

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, it's about 120 square meters or 1300 square feet, more or less.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Really at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I love it.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But wait, what are the payment terms?

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the first of every month.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes, it is.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Too good to be true.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suite bathroom.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean, the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Uh, what do you mean?

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What's in here?

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's the bathroom.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Alright, so apparently the apartment was too good to be true.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, I don't think that's exactly what they were expecting to find in the bathroom.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Exactly.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, we did find a lot of great words and phrases, so why don't we take a look at that now in Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Language Takeaway We're just going to look at a bunch of vocabulary items related to apartments and house huntings.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So we've got a lot to cover here, so let's get started with the first one.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Renovated.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Renovated.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Renovated.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Right, so, and the apartment was newly renovated.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, so the verb to renovate, a great word and I think some examples will help us understand the meaning.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Example one.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I had to renovate my kitchen because I accidentally burned everything while cooking.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Example two.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The city recently renovated the ceiling of the local church.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Example three.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
John is planning on renovating his nightclub so as to make it more modern.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, so basically to renovate means to make new again.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Right, when you renovate a house or an apartment, you take everything down and build it back up again.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, so it's usually only used for buildings, for apartments, for houses.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Or offices.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You don't say you renovate your computer.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And also, when you just do something really simple like change the paint color, that's not a renovation.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's redecoration.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
When you renovate, you have to use a hammer and saw and lots of tools.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Change a lot.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay, so the apartment was newly renovated and it was bright and airy.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Airy.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Airy.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Airy.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Alright, so airy, well I guess we understand the word air, right?

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So if an apartment or something is airy.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It has lots of space.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Lots of place to move around.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, so it's wide.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's open.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's open, okay.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
An open apartment.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Very good.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now for our next word, an important question she asked for the square footage.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Square footage.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The square footage of the apartment.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, so we know square foot, right?

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So feet like a measure of space.

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Right.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The square footage is just basically the area.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How big.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use these two words, square footage, in a sentence.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Example one.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
As a civil engineer, I have to calculate the square footage of the construction site.

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Example two.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Robert is worried that the square footage of this land is not big enough.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Example three.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you multiply the width of the room by the length, you will have the square footage of the room.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Those are some great examples and I find this, the ending of this word, is footage.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's interesting, isn't it?

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, I guess you can only use it with the imperial system.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So you can also say tonnage, right?

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So how, how big, how heavy or mileage mileage, right?

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But you can't say, for example, in meters, you wouldn't say meterage.

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No, you can't say that.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it's not for the metric system, it's only for some units of measurement in the imperial system.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Exactly.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Alright, so after we've measured the square footage of the apartment, we saw that they had new appliances.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Appliances.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Appliances.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Appliance.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, kitchen appliances, what are those?

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Machines that do stuff in the kitchen.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Alright, so a blender, a stove, a microwave, or I can say electric appliances.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So like your TV, an iron, a vacuum cleaner.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay, so appliance can be any type of machine that's used.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In a house.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
In a house.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And, well, one of these appliances was a professional grade gas range.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, this is a great phrase and I want to break it down.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So a gas range, now this is basically a stove that uses gas instead of electricity.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So I can have an electric range.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Now, professional grade, this is something that's really high quality.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So if it's high quality, why do we say it's professional grade?

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Because it's so good that professionals use it.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, so can I only have professional grade kitchen appliances?

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, of course not.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can have a professional grade anything, like a professional grade carpet, for example.

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, or a professional grade pickup truck.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Or you can even change this a little bit and say industrial grade.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So after we've seen all the appliances, they describe the house as spacious.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Spacious.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The house is very spacious.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Pretty easy, we know the word space here, right?

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So obviously this means lots of space.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It has lots of space.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So I guess maybe spacious and airy are a little bit similar, right?

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And of course, once we were in the master bedroom, we saw that they had a walk-in closet.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
A walk-in closet.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Walk-in closet.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A walk-in closet.

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right, so this is very easy.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I guess walk-in.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can walk into it.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right, and so it's a huge closet, right?

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yeah, now just a note on the spelling here, walk-in are hyphenated.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay, walk-in closet.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mm-hmm.

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Very good.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And apart from this beautiful closet, we had an en-suite bathroom.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
En-suite bathroom.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
En-suite bathroom.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
For another note on the spelling here, it's E-N hyphen S-U-I-T-E.

170
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So even though it's E-N, we pronounce it like an O-N.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yep.

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
En-suite.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So an en-suite bathroom is a bathroom inside the room.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, inside the master bedroom.

175
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Very good.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
En-suite bathroom.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So a lot of great words describing the apartment and also other aspects of real estate.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So why don't we listen to these one more time in context, and we'll see how they fit together to describe an apartment.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hi, we are the Christiansons.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We're here to see the apartment.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh, hi.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sure, come on in.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has done everything.

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It looks great.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's so bright and airy.

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What great light.

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I really love these hardwood floors.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's the square footage of this place?

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, it's about 120 square meters or 1300 square feet, more or less.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There's a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Really, at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I love it.

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But wait, what are the payment terms?

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
First and last month rent as deposit, and rent is due on the first of every month.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, it is.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Too good to be true.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It has a huge walk-in closet and an ensuite bathroom.

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We can't go in there yet, as the police...

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I mean, the clean-up crew hasn't finished yet.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What do you mean?

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's in here?

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Alright, so this is always kind of difficult to look for a new apartment and to go and see them, but it's interesting here, they were renting and they had a real estate agent.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yeah, and actually this is very uncommon in America, isn't it?

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I guess you don't really use a real estate agent unless you're going to buy a house or apartment.

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So when you're renting, you just go and look by yourself.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Right, you can find ads in the newspaper or on the internet and deal directly with the landlord.

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So after you've done your house hunting and found your apartment, you've got to set up the payment conditions.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like we saw in the dialogue, the payment terms were first and last month's rent as deposit.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So that's basically they'll keep that just in case you damage something in the apartment.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Or have a monster living in your bathroom.

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Exactly.

217
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And another thing is that I've noticed in some countries you pay rent in advance.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Right, so in America you only pay one month's rent at a time, right?

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Right.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So I guess this is an interesting topic, real estate and apartment hunting and renting is different in different countries.

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So that's where you guys need to come and tell us how does this work in your country?

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You can also use some of the vocabulary in this dialogue to tell us about your apartment.

223
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Right, how many rooms do you have, bedrooms, dining rooms?

224
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What's the square footage?

225
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Exactly.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Or how many square meters, right?

227
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Alright, and we'll see you guys there.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye!
