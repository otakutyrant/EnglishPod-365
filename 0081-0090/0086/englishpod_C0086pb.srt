00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,660
Hello English learners, welcome back to the EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,400
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,440
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,380
And today we have a special lesson for all of you who are looking for a new apartment or house.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,480
Or even if you're not looking for an apartment, this lesson will be useful because it can help you describe what your current apartment or house looks like.

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,239
That's right, so we're going to be describing an apartment, another vocabulary related to apartment hunting.

7
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,379
Why don't we take a look at some of the first words that we have in Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:30,859
Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,280
We're going to hear these two words in the dialogue.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,280
The first one is landlord.

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:38,759
Landlord.

12
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,539
Landlord.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,880
Alright, so who is a landlord or what is a landlord?

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,939
Well, it's pretty simple.

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,979
A landlord is the person who owns the house.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,759
Okay.

17
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,299
Or apartment.

18
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,560
So the owner of the house.

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,000
Right.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,000
And a landlord rents out the apartment to the tenants.

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,340
Okay, very good.

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,000
Tenants.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,640
Tenants.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,799
So the tenants are the people that are renting the apartment or house.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,299
Exactly.

26
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,980
Two important words that we'll find in the dialogue.

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,519
Tenants and landlord.

28
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,980
So why don't we take a listen to the dialogue now and we'll hear as a couple is checking out a new apartment.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,980
Hi, we are the Christiansons.

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,939
We're here to see the apartment.

31
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:23,819
Oh, hi.

32
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:24,299
Short.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,159
Come on in.

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,019
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,780
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has done everything.

36
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,640
It looks great.

37
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,760
It's so bright and airy.

38
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
What great light.

39
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,760
I really love these hardwood floors.

40
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,299
What's the square footage of this place?

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,439
Well, it's about 120 square meters or 1300 square feet, more or less.

42
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,480
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

43
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,640
There's a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range.

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,739
Really at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,760
I love it.

46
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:04,180
But wait, what are the payment terms?

47
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:10,139
First and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the first of every month.

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,439
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

49
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,819
Yes, it is.

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,180
Too good to be true.

51
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,719
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,580
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,159
It has a huge walk-in closet and an en suite bathroom.

54
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,419
We can't go in there yet as the police, uh, I mean, the cleanup crew hasn't finished yet.

55
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,300
Uh, what do you mean?

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,759
What's in here?

57
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,199
Oh, my God.

58
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:57,800
All right, so apparently the apartment was too good to be true.

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Yeah, I don't think that's exactly what they were expecting to find in the bathroom.

60
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,139
Exactly.

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,539
Well, we did find a lot of great words and phrases, so why don't we take a look at that now in Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:21,259
Language Takeaway We're just going to look at a bunch of vocabulary items related to apartments and house huntings.

63
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,400
So we've got a lot to cover here, so let's get started with the first one.

64
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:25,979
Renovated.

65
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,419
Renovated.

66
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,439
Renovated.

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,719
Right, so, and the apartment was newly renovated.

68
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:39,939
Okay, so the verb to renovate, a great word and I think some examples will help us understand the meaning.

69
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,099
Example one.

70
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,740
I had to renovate my kitchen because I accidentally burned everything while cooking.

71
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,800
Example two.

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,120
The city recently renovated the ceiling of the local church.

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,939
Example three.

74
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:12,020
John is planning on renovating his nightclub so as to make it more modern.

75
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,959
Okay, so basically to renovate means to make new again.

76
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,660
Right, when you renovate a house or an apartment, you take everything down and build it back up again.

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,399
Okay, so it's usually only used for buildings, for apartments, for houses.

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,319
Or offices.

79
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,459
You don't say you renovate your computer.

80
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,319
And also, when you just do something really simple like change the paint color, that's not a renovation.

81
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,060
That's redecoration.

82
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,319
When you renovate, you have to use a hammer and saw and lots of tools.

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,899
Change a lot.

84
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:52,959
Okay, so the apartment was newly renovated and it was bright and airy.

85
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,759
Airy.

86
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:54,860
Airy.

87
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:55,620
Airy.

88
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,120
Alright, so airy, well I guess we understand the word air, right?

89
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,000
So if an apartment or something is airy.

90
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,120
It has lots of space.

91
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,860
Lots of place to move around.

92
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,660
Okay, so it's wide.

93
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:07,740
It's open.

94
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,800
It's open, okay.

95
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,920
An open apartment.

96
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,100
Very good.

97
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,920
Now for our next word, an important question she asked for the square footage.

98
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,399
Square footage.

99
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,540
The square footage of the apartment.

100
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:24,259
Okay, so we know square foot, right?

101
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,560
So feet like a measure of space.

102
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,139
Right.

103
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,860
The square footage is just basically the area.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,439
How big.

105
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,379
Okay.

106
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:39,319
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use these two words, square footage, in a sentence.

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,480
Example one.

108
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:49,439
As a civil engineer, I have to calculate the square footage of the construction site.

109
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,639
Example two.

110
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,720
Robert is worried that the square footage of this land is not big enough.

111
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,240
Example three.

112
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,560
If you multiply the width of the room by the length, you will have the square footage of the room.

113
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:19,019
Those are some great examples and I find this, the ending of this word, is footage.

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,699
It's interesting, isn't it?

115
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,699
Yeah, I guess you can only use it with the imperial system.

116
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,839
So you can also say tonnage, right?

117
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,939
So how, how big, how heavy or mileage mileage, right?

118
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:36,779
But you can't say, for example, in meters, you wouldn't say meterage.

119
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,720
No, you can't say that.

120
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,800
So it's not for the metric system, it's only for some units of measurement in the imperial system.

121
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:44,660
Exactly.

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,279
Alright, so after we've measured the square footage of the apartment, we saw that they had new appliances.

123
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,620
Appliances.

124
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,019
Appliances.

125
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,060
Appliance.

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,120
So, kitchen appliances, what are those?

127
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,899
Machines that do stuff in the kitchen.

128
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:06,839
Alright, so a blender, a stove, a microwave, or I can say electric appliances.

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,720
So like your TV, an iron, a vacuum cleaner.

130
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,259
Okay, so appliance can be any type of machine that's used.

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,120
In a house.

132
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:16,620
In a house.

133
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:23,100
And, well, one of these appliances was a professional grade gas range.

134
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,899
Okay, this is a great phrase and I want to break it down.

135
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:34,160
So a gas range, now this is basically a stove that uses gas instead of electricity.

136
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,160
So I can have an electric range.

137
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,959
Now, professional grade, this is something that's really high quality.

138
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,660
So if it's high quality, why do we say it's professional grade?

139
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,339
Because it's so good that professionals use it.

140
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,959
Okay, so can I only have professional grade kitchen appliances?

141
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,000
No, of course not.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,319
You can have a professional grade anything, like a professional grade carpet, for example.

143
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,800
Okay, or a professional grade pickup truck.

144
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,779
Or you can even change this a little bit and say industrial grade.

145
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,779
So after we've seen all the appliances, they describe the house as spacious.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Spacious.

147
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,800
The house is very spacious.

148
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,420
Pretty easy, we know the word space here, right?

149
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,899
Right.

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,420
So obviously this means lots of space.

151
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:19,379
It has lots of space.

152
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,160
So I guess maybe spacious and airy are a little bit similar, right?

153
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:23,920
Okay.

154
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,680
And of course, once we were in the master bedroom, we saw that they had a walk-in closet.

155
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,440
A walk-in closet.

156
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,960
Walk-in closet.

157
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,940
A walk-in closet.

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
Right, so this is very easy.

159
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,100
I guess walk-in.

160
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,740
You can walk into it.

161
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,039
Right, and so it's a huge closet, right?

162
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,919
Yeah, now just a note on the spelling here, walk-in are hyphenated.

163
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:47,940
Okay, walk-in closet.

164
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,440
Mm-hmm.

165
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,379
Very good.

166
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,059
And apart from this beautiful closet, we had an en-suite bathroom.

167
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,360
En-suite bathroom.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,360
En-suite bathroom.

169
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,539
For another note on the spelling here, it's E-N hyphen S-U-I-T-E.

170
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,480
So even though it's E-N, we pronounce it like an O-N.

171
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:06,779
Yep.

172
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:07,759
En-suite.

173
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:11,379
So an en-suite bathroom is a bathroom inside the room.

174
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,200
Okay, inside the master bedroom.

175
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,320
Very good.

176
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,820
En-suite bathroom.

177
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,340
So a lot of great words describing the apartment and also other aspects of real estate.

178
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,080
So why don't we listen to these one more time in context, and we'll see how they fit together to describe an apartment.

179
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
Hi, we are the Christiansons.

180
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,360
We're here to see the apartment.

181
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,279
Oh, hi.

182
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,580
Sure, come on in.

183
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,440
Well, as you can see, the place has just been renovated.

184
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,220
The previous tenants left a huge mess here, so the landlord has done everything.

185
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,960
It looks great.

186
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,240
It's so bright and airy.

187
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,779
What great light.

188
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,299
I really love these hardwood floors.

189
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:57,700
What's the square footage of this place?

190
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:04,840
Well, it's about 120 square meters or 1300 square feet, more or less.

191
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,899
Oh, the landlord has also installed new kitchen appliances.

192
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,080
There's a new dishwasher and a professional grade gas range.

193
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,220
Really, at this price, this place is an amazing deal.

194
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,179
I love it.

195
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:18,580
But wait, what are the payment terms?

196
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,419
First and last month rent as deposit, and rent is due on the first of every month.

197
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,860
Considering the amount of money invested into the apartment, it's a very good deal.

198
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,320
Yes, it is.

199
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,639
Too good to be true.

200
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,159
The living room and dining room are quite spacious, as you can see.

201
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,000
And down this hall, here's the master bedroom.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,620
It has a huge walk-in closet and an ensuite bathroom.

203
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,620
We can't go in there yet, as the police...

204
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,879
I mean, the clean-up crew hasn't finished yet.

205
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,720
What do you mean?

206
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,279
What's in here?

207
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:13,059
Alright, so this is always kind of difficult to look for a new apartment and to go and see them, but it's interesting here, they were renting and they had a real estate agent.

208
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:18,200
Yeah, and actually this is very uncommon in America, isn't it?

209
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,519
I guess you don't really use a real estate agent unless you're going to buy a house or apartment.

210
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:26,039
So when you're renting, you just go and look by yourself.

211
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,120
Right, you can find ads in the newspaper or on the internet and deal directly with the landlord.

212
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,299
So after you've done your house hunting and found your apartment, you've got to set up the payment conditions.

213
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,139
Like we saw in the dialogue, the payment terms were first and last month's rent as deposit.

214
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,899
So that's basically they'll keep that just in case you damage something in the apartment.

215
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,720
Or have a monster living in your bathroom.

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,039
Exactly.

217
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,980
And another thing is that I've noticed in some countries you pay rent in advance.

218
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,740
Right, so in America you only pay one month's rent at a time, right?

219
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,200
Right.

220
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:09,039
So I guess this is an interesting topic, real estate and apartment hunting and renting is different in different countries.

221
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,940
So that's where you guys need to come and tell us how does this work in your country?

222
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,659
You can also use some of the vocabulary in this dialogue to tell us about your apartment.

223
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,580
Right, how many rooms do you have, bedrooms, dining rooms?

224
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,620
What's the square footage?

225
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:24,399
Exactly.

226
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,360
Or how many square meters, right?

227
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:29,759
So check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

228
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,360
Alright, and we'll see you guys there.

229
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,139
Thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye!
