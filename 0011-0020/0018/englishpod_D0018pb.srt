1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today with Erica, we have a very aggressive lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's true, we've got a revolutionary lesson.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, today at EnglishPod we're protesting.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So Erica, why don't you tell us what a protest is?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, when you protest something, you go into the streets and show your disagreement.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Right.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you yell and you have signs and everyone's just protesting.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And the news comes and if it's not clear now, it'll be clear after the dialogue, I'm sure.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Definitely, definitely.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So why don't we start with our vocabulary preview?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We have two words in our vocabulary preview today.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The first is bankrupt.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bankrupt.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Bankrupt.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bankrupt.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So if a company goes bankrupt, what happens?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It means the company doesn't have any more money.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So it can't pay salaries.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It can't pay anything.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It can't pay its bills, yeah.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So basically if it's bankrupt, it's probably going to close.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Exactly.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, our second word today is bailout.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Bailout.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Bailout.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Bailout.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
B-A-I-L.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Bailout.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So a bailout is when the government gives money to a company that is about to go bankrupt.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's true, it's emergency money that will help save the company.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well these two words are taken directly from our dialogue.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And in today's dialogue, we're going to bring you live to a newscast.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Right, so why don't we just listen to the dialogue?

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is Action 5 news reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
where a protest has broken out.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, 10 on 5 News, can you tell us what's happening?

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax dollars.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The U.S.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I see, but many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars and then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They're asking for money.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That is just not right.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Good point.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Right back to you, Tom.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Wow, these people are really angry.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think they're furious.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, I think they have some good points, and we'll talk about that later.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But now...

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's time for Language Takeaway.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Language Takeaway.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeah, there was some great language in this dialogue.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
A lot of language we use to express our anger.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Right.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And one of those words, and the first one for Language Takeaway, is injustice.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Injustice.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Injustice.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
An injustice.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So, an injustice is something that isn't fair.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's totally unfair.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's unfair, yeah.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is an injustice.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's look at our second word.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Outrage.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Outrage.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Outrage.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
An outrage.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So, Erika, why don't you give us an example on how you would use outrage.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There's no more coffee.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is an outrage.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, there we go.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's an outrage.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go to our next word now.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Breakout.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Breakout.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Breakout.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Breakout.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Breakout.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, we have some great examples on how we use breakout, so let's listen.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Example one.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
War is broken out in Antarctica as countries of the world fight for control of the icy continent.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Example two.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Officials are warning that fighting could break out in the border regions.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Example three.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A forest fire broke out last night.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, this is a wonderful phrasal verb that means...

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To begin suddenly.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, so I think that's pretty clear.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yep.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Breakout.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go to our next word now.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mismanaged.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mismanaged.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mismanaged.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, when something is mismanaged, it's...

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Not managed properly.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Managed poorly.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Poorly, right.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Our final word today is...

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Have the nerve to.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have the nerve to.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Have the nerve to.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think this one also is a little bit difficult to understand.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah, but we have some great examples prepared for you, so let's listen to them.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Example one.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been in love with you since the third grade, but I didn't have the love to tell you.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Example two.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't believe it.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You have the nerve to ask me for money when you know I've just lost my job.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Example three.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have the nerve to bring your new girlfriend to visit my mother.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So, have the nerve to is like, dare to do something, right?

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, how dare you.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah.

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Have the nerve to.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's like, I can't believe you would do that.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah, I think that's quite clear.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
A lot of great words in our dialogue today.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And also, we have some really interesting grammar in today's dialogue.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Right, so today, let's look at some grammar breakdown.

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Grammar breakdown.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In this section, grammar breakdown, we show you a particular grammar structure and explain a little bit about how that structure affects meaning.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So, it's not really about getting the grammar perfectly right, it's about understanding the meaning.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right, and in today's lesson, we saw some really great examples on how we use the present perfect tense.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's listen to an example from the dialogue.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Where a protest has broken out.

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where a protest has broken out.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
See the verb here, break out, like a protest has broken out, happened in the past, right?

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Right.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And it's still going on now.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, present perfect is used when we're talking about an event that happened in the past and is continuing on now.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Exactly.

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Or is continuing to affect now.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Exactly.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay, I think that's pretty clear.

153
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah, but now if you want to indicate or if you want to demonstrate that the action has finished, the event is over, then you would say it like this.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A protest broke out.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A protest broke out.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In this form, you see that the protest is over.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It happened yesterday already.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right, and I think it's really emphasizing the fact that it is no longer affecting the present moment.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Exactly.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So, remember, the difference between present perfect and simple past.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now, if you want to know more about these tenses, present perfect and simple past, be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
In the grammar section, you can find some more great examples and a really clear explanation on how these tenses are formed.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, 10-5 News.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Can you tell us what's happening?

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax dollars.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The U.S.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I see.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They're asking for money.

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That is just not right.

182
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Good point.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Back to you, Tom.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, Erica, so what do you think about this situation?

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
About the bailout of the auto industry.

187
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes.

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think it's a bad idea.

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why?

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
There's so many reasons.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean, I don't think it's fair for us as taxpayers.

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, I guess I'm not really an American taxpayer.

193
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But I don't think it's fair for the taxpayers to have to pay for the mismanagement of these companies.

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I mean, they've got so much debt, they've produced cars that nobody really wants to buy, and now they're in trouble.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And it's not our money that should be spent on saving them.

196
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, I would agree with you on that.

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But you do have to take into consideration the fact that if these companies go bankrupt, thousands of people will lose their jobs and not only the people that work at the factories, but also people that work for other companies that supply these factories.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, I mean, I see what you're saying, Marco, but at the same time, we can't support an industry that isn't working properly.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I mean, if one of these companies goes bankrupt, it's going to be terrible.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But it will force the other two companies perhaps to manage themselves better, to streamline and become more efficient.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I just think it will be better in the future.

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, it could be, but also maybe all three companies can go bankrupt.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It would be sad because the American car, the American auto industry is a symbol of prosperity.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's also the symbol of like the American culture in general.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I guess that's true.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So it would be a shame for it to go bankrupt because everyone owns a car in the United States, or most people.

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And it's just something that we can't lose.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But it is an interesting topic and we also want to know your opinions about it.

209
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, listeners, please come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us what you think about this bailout and about this lesson.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
On the website, we'll post a link to the news article where you can read a little bit more about this because this is actually going on now.

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's true.

212
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, everyone, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
