1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,360
Hello everyone, welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,360
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,400
And today with Erica, we have a very aggressive lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,259
That's true, we've got a revolutionary lesson.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,179
Yes, today at EnglishPod we're protesting.

6
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,839
So Erica, why don't you tell us what a protest is?

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,839
Well, when you protest something, you go into the streets and show your disagreement.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:27,940
Right.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,679
And you yell and you have signs and everyone's just protesting.

10
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:38,679
And the news comes and if it's not clear now, it'll be clear after the dialogue, I'm sure.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,020
Definitely, definitely.

12
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,020
So why don't we start with our vocabulary preview?

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,920
Vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,280
We have two words in our vocabulary preview today.

15
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,200
The first is bankrupt.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,320
Bankrupt.

17
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,100
Bankrupt.

18
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,380
Bankrupt.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,520
So if a company goes bankrupt, what happens?

20
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,380
It means the company doesn't have any more money.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
So it can't pay salaries.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,119
It can't pay anything.

23
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,159
It can't pay its bills, yeah.

24
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,700
So basically if it's bankrupt, it's probably going to close.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,420
Exactly.

26
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,439
Okay, our second word today is bailout.

27
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,700
Bailout.

28
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,760
Bailout.

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:14,819
Bailout.

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,939
B-A-I-L.

31
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:16,819
Bailout.

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,500
So a bailout is when the government gives money to a company that is about to go bankrupt.

33
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,219
That's true, it's emergency money that will help save the company.

34
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,900
Well these two words are taken directly from our dialogue.

35
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,700
And in today's dialogue, we're going to bring you live to a newscast.

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,480
Right, so why don't we just listen to the dialogue?

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,900
This is Action 5 news reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,859
where a protest has broken out.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,400
Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,359
Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, 10 on 5 News, can you tell us what's happening?

41
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,460
Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice.

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,599
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

43
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:20,060
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax dollars.

44
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:23,819
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

45
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,280
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

46
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,719
The U.S.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,020
government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

48
00:02:32,259 --> 00:02:36,099
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

49
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:43,560
I see, but many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,120
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

51
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:54,819
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars and then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets?

52
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:58,139
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,919
They're asking for money.

54
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,319
That is just not right.

55
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,300
Good point.

56
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,599
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

57
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,979
Right back to you, Tom.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
Wow, these people are really angry.

59
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:19,280
I think they're furious.

60
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,080
Well, I think they have some good points, and we'll talk about that later.

61
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,340
But now...

62
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,159
It's time for Language Takeaway.

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,199
Language Takeaway.

64
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,800
Yeah, there was some great language in this dialogue.

65
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,060
A lot of language we use to express our anger.

66
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,240
Right.

67
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:42,840
And one of those words, and the first one for Language Takeaway, is injustice.

68
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,340
Injustice.

69
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,719
Injustice.

70
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:47,460
An injustice.

71
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:51,360
So, an injustice is something that isn't fair.

72
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,840
It's totally unfair.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,139
It's unfair, yeah.

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,479
This is an injustice.

75
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,280
Let's look at our second word.

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,439
Outrage.

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,960
Outrage.

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,199
Outrage.

79
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,099
An outrage.

80
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,560
So, Erika, why don't you give us an example on how you would use outrage.

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,500
There's no more coffee.

82
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,099
This is an outrage.

83
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,599
Yeah, there we go.

84
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,659
That's an outrage.

85
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,680
Okay.

86
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,539
Let's go to our next word now.

87
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,420
Breakout.

88
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:17,800
Breakout.

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,000
Breakout.

90
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:19,819
Breakout.

91
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:20,620
Breakout.

92
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,120
So, we have some great examples on how we use breakout, so let's listen.

93
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,300
Example one.

94
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,480
War is broken out in Antarctica as countries of the world fight for control of the icy continent.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,879
Example two.

96
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,959
Officials are warning that fighting could break out in the border regions.

97
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,360
Example three.

98
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,759
A forest fire broke out last night.

99
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,220
Well, this is a wonderful phrasal verb that means...

100
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,079
To begin suddenly.

101
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,839
Okay, so I think that's pretty clear.

102
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,160
Yep.

103
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,639
Yeah.

104
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:12,120
Breakout.

105
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,860
Let's go to our next word now.

106
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,319
Mismanaged.

107
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:17,060
Mismanaged.

108
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,240
Mismanaged.

109
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,139
So, when something is mismanaged, it's...

110
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:22,439
Not managed properly.

111
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,420
Managed poorly.

112
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,439
Poorly, right.

113
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:24,839
Yeah.

114
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,420
Our final word today is...

115
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:28,899
Have the nerve to.

116
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,980
Have the nerve to.

117
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,959
Have the nerve to.

118
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
I think this one also is a little bit difficult to understand.

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,319
Yeah, but we have some great examples prepared for you, so let's listen to them.

120
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,439
Example one.

121
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720
I've been in love with you since the third grade, but I didn't have the love to tell you.

122
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,199
Example two.

123
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,220
I don't believe it.

124
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,720
You have the nerve to ask me for money when you know I've just lost my job.

125
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,620
Example three.

126
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,279
What?

127
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,439
You have the nerve to bring your new girlfriend to visit my mother.

128
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:28,699
So, have the nerve to is like, dare to do something, right?

129
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:29,680
Yeah, how dare you.

130
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,160
Yeah.

131
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:31,740
Have the nerve to.

132
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,060
It's like, I can't believe you would do that.

133
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,439
Yeah, I think that's quite clear.

134
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:36,759
Okay.

135
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,120
A lot of great words in our dialogue today.

136
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,480
And also, we have some really interesting grammar in today's dialogue.

137
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,079
Right, so today, let's look at some grammar breakdown.

138
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,120
Grammar breakdown.

139
00:06:52,340 --> 00:07:03,160
In this section, grammar breakdown, we show you a particular grammar structure and explain a little bit about how that structure affects meaning.

140
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,120
So, it's not really about getting the grammar perfectly right, it's about understanding the meaning.

141
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,879
Right, and in today's lesson, we saw some really great examples on how we use the present perfect tense.

142
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,819
Let's listen to an example from the dialogue.

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
Where a protest has broken out.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,959
Where a protest has broken out.

145
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,339
See the verb here, break out, like a protest has broken out, happened in the past, right?

146
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:33,879
Right.

147
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,939
And it's still going on now.

148
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,180
So, present perfect is used when we're talking about an event that happened in the past and is continuing on now.

149
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:44,860
Exactly.

150
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,319
Or is continuing to affect now.

151
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:48,319
Exactly.

152
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,100
Okay, I think that's pretty clear.

153
00:07:50,100 --> 00:08:00,459
Yeah, but now if you want to indicate or if you want to demonstrate that the action has finished, the event is over, then you would say it like this.

154
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,200
A protest broke out.

155
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,959
A protest broke out.

156
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,579
In this form, you see that the protest is over.

157
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:14,079
It happened yesterday already.

158
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,220
Right, and I think it's really emphasizing the fact that it is no longer affecting the present moment.

159
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:20,980
Exactly.

160
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:25,779
So, remember, the difference between present perfect and simple past.

161
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:33,480
Now, if you want to know more about these tenses, present perfect and simple past, be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com.

162
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:40,200
In the grammar section, you can find some more great examples and a really clear explanation on how these tenses are formed.

163
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,100
But now we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

164
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,940
Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, 10-5 News.

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Can you tell us what's happening?

166
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:20,799
Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice.

167
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,960
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

168
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,399
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax dollars.

169
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:33,179
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

170
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:35,639
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

171
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,080
The U.S.

172
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,360
government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

173
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,480
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

174
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,679
I see.

175
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,919
But many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.

176
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,480
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

177
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,000
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars?

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,200
And then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets.

179
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,480
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

180
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,279
They're asking for money.

181
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,700
That is just not right.

182
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:11,639
Good point.

183
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,960
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

184
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:16,340
Back to you, Tom.

185
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,940
Okay, Erica, so what do you think about this situation?

186
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,419
About the bailout of the auto industry.

187
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:29,720
Yes.

188
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,639
I think it's a bad idea.

189
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,360
Why?

190
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,840
There's so many reasons.

191
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,820
I mean, I don't think it's fair for us as taxpayers.

192
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,159
Well, I guess I'm not really an American taxpayer.

193
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:46,500
But I don't think it's fair for the taxpayers to have to pay for the mismanagement of these companies.

194
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,759
I mean, they've got so much debt, they've produced cars that nobody really wants to buy, and now they're in trouble.

195
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,299
And it's not our money that should be spent on saving them.

196
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:57,379
Yeah, I would agree with you on that.

197
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:13,000
But you do have to take into consideration the fact that if these companies go bankrupt, thousands of people will lose their jobs and not only the people that work at the factories, but also people that work for other companies that supply these factories.

198
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:20,179
Yeah, I mean, I see what you're saying, Marco, but at the same time, we can't support an industry that isn't working properly.

199
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,299
I mean, if one of these companies goes bankrupt, it's going to be terrible.

200
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:31,419
But it will force the other two companies perhaps to manage themselves better, to streamline and become more efficient.

201
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,179
I just think it will be better in the future.

202
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,279
Well, it could be, but also maybe all three companies can go bankrupt.

203
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:44,409
It would be sad because the American car, the American auto industry is a symbol of prosperity.

204
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,980
It's also the symbol of like the American culture in general.

205
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,340
I guess that's true.

206
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:57,820
So it would be a shame for it to go bankrupt because everyone owns a car in the United States, or most people.

207
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,700
And it's just something that we can't lose.

208
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,559
But it is an interesting topic and we also want to know your opinions about it.

209
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:12,539
Yeah, listeners, please come to our website at EnglishPod.com and tell us what you think about this bailout and about this lesson.

210
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,080
On the website, we'll post a link to the news article where you can read a little bit more about this because this is actually going on now.

211
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,940
That's true.

212
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,940
Well, everyone, thanks for listening and until next time, goodbye.
