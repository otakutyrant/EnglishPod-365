00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,979
EnglishPod.com Yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice.

2
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:37,100
The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop.

3
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,560
We're here to show the government that we don't like the way they're spending our tax dollars.

4
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,320
Sir, but what exactly is making everyone so angry?

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,780
It's an absolute outrage, Sarah.

6
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,240
The U.S.

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,520
government wants to give $25 billion of taxpayers' money to the auto industry.

8
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,619
These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.

9
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:58,799
I see.

10
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:05,120
But many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.

11
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,620
That may be true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job.

12
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,340
But how can these CEOs ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars, and then they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets?

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,640
This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,420
They're asking for money.

15
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,819
That is just not right.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,799
Good point.

17
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,120
This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D.C.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,359
Back to you, Tom.
