00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com I hate working on Christmas Eve.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Come in Central.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think we got ourselves a situation here.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
License and registration, please.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Step out of the vehicle, please.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Sir, what do you have in the back?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Just a few Christmas gifts.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Tis the season, after all.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't take that tone with me.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Do you have an invoice for these items?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, no.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You are under arrest, sir.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You have the right to remain silent.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You better not pout.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You better not cry.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You have the right to an attorney.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you can't afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You can't take me to jail.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What about my sleigh?

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's Christmas Eve.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have presents to deliver.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Rudolph, Prancer, Dancer, get help!
