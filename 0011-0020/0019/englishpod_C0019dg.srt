00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:11,980
EnglishPod.com I hate working on Christmas Eve.

2
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,480
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:16,559
Come in Central.

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:18,359
I think we got ourselves a situation here.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,799
License and registration, please.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,200
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

7
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:42,119
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,119
Step out of the vehicle, please.

9
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,060
Sir, what do you have in the back?

10
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,000
Just a few Christmas gifts.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,939
Tis the season, after all.

12
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,500
Don't take that tone with me.

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,500
Do you have an invoice for these items?

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,500
Oh, no.

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,259
I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

16
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:02,259
You are under arrest, sir.

17
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,960
You have the right to remain silent.

18
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,079
You better not pout.

19
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,060
You better not cry.

20
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,099
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

21
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,319
You have the right to an attorney.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,040
If you can't afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,299
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
You can't take me to jail.

25
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,379
What about my sleigh?

26
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,579
It's Christmas Eve.

27
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,359
I have presents to deliver.

28
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:25,659
Rudolph, Prancer, Dancer, get help!
