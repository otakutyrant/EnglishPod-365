00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners and welcome to another lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're bringing you a great Christmas lesson.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right, we've got a lot of Christmas vocabulary in today's lesson for you.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, it's almost Christmas time so everyone is getting into the spirit, especially here at EnglishPod.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're going to teach you a little bit more about this.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Speaking of the spirit, I think it's time for us to look at our vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Vocabulary Preview So in this part of our show we'll look at some key language in the dialogue that you'll need to know to understand the dialogue.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And actually today we only have one word.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Eggnog.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Eggnog.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Eggnog.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
E-G-G-N-O-G.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Eggnog.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So eggnog is a really popular Christmas drink.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a traditional Christmas drink.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Right.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What is it made of?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Eggs, cream, sugar, and usually rum.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Rum, oh so it has alcohol.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yep, normally it has alcohol.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay, alright, that's interesting.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's actually a drink very similar to this in Chile.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Really?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yep, they call it monkey tail.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So in Spanish that would be?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Cola de mono.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Very nice.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yeah, so it's actually really, really good, and it's really similar to eggnog.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay, well with that in mind, let's take a listen to our dialogue for the first time.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I hate working on Christmas Eve.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come in Central, I think we got ourselves a situation here.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
License and registration, please.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Step out of the vehicle, please.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Sir, what do you have in the back?

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just a few Christmas gifts.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Tis the season, after all.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't take that tone with me.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you have an invoice for these items?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh no, I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are under arrest, sir.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You have the right to remain silent.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You better not pout.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You better not cry.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You have the right to an attorney.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you can't afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You can't take me to jail.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What about my sleigh?

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's Christmas Eve.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have presents to deliver.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Rudolph, Prancer, Dancer, good help!

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, I did not see that one coming.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah, that was interesting.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Santa Claus is being taken to jail.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's going to happen next, Marco?

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We'll talk about that in a little while.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's take a look at some language from this dialogue.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Language takeaway.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So the first word that we have on our language takeaway today is vehicle.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Vehicle.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Vehicle.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Vehicle.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, this is a vehicle.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Vehicle.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And this is a vehicle.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And this is a vehicle.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, all of those are vehicles.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now, I thought that a vehicle was a car specifically.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No, any machine that carries people from one place to another is a vehicle.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Great.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's take a look now at our second word, attorney.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Attorney.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So, what is an attorney?

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A lawyer.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, that's simple enough.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, a lawyer.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's move to our third word, which is...

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Appoint.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Appoint.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Appoint.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Appoint.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So, appoint means choose.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay, so the president of a country might appoint his chief of staff.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right, or I can appoint my attorney.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
True.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, can you appoint a thing?

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can I appoint my coffee cup?

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
No, no.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You only use it for people.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You choose someone.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can choose something.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So, I appoint someone.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Exactly.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
All right.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's move to our final word.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Slay.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Slay.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Slay.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Slay.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, Erica, you're from Canada.

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can tell us about sleighs.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
All right.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A sleigh is a vehicle that is pulled by a horse and travels over snow or ice.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, you know, like Santa drives a sleigh.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He drives a sleigh.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So, do you drive a sleigh or ride a sleigh?

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Good question.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, the song says you ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, you know what?

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think it's time for us to look at some interesting phrases that we found in this dialogue.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, let's look at putting it together.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Putting it together.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Today on putting it together, we have two great phrases for you.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And let's take a look at the first one.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Step out.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Step out.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Step out.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So, step out means to go out of a place for a short period of time.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Right.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So, in our dialogue, for example, the police officer said step out of the vehicle.

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Get out of your vehicle.

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You can also say step out of the office.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You can say I just stepped out of the shower.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Right.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now, we can also say step in.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's the opposite.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The opposite, right?

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can ask Marco step into my office for a moment.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Uh-oh.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So, that's step out and step in.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Great phrases.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's take a look at our final phrase.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Get a load of.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Get a load of.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Get a load of.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So, when I say get a load of something, I mean look at, right?

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Right.

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Look at this guy.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Get a load of this guy.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's what we heard in the dialogue.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, you can use this phrase in a number of different ways and we have some examples for you.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Example one.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Get a load of this.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A war has started in Antarctica.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Example two.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Get a load of that house.

159
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's so big.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Example three.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Get a load of him.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He's wearing a pink suit.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think we've covered a lot of interesting words and phrases.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, we are ready to listen to our dialogue a second time.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But this time it's going to be a little bit slower so we can pick up all these great words.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I hate working on Christmas Eve.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Whoa.

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Get a load of this guy.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Come in central.

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I think we got ourselves a situation here.

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
License and registration, please.

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Step out of the vehicle, please.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Sir, what do you have in the back?

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Just a few Christmas gifts.

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Tis the season after all.

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't take that tone with me.

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you have an invoice for these items?

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Um, no.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You are under arrest, sir.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You have the right to remain silent.

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You better not pout.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You better not cry.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have the right to an attorney.

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you cannot afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you understand all these rights that have just been read to you?

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't take me to jail.

192
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What about my sleigh?

193
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's Christmas Eve.

194
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have presents to deliver.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Rudolph, Prancer, Dancer, get help.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, so we noticed some really great words and phrases, and with this, now we can start with some fluency builder.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Fluency builder.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Today on Fluency Builder, we have two great phrases that you can use to sound a little bit more natural when you speak.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Our first phrase you can use if you want to say, don't speak to me like that.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't take that tone with me.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't take that tone with me.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you often hear this phrase coming out of the mouth of a mother or a father.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, when their children are maybe talking back.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't take that tone with me, young man.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I used to get that a lot.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Really?

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sorry about that.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, our second phrase, we use it when we have a problem.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The phrase we heard in the dialogue was, I think we've got ourselves a situation here.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's listen to another example.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Houston, we've got ourselves a situation here.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Houston, we've got ourselves a situation here.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sometimes I use this phrase when I want to tell my boss that I have a problem.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I might say, boss, I've got a bit of a situation, can you help me with it?

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay, yeah, I have a little bit of a problem.

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, useful phrases, hey?

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Really useful phrases, great stuff.

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So now we can listen to our dialogue a final time, and this time we can understand everything that's in it.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I hate working on Christmas Eve.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Whoa, get a load of this guy.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Come in Central, I think we've got ourselves a situation here.

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
License and registration, please.

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Have you been drinking tonight, sir?

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I had one or two glasses of eggnog, but nothing else.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Step out of the vehicle, please.

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sir, what do you have in the back?

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Just a few Christmas gifts.

229
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Tis the season, after all.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't take that tone with me.

231
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you have an invoice for these items?

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, no, I make these in my workshop in the North Pole.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You are under arrest, sir.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You have the right to remain silent.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You better not pout, you better not cry.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You have the right to an attorney, if you can't afford one, the state will appoint one for you.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you understand these rights that have just been read to you?

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can't take me to jail?

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What about my sleigh?

241
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's Christmas Eve, I have presents to deliver.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Rudolph, Prancer, Dancer, get help!

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's coming straight to the ghetto.

244
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So, when the police officer was arresting Santa Claus, he said something a little bit strange, hey?

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, he said, you better not pout, you better not cry.

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now, are those part of the normal rights that a police officer reads?

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No, no, they're not part of the normal rights.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's actually from a Christmas song, so let's listen to how it goes in the song.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You better watch out, you better not cry.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You better not pout, I'm telling you why.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Santa Claus is coming to town.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm pretty happy we had a song to play there instead of us having to sing.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But that's great, because if the children cry or if they are not good kids, then Santa Claus will not give them presents.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So, that's why.

255
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Okay, listeners, I hope that you're not pouting, I hope you're not crying, but it's time for us to go, so...

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com, and be sure to leave all your questions and comments, and maybe some of your Christmas stories.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Alright, thanks for listening, and until next time, goodbye.
