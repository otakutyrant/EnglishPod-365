EnglishPod.com Whoa!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's going on?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Watch out!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Watch where you're going!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh no!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm so sorry!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you alright?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I feel terrible.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I really didn't mean to knock you over.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Really, it was an accident.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Please accept my apologies.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Just let me try to stand up.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why do birds suddenly appear?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, wait a second.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You seem really familiar.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think I know you from somewhere.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, that's right.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think we've met somewhere before.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We met at Aaron's place last weekend.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What a coincidence.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I've got a nine o'clock meeting.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But here's my number.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ouch!

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
My ankle!

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think it's broken.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You can't just leave me like this.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you calling an ambulance?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nope.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you remember when we met?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Last day, I knew you were my friend.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to tell you how much I love you.
