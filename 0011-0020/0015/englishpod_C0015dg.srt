EnglishPod.com Whoa!

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,339
What's going on?

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,140
Watch out!

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,940
Hey!

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,420
Watch where you're going!

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,280
Oh no!

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,339
I'm so sorry!

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,140
Are you alright?

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,179
I don't know.

10
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,519
I feel terrible.

11
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:27,600
I really didn't mean to knock you over.

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,000
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,260
Really, it was an accident.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,880
Please accept my apologies.

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,380
Just let me try to stand up.

16
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:50,460
Why do birds suddenly appear?

17
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,960
Oh, wait a second.

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,619
You seem really familiar.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,460
I think I know you from somewhere.

20
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,039
Yeah, that's right.

21
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,439
I think we've met somewhere before.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,519
We met at Aaron's place last weekend.

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,920
What a coincidence.

24
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:11,319
But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,519
I've got a nine o'clock meeting.

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:14,780
But here's my number.

27
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:16,859
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

28
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:17,599
Ouch!

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:18,700
My ankle!

30
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:19,900
I think it's broken.

31
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,140
You can't just leave me like this.

32
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,340
Are you calling an ambulance?

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,519
Nope.

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,420
I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

35
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,299
Do you remember when we met?

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,019
Last day, I knew you were my friend.

37
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:52,379
I want to tell you how much I love you.
