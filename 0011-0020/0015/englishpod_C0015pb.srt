00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to another great lesson with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Erika, today we have a great intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right, we've got a lesson about love.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
About love.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And about apologizing.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ah, okay.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Love and apologizing.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
They go together.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, they do, especially if you have a girlfriend or boyfriend, right?

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's true.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, so why don't we start by looking at our vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In today's vocabulary preview, we will learn two important words from our dialogue.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What's the first word?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Knock over.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Knock over.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Knock over.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Knock over.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So that's a really simple one.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
When you knock something over.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You make it fall down.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Make it fall down.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yep.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Speaking of knocking things over, this morning I knocked over my coffee cup all over my desk.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, I saw that.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You almost ruined our lesson plan for today.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, I did.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was all over the place.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, let's look at our second word.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Explode.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Explode.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Explode.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Explode.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, when something explodes, this is what happens.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
All right, that's pretty clear.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's more than clear, I think.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So now we've looked at our two vocabulary preview words for this dialogue, and we are ready to listen to it for the first time.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Watch out!

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ahh!

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hey, watch where you're going.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you all right?

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I feel terrible.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I really didn't mean to knock you over.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Really it was an accident.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please accept my apologies.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just let me try to stand up.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh, wait a second.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You seem really familiar.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think I know you from somewhere.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, that's right.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think we've met somewhere before.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We met at Erin's place last weekend.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What a coincidence.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt, and I should probably get going.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've got a nine o'clock meeting.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But here's my number.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ouch!

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My ankle.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I think it's broken.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can't just leave me like this.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you calling an ambulance?

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Nope.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I love happy endings.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Such a romantic dialogue.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yeah, this guy.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh my god, he is amazing.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I would love to meet a guy like that.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Like that?

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Like crashing into you?

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Maybe not like that.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, well I think it's time to look at some of the language in this dialogue.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's start with our language takeaway.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Today we have three important words from our dialogue that we will learn for our language takeaway.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The first word is familiar.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Familiar.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Familiar.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Familiar.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This one I think is a little bit hard to explain.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yeah, so let's listen to some examples on how we use familiar.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I have no idea.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Nothing looks familiar.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think we're lost.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Example three.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You look really familiar.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Did we go to high school together?

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So when something's familiar, you think you know it, but you're not exactly sure.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Exactly.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Familiar.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Our next word is place.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Aaron's place.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Exactly.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So when we refer to place, we refer to house.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So I can say, hey Marco, come over to my place for dinner tonight.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Exactly.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Or I could say, we're having a party at my place tonight at eight.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You might ask someone, how's your new place?

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How's your new apartment?

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Exactly.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's a good one.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So place.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's a house.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Right.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Our final word today is coincidence.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Coincidence.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Coincidence.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So again, we have some great examples for you to understand how we use coincidence.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Example one.

117
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm going to New York this weekend.

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What a coincidence.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I am too.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Example two.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
By coincidence, everyone in the room was named Alex.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Example six.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Example three.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We met by pure coincidence.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
One day we ran into each other on our bikes and we've been together ever since.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A coincidence is something that happens by chance, right?

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Right.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You didn't plan it.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It just happened.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
These funny little things happen all the time.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I love it when these coincidences happen.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, they're great.

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So Erica, why don't you tell us about a coincidence that's happened to you?

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, the other night I was having dinner in a restaurant and I looked up and I saw my old professor from university.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It was such a coincidence because here we are in Shanghai and I see my professor from Canada having dinner at the table next to me.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It was such a coincidence.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That is a coincidence.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Or has it ever happened to you that you're thinking of someone and that person calls you?

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That happens all the time.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's a coincidence.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, yeah.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, so now that we have learned these three language takeaway words, we can listen to our dialogue a second time, but this time it's going to be slower.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, watch where you're going.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you all right?

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh, I don't know.

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I feel terrible.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I didn't mean to knock you over.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Really, it was an accident.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Please accept my apologies.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Just let me try to stand up.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh, wait a second.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You seem really familiar.

156
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I think I know you from somewhere.

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah, I think we have met somewhere before.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's right, we met at Aaron's place last weekend.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What a coincidence.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But anyway, I'm glad to see that you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have a nine o'clock meeting.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But here's my number.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Ouch, my ankle.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I think it's broken.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You can't just leave me like this.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you calling an ambulance?

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, that was much clearer, wasn't it?

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes, that was clearer and this brings us to Fluency Builder.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Fluency Builder.

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In today's Fluency Builder, we're going to show you different ways of apologizing.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's so important to be able to apologize well and fluently.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Exactly, and you also want to say something different from I'm sorry.

175
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Right.

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So that's what we're going to show you today.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We heard some great expressions for I'm sorry in the dialogue.

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's listen now.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm so sorry.

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I feel terrible.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Please accept my apologies.

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, I feel terrible.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I say this one all the time.

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yeah, it's a great way of saying I'm sorry.

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Now, also, if you want to say I'm sorry, you also want to tell the person that you made a mistake, right?

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's true.

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And we did hear some wonderful expressions for I made a mistake in this dialogue.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I didn't mean to knock you over.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was a mistake.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was an accident.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I didn't mean to knock you over.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It was an accident.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, I didn't mean to knock my coffee cup over this morning.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Exactly.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was an accident.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Not on purpose, right?

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Or so you think.

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So all of these phrases are really useful and great for apologizing and telling someone you made a mistake.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, it's time for us to listen to our dialogue a third time.

202
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This time it'll be at its normal speed and I think you'll be able to understand a little bit better.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Watch out!

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ahhh!

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey, watch where you're going.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh no, I'm so sorry.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you alright?

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I feel terrible.

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I really didn't mean to knock you over.

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My tire just exploded and I lost control of my bike.

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Really, it was an accident.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please accept my apologies.

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Just let me try to stand up.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Every time you want me Oh, wait a second.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You seem really familiar.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I think I know you from somewhere.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, that's right.

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think we've met somewhere before.

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We met at Erin's place last weekend.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What a coincidence.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But anyway, I'm glad to see you're not badly hurt and I should probably get going.

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I've got a nine o'clock meeting.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But here's my number.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Call me and we'll exchange insurance information.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Ouch!

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
My ankle!

229
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I think it's broken.

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can't just leave me like this.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Are you calling an ambulance?

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Nope.

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm canceling my appointment so that I can stay here with you.

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Great dialogue and great music, right?

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Wonderful music.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Who picked that, Marco?

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Of course, me.

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm a romantic type.

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I love romantic music.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes.

241
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, speaking of a romantic type, do you believe in love at first sight?

242
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I kind of do.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Really?

244
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'd like to believe it.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, well...

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It surprises me.

247
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, I think the first time that you see someone, it impresses you some way.

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And you feel attracted to that person.

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Really?

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
At least it's the first feeling that you get that makes you want to talk to that person or get to know that person.

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm the exact opposite.

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When I see somebody for the first time, my first impression is always wrong.

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So if I see someone and I like them at the beginning, in three weeks I'll hate them.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And if I see someone and I don't like them when I first meet them, I'll be their best friend.

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So love at first sight doesn't work for me.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sure that our listeners have some stories of love at first sight.

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Maybe they've met their wives or their boyfriends in this way.

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'd like to hear about it.

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Me too.

261
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And if anybody knows the name of the songs we used, also be sure to post it on the discussion board.

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's right.

263
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Our challenge for this week.

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Our challenge for this lesson.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So that's all for today, everyone.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But be sure to go to our website at EnglishPod.com.

267
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And as we said, leave all your comments, your stories, and see if you know the name of the songs.

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Well, thanks for listening, everyone.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And until next time, goodbye.
