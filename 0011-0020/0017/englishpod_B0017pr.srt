00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to another episode of EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today with Erica, we are getting married.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, we're not getting married.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're not, but our actors in the podcast are.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So we've got a lesson today about weddings.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And you know what?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
A lot of the language in this lesson is about weddings and marriages.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And maybe you don't need to use this language every day, but.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Learning this vocabulary will definitely help you understand or learn a lot more about Anglo culture.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, great point, Marco.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I think now we can look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So two simple words in this vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The first one is groom.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Groom.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Groom.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Groom.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Groom.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And the second word is the groom.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Is the man.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The man that's getting married.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And our second word is.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Bride.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Bride.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Bride.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And obviously the bride is?

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The woman getting married.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Perfect.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Now we have our bride and our groom.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it's time to listen to our dialogue the first time.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, well, it's about time.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't be mean.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, their dresses look beautiful.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's the flower girl and the ring bearer.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, they look so cute.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm starving.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I hope the food's good at the reception.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's all you ever think about.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Food.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, she looks gorgeous.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait, what's she doing?

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where is she going?

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, great.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, Marco, that's so sad.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, I know.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The reception is canceled.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Marco, they're not getting married.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, well, I mean, the best part is when you go and eat and drink at the reception.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Well, there's some great language in this dialogue.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And now let's look at our language takeaway.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Language takeaway.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Great.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Our first word on the language takeaway today is it's about time.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's about time.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's about time.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's about time.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So now we are going to listen to some examples on how we use this great phrase.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Example one.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Dinner's ready.

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's about time.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm starving.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Example two.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Guess what?

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I finally got a job.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's about time.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You've been unemployed for two years.

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Example three.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're almost there.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Just a couple more minutes.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's about time.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We've been driving for 12 hours.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So this phrase means finally.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Finally, at last.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We've been waiting a long time for this.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it's about time.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Great.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's take a look at our second word now.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A-I-S-L-E.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Aisle.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a tricky word.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It sounds like the contraction of I will.

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yeah, but it's spelled so strangely.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Right.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We don't pronounce the S.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The S is silent.

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's true.

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Aisle.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So what is an aisle?

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In a big room, where you have a lot of chairs, that space in the middle that allows people to walk through, that's the aisle.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So the aisle is the part where you walk.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In a big room.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In a big room.

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
With many chairs.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
With many chairs.

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So in the church.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The bride and groom.

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Walked on the aisle.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Exactly.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Great.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's move to our third word.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Bridesmaid.

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Bridesmaid.

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bridesmaid.

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So who are the bridesmaids?

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or wait, maybe you should ask me that.

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, because we don't get bridesmaids.

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, so the bridesmaids are the women who are friends of the bride who stand next to her when she's getting married.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Usually they're her best friends.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, so we have our bridesmaids.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now we have our flower girl.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Flower girl.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Flower girl.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Again, I'll explain this one.

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Please, please.

134
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The flower girl is that cute little girl who walks down the aisle and who throws flowers.

135
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's the flower girl.

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And with the flower girl, we have our ring bearer.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Ring bearer.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ring bearer.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So the ring bearer is the cute little boy who walks down the aisle carrying the rings.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yep.

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, so a lot of useful vocabulary for a wedding ceremony.

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's true.

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now let's look at our last word.

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Gorgeous.

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Gorgeous.

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Gorgeous.

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Gorgeous means beautiful.

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Very beautiful.

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You know, beautiful you can only use with a woman.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Can you use gorgeous with a woman or with a man?

151
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, gorgeous is unisex.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So both men and women are gorgeous.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right, you can say, oh, that girl is gorgeous.

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That guy is gorgeous.

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Right.

156
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Or you can say even this house is gorgeous.

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, so men, women, objects.

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes, yes.

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
All right.

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, we've learned some really interesting vocabulary that will help us to understand an Anglo wedding.

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue slowed down?

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, well, it's about time.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

165
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't be mean.

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Their dresses look beautiful.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's the flower girl and the ring bearer.

170
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, they look so cute.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm starving.

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I hope the food's good at the reception.

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's all you ever think about food.

176
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
She looks gorgeous.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Wait, what's she doing?

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where's she going?

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, great.

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now in this dialogue, we have a word that many students often make mistakes on.

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So this is a word that causes a lot of problems.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, the word marry.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Marry.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Marry, right?

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So we are going to listen now to some common mistakes on how English learners use this word.

188
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Right, so these are wrong examples.

189
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Example one.

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Honey, let's marry.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Example two.

192
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We married four years ago.

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Example three.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When I marry, I want a huge wedding.

195
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
These are great examples of mistakes students make with the word marry.

196
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They're missing a word.

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's listen to these right examples to see what word is missing.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Example one.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Honey, let's get married.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Example two.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We got married four years ago.

202
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Example three.

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When I get married, I want a huge wedding.

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Great, so we can see that when we use the word marry, we say to get married.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Exactly right.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Get married.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
To get married, right?

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, don't forget that.

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Get married.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I will get married.

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We got married.

213
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So now you know exactly how to use this word.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
We are ready to listen to our dialogue again for a third time, and this time it's going to be at a normal speed.

215
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

216
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, well, it's about time.

217
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't be mean.

219
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

220
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Their dresses look beautiful.

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

222
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's the flower girl and the rainbearer.

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew.

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, they look so cute.

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm starving.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I hope the food's good at the reception.

228
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's all you ever think about.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Food.

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
She looks gorgeous.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wait, what's she doing?

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where is she going?

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Oh, great.

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, well, I'm going to be honest with you.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know too much about marriages because, first of all, I'm not married, and I've never really been to many marriages.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So, Erika, some questions for you.

239
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Okay.

240
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What are these bridesmaids doing?

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are they about?

242
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do the bridesmaids do?

243
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, what are they doing there?

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, like I said earlier, the bridesmaids are the friends of the bride.

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But the most important people, besides the bride and groom, are the best man and the maid of honor.

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, and what do they do there in the ceremony?

247
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Well, what they do is they sign the marriage license.

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

249
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So they're like witnesses.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Exactly.

251
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay.

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, but wait a minute.

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They sign the marriage license there in the church?

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah, of course.

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Right inside the church, you sign the marriage license.

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Wow, that's strange because from what I know, in other countries, usually you will sign the marriage license before the ceremony.

257
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So you get married twice.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, you have like the civil marriage and then you have like the church wedding or whatever.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's so complicated.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well, yeah, I mean, the church wedding is just a ceremony.

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's not really anything official.

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, in Canada, it's the official part as well.

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I guess maybe you're just more efficient.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Maybe.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, this is a really fascinating, a really interesting subject, isn't it?

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yeah, because there's so many countries that have different marriage ceremonies.

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know that marriages in India lasts around seven days.

268
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
