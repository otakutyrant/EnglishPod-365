00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to another episode of EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,339
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,419
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:10,859
And today with Erica, we are getting married.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:13,119
Well, we're not getting married.

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,039
We're not, but our actors in the podcast are.

7
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:17,760
That's right.

8
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:21,120
So we've got a lesson today about weddings.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,920
And you know what?

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,500
A lot of the language in this lesson is about weddings and marriages.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,520
And maybe you don't need to use this language every day, but.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,119
Learning this vocabulary will definitely help you understand or learn a lot more about Anglo culture.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,359
Okay, great point, Marco.

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,740
I think now we can look at our vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,060
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,960
So two simple words in this vocabulary preview.

17
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,939
The first one is groom.

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,039
Groom.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,119
Groom.

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,100
Groom.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,259
Groom.

22
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,000
And the second word is the groom.

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,380
Is the man.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,719
The man that's getting married.

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,259
Okay.

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,439
And our second word is.

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,319
Bride.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,260
Bride.

29
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,260
Bride.

30
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:09,340
And obviously the bride is?

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,760
The woman getting married.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,280
Perfect.

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,840
Now we have our bride and our groom.

34
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,560
So it's time to listen to our dialogue the first time.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,739
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

36
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah, well, it's about time.

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,439
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

38
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,659
Don't be mean.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,260
Oh, their dresses look beautiful.

41
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,340
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

42
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,739
That's the flower girl and the ring bearer.

43
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew.

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,340
Oh, they look so cute.

45
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,420
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,180
I'm starving.

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,180
I hope the food's good at the reception.

48
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,099
That's all you ever think about.

49
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:57,579
Food.

50
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,620
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

51
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,180
Oh, she looks gorgeous.

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,379
Wait, what's she doing?

53
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:07,700
Where is she going?

54
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,860
Oh, great.

55
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,919
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

56
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,819
Oh, Marco, that's so sad.

57
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,360
Yeah, I know.

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,939
The reception is canceled.

59
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,639
Marco, they're not getting married.

60
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,259
Oh, well, I mean, the best part is when you go and eat and drink at the reception.

61
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:28,879
Okay.

62
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,020
Well, there's some great language in this dialogue.

63
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,080
And now let's look at our language takeaway.

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,800
Language takeaway.

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,439
Great.

66
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,919
Our first word on the language takeaway today is it's about time.

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,319
It's about time.

68
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:48,879
It's about time.

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,939
It's about time.

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,680
So now we are going to listen to some examples on how we use this great phrase.

71
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:58,819
Example one.

72
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,360
Dinner's ready.

73
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:03,719
It's about time.

74
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,659
I'm starving.

75
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,060
Example two.

76
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,020
Guess what?

77
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,379
I finally got a job.

78
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,599
It's about time.

79
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,659
You've been unemployed for two years.

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Example three.

81
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:27,860
We're almost there.

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,960
Just a couple more minutes.

83
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,139
It's about time.

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,719
We've been driving for 12 hours.

85
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,340
So this phrase means finally.

86
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,120
Finally, at last.

87
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,500
We've been waiting a long time for this.

88
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,180
Exactly.

89
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,979
So it's about time.

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:46,620
Great.

92
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,860
Let's take a look at our second word now.

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,360
A-I-S-L-E.

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,599
Aisle.

95
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,500
It's a tricky word.

96
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,259
It sounds like the contraction of I will.

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,020
Yeah, but it's spelled so strangely.

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:03,680
Right.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,300
We don't pronounce the S.

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,300
The S is silent.

101
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:06,919
It's true.

102
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:07,580
Aisle.

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,340
So what is an aisle?

104
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:17,980
In a big room, where you have a lot of chairs, that space in the middle that allows people to walk through, that's the aisle.

105
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,639
So the aisle is the part where you walk.

106
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,139
Yes.

107
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:21,899
In a big room.

108
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,740
In a big room.

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,480
With many chairs.

110
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,339
With many chairs.

111
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:24,939
Okay.

112
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,959
So in the church.

113
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,360
The bride and groom.

114
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:29,759
Walked on the aisle.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,360
Exactly.

116
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:31,100
Great.

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's move to our third word.

118
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,180
Bridesmaid.

119
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:35,779
Bridesmaid.

120
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,579
Bridesmaid.

121
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,139
So who are the bridesmaids?

122
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:40,660
Or wait, maybe you should ask me that.

123
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,019
Yeah, because we don't get bridesmaids.

124
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,879
Okay, so the bridesmaids are the women who are friends of the bride who stand next to her when she's getting married.

125
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,779
Usually they're her best friends.

126
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,620
Right.

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,160
Okay.

128
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,879
Okay, so we have our bridesmaids.

129
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,740
Now we have our flower girl.

130
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:01,959
Flower girl.

131
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:03,379
Flower girl.

132
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,639
Again, I'll explain this one.

133
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,240
Please, please.

134
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:14,879
The flower girl is that cute little girl who walks down the aisle and who throws flowers.

135
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,620
That's the flower girl.

136
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:21,240
And with the flower girl, we have our ring bearer.

137
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,160
Ring bearer.

138
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,879
Ring bearer.

139
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,319
So the ring bearer is the cute little boy who walks down the aisle carrying the rings.

140
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:32,800
Yep.

141
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,199
Okay, so a lot of useful vocabulary for a wedding ceremony.

142
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,379
That's true.

143
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,300
Now let's look at our last word.

144
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,500
Gorgeous.

145
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,720
Gorgeous.

146
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,079
Gorgeous.

147
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,800
Gorgeous means beautiful.

148
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,800
Very beautiful.

149
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,300
You know, beautiful you can only use with a woman.

150
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,560
Can you use gorgeous with a woman or with a man?

151
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,699
Yes, gorgeous is unisex.

152
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,180
So both men and women are gorgeous.

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,060
Right, you can say, oh, that girl is gorgeous.

154
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,139
That guy is gorgeous.

155
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:04,699
Right.

156
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,079
Or you can say even this house is gorgeous.

157
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,420
Okay, so men, women, objects.

158
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,240
Yes, yes.

159
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,199
All right.

160
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:19,579
Well, we've learned some really interesting vocabulary that will help us to understand an Anglo wedding.

161
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,420
So why don't we listen to the dialogue slowed down?

162
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,100
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

163
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,579
Yeah, well, it's about time.

164
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,779
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

165
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,439
Don't be mean.

166
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,399
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

167
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,100
Their dresses look beautiful.

168
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,100
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

169
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,759
That's the flower girl and the ring bearer.

170
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:59,620
I'm pretty sure they're the groom's niece and nephew.

171
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,480
Oh, they look so cute.

172
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:06,779
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

173
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,199
I'm starving.

174
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,579
I hope the food's good at the reception.

175
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,959
That's all you ever think about food.

176
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,199
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

177
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,519
She looks gorgeous.

178
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,860
Wait, what's she doing?

179
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:24,759
Where's she going?

180
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:26,740
Oh, great.

181
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,980
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

182
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,579
Now in this dialogue, we have a word that many students often make mistakes on.

183
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,699
So this is a word that causes a lot of problems.

184
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,519
Yes, the word marry.

185
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,600
Marry.

186
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,459
Marry, right?

187
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:55,480
So we are going to listen now to some common mistakes on how English learners use this word.

188
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,379
Right, so these are wrong examples.

189
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,360
Example one.

190
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,620
Honey, let's marry.

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,079
Example two.

192
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,240
We married four years ago.

193
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,519
Example three.

194
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,660
When I marry, I want a huge wedding.

195
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,120
These are great examples of mistakes students make with the word marry.

196
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,360
They're missing a word.

197
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,939
Let's listen to these right examples to see what word is missing.

198
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,920
Example one.

199
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,399
Honey, let's get married.

200
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,179
Example two.

201
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,320
We got married four years ago.

202
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,100
Example three.

203
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,620
When I get married, I want a huge wedding.

204
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,679
Great, so we can see that when we use the word marry, we say to get married.

205
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,600
Exactly right.

206
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:06,720
Get married.

207
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,139
To get married, right?

208
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
Okay, don't forget that.

209
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:09,799
Yes.

210
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,860
Get married.

211
00:09:11,299 --> 00:09:12,539
I will get married.

212
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,779
We got married.

213
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,980
So now you know exactly how to use this word.

214
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,480
We are ready to listen to our dialogue again for a third time, and this time it's going to be at a normal speed.

215
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,539
I can't believe that Anthony is finally getting married.

216
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,080
Yeah, well, it's about time.

217
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,279
He's been living with his parents for 40 years.

218
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,460
Don't be mean.

219
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,440
Look, here come the bridesmaids.

220
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
Their dresses look beautiful.

221
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,139
Who are those kids walking down the aisle?

222
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,639
That's the flower girl and the rainbearer.

223
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,279
I'm pretty sure that they're the groom's niece and nephew.

224
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,139
Oh, they look so cute.

225
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,200
I just hope the priest makes it quick.

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,980
I'm starving.

227
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,980
I hope the food's good at the reception.

228
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,879
That's all you ever think about.

229
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,440
Food.

230
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,399
Oh, I think the bride's coming now.

231
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,940
She looks gorgeous.

232
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,179
Wait, what's she doing?

233
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,500
Where is she going?

234
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,679
Oh, great.

235
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,700
Does this mean that the reception is canceled?

236
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,700
Okay, well, I'm going to be honest with you.

237
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:25,940
I don't know too much about marriages because, first of all, I'm not married, and I've never really been to many marriages.

238
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,179
So, Erika, some questions for you.

239
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,580
Okay.

240
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:30,620
What are these bridesmaids doing?

241
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,940
What are they about?

242
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:33,399
What do the bridesmaids do?

243
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,019
Yeah, what are they doing there?

244
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,600
Well, like I said earlier, the bridesmaids are the friends of the bride.

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:48,379
But the most important people, besides the bride and groom, are the best man and the maid of honor.

246
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,879
Okay, and what do they do there in the ceremony?

247
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,460
Well, what they do is they sign the marriage license.

248
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,320
Okay.

249
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,980
So they're like witnesses.

250
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:58,899
Exactly.

251
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,600
Okay.

252
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,820
So, but wait a minute.

253
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,940
They sign the marriage license there in the church?

254
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,860
Yeah, of course.

255
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,279
Right inside the church, you sign the marriage license.

256
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:15,379
Wow, that's strange because from what I know, in other countries, usually you will sign the marriage license before the ceremony.

257
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,500
So you get married twice.

258
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,419
Yeah, you have like the civil marriage and then you have like the church wedding or whatever.

259
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,399
That's so complicated.

260
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,399
Well, yeah, I mean, the church wedding is just a ceremony.

261
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,100
It's not really anything official.

262
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,759
Oh, in Canada, it's the official part as well.

263
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,200
I guess maybe you're just more efficient.

264
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Maybe.

265
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,240
Well, this is a really fascinating, a really interesting subject, isn't it?

266
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,399
Yeah, because there's so many countries that have different marriage ceremonies.

267
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,259
I know that marriages in India lasts around seven days.

268
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,200
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:51,679
