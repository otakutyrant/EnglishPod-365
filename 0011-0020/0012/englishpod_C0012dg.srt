EnglishPod.com Honey!

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,080
The house is such a mess!

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,240
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,660
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm in the middle of something right now.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,359
I'll be there in a second.

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,160
This can't wait!

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,460
I need your help now!

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,640
Alright, alright.

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:27,620
I'm coming.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,219
Okay, here's a list of chores we need to get done.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,560
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,159
You can sweep and mop the floors.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,420
Oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,700
You know what?

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:45,719
I have to pick something up in the mall, so why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,060
Sure, that's fine.

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,420
Here's the list of all the things we need to get.

19
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,820
Don't forget anything!

20
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,039
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,840
Hey honey, I'm back!

22
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,820
Wow, the house looks really good!

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,500
Great.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,640
Can you set the table?

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,019
Just a sec.

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,299
I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

27
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:11,519
Wait!

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,599
Don't turn it on!
