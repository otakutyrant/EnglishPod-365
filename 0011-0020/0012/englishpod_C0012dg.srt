EnglishPod.com Honey!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The house is such a mess!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm in the middle of something right now.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll be there in a second.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This can't wait!

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I need your help now!

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Alright, alright.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm coming.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, here's a list of chores we need to get done.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can sweep and mop the floors.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, and the furniture needs to be dusted.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You know what?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have to pick something up in the mall, so why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sure, that's fine.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Here's the list of all the things we need to get.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't forget anything!

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hey honey, I'm back!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Wow, the house looks really good!

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Great.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Can you set the table?

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Just a sec.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Wait!

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't turn it on!
