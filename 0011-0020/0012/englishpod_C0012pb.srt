00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we have a great intermediate lesson for you.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've got some excellent real English for you all about cleaning the house.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Cleaning the house.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's a real life situation so we're going to give you real English.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Exactly.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So in today's lesson we're going to look at language about cleaning the house.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're also going to learn a few phrases that you can use if you want to ask someone for help.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And maybe if you're a little bit lazy like me a phrase or two to avoid doing work.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay well let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Alright great.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We have two great words for you today.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Erica why don't you tell us the first one.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The first word is such a mess.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Such a mess.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Such a mess.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So when something is a mess.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's dirty.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah or things are everywhere.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Disorganized.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah so you know you have your clothes on the floor and your shoes on.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Okay so that sounds a lot like my desk at work.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Your shoes on your desk.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah I've seen that.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I've been wanting to ask you about that.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay such a mess.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Really really dirty.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay now let's take a look at our second word chores.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Chores.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Chores.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Chores.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Chores is a really common word for.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Things you have to do around the house.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Like for example laundry.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Or making the bed.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or when you have to take out the garbage.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Those are all examples of chores.

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Chores yeah.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I guess everyone can remember when they were kids they had chores to do.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah when I was a kid it was my chore to chop wood.

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Chop wood?

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah.

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's a great chore.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Playing with an axe.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Maybe if you're a boy but for a girl it was not so great.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's why you're so strong and fit.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's gonna be kind of fast.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But don't worry if you miss something because we'll explain all of the important language afterwards.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Honey the house is such a mess.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm in the middle of something right now.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll be there in a second.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This can't wait I need your help now.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Alright alright I'm coming.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can sweep and mop the floors.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You know what I have to pick something up in the mall.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sure that's fine.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Here's the list of all the things you need to get.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Don't forget anything and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey honey I'm back.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wow the house looks really good.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Great can you set the table?

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Just a sec I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wait don't turn it on!

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So my god Marco what happened there?

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
An explosion.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We love a good explosion here at EnglishPod.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We're going to give you as many explosions as possible.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So let's take a look at our language takeaway.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Language takeaway.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So language takeaway is the part of our lesson where we teach you what we think are some really important words that are found in the dialogue.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Exactly and we have three really important words in our dialogue today.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So let's start with the first one.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Tidy up.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Tidy up.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Tidy up.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So to tidy up means to?

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Put things in their correct spot.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Right so put the shoes on the floor.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Get those shoes off my desk.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Exactly so tidy up organize things a little bit.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah put things away.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay let's take a look at our second word now.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Spotless.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Spotless.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Spotless.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Spotless.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So when you want something to be spotless.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You want it to be really clean.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Really clean not a spot of dirt on it.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Like your desk.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Exactly my desk is spotless.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My desk is not spotless.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Alright great word.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway.

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mall.

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mall.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
M-A-L-L.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mall.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mall yeah.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a strange sounding word.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It is a little bit funny sounding but it basically means a large building with many shops inside.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Many different stores inside.

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right now in British English you would say shopping center.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah I think that's a little bit more common but in American English we say mall.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Great so now it's time in our show to look at putting it together.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Putting it together.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay so in putting it together we take a word from the dialogue and we show you how to use this word in real English.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So we give you a couple of examples of how this particular word can be used.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Exactly so the word that we have for today is groceries.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Groceries.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Groceries.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Groceries.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Erica why don't you tell us what groceries are all about.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So groceries are all of the food items that you need to buy at the supermarket.

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
So like your bread and milk and meat and.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Vegetables.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Exactly those are all groceries.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay so let's listen to some examples on how we use this phrase.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Example one.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's no milk can you go to the grocery store?

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Example two.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Here's the grocery list.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I need all of these things so that I can cook dinner tonight.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't forget anything.

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Example three.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I hate grocery shopping.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can never find what I'm looking for.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay great examples.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We heard some really interesting combinations right?

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah we heard grocery store.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Which is where you buy your groceries.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Exactly.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Grocery shopping.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Buying all your groceries.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And grocery list.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Where you have all the items that you need to buy.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A list of everything you need to buy.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Exactly.

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You know grocery store I think this is quite a common word in Canada.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Probably North America.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah do you say grocery store in America?

153
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well if it's a small one.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Like a small store.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In Canada I say grocery store for even like a supermarket.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Really?

157
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I guess well I would say supermarket for a large one and grocery store for a little corner shop.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All of these little differences in American Canadian English.

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue another time.

161
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This time it'll be a little bit slower.

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Honey the house is such a mess.

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm in the middle of something right now.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll be there in a second.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This can't wait.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I need your help now.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Alright alright.

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm coming.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can sweep and mop the floors.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

175
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You know what?

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have to pick something up at the mall.

177
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sure that's fine.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Here's the list of all the things you need to get.

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't forget anything.

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey honey I'm back.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Wow the house looks really good.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Great.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Can you set the table?

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Just a sec.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Wait!

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't turn it on!

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay great stuff.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Love hearing that explosion.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That vacuum just is a bomb.

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In this dialogue there was some really interesting language that you can use if you don't want to do any chores in the house.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Exactly.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So it's time now for Fluency Builder.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know Fluency Builder is a part of our show that we use to take a common phrase or a word that you already know and show you how to express that idea more fluently and more naturally.

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Exactly.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So let's take a look at our first idea that we want to explain.

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's say you're watching TV like the woman in this dialogue and your husband wants you to help him do the chores and you say no I'm busy.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Right.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Or I'm doing something.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Those are two great expressions but we heard something a little bit different in the dialogue.

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm in the middle of something right now.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm in the middle of something right now.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah that phrase is great.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It means she's busy.

207
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
She's doing something.

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah I'm in the middle of something.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And so Marco you can tell us about our next phrase.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay well now suppose that you want to say you'll be there soon.

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You might say I'll be there soon or...

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm coming.

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Exactly.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But in our dialogue we heard something a little bit different.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's listen.

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll be there in a second.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll be there in a second.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So this is a more natural way of saying I'll be there very soon.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah you know what I think I use this phrase almost every day.

220
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll be there in a second.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah yeah it's really common.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah it means I'll be there really fast.

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay so our final item today in Fluency Builder is a great phrase that helps you say the idea could you or would you.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right or can you.

226
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah so can you sweep the floor.

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Could you sweep the floor.

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But in the dialogue we heard something that's a little bit different.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket.

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Great.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
So this is more natural and it's giving a suggestion.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah it's sort of a polite way of asking someone to clean the floors.

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Right.

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a really good and polite way of saying it.

236
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah I would agree on that.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This was Fluency Builder.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue again at its normal speed.

239
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And this time you'll understand a lot better.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Honey the house is such a mess.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm in the middle of something right now.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll be there in a second.

245
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This can't wait.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I need your help now.

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,000
All right.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
All right.

249
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm coming.

250
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,000
OK.

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Here's a list of chores we need to get done.

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can sweep and mop the floors.

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

255
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You know what.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have to pick something up in the mall.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Sure that's fine.

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Here's the list of all the things you need to get.

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't forget anything.

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Hey honey I'm back.

263
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wow.

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The house looks really good.

265
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Great.

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Can you set the table.

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Just a sec.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Wait don't turn it on.

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Has this ever happened to you as your vacuum cleaner exploded in your house.

271
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well not a big explosion like this one.

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Not so dramatically and not so dramatically but I've had this happen to me before.

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah and dust everywhere is just it's a mess.

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't want to have you know this word vacuum is really a very American word.

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah vacuum vacuum the rug vacuum the carpet vacuum cleaner in the UK.

276
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What did they say Hoover Hoover Hoover Hoover the rug Hoover the rug which is interesting because it's actually a brand.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So I guess it's kind of like American English you say pass me a Kleenex.

279
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Oh that's true.

280
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That would be like a tissue.

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So I guess they say Hoover the rug or Hoover the house.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Wow.

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You know I really love these small differences in meaning that we have between American English and British English.

285
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's fun.

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
OK.

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Well another interesting thing about this is that the man was doing the house work.

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I know.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He's a house husband.

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah.

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So he's the one doing all the chores in the house.

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah that's well that's the new trend now.

293
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Now it's more popular for men to stay home and take care of the babies and clean the house.

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Like when I was growing up my dad would take out the garbage and that was it.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
My mom had to do everything else.

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But now I think it's becoming a lot more common in especially in North America for the household chores to be divided between the man and the wife.

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I think it's fair.

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Me too.

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You'd make a good husband Marco.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's what they say but they haven't married me yet.

305
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000
OK.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,000
All right.

307
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well we're out of time folks.

308
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Be sure to log on to our community Web site and you can leave all your comments and maybe other house husbands out there can give us their feedback on what they think about this.

309
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So check us out at English pod dot com and thanks for listening today everyone.

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Until next time this is Marco and Erica saying bye bye.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh yeah.
