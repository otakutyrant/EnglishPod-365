00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hello everyone and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,800
And today we have a great intermediate lesson for you.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,380
That's right.

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,119
We've got some excellent real English for you all about cleaning the house.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,039
Cleaning the house.

8
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,239
That's a real life situation so we're going to give you real English.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Exactly.

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,780
So in today's lesson we're going to look at language about cleaning the house.

11
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,120
We're also going to learn a few phrases that you can use if you want to ask someone for help.

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,020
And maybe if you're a little bit lazy like me a phrase or two to avoid doing work.

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,280
Okay well let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

14
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:42,079
Alright great.

15
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,979
We have two great words for you today.

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,600
Erica why don't you tell us the first one.

17
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:48,579
The first word is such a mess.

18
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:49,960
Such a mess.

19
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,159
Such a mess.

20
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,659
So when something is a mess.

21
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,079
It's dirty.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,460
Yeah or things are everywhere.

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,219
Disorganized.

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
Yeah so you know you have your clothes on the floor and your shoes on.

25
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,239
Okay so that sounds a lot like my desk at work.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Your shoes on your desk.

27
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah I've seen that.

28
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,719
I've been wanting to ask you about that.

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,640
Okay such a mess.

30
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,719
Really really dirty.

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,439
Okay now let's take a look at our second word chores.

32
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,459
Chores.

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,400
Chores.

34
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:19,340
Chores.

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,299
Chores is a really common word for.

36
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,459
Things you have to do around the house.

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,299
Like for example laundry.

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,719
Or making the bed.

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,780
Or when you have to take out the garbage.

40
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,700
Those are all examples of chores.

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,560
Chores yeah.

42
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,000
I guess everyone can remember when they were kids they had chores to do.

43
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,319
Yeah when I was a kid it was my chore to chop wood.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,239
Chop wood?

45
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:41,900
Yeah.

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,099
That's a great chore.

47
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,719
Playing with an axe.

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,840
Maybe if you're a boy but for a girl it was not so great.

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,120
That's why you're so strong and fit.

50
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,959
Alright so let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

51
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,519
It's gonna be kind of fast.

52
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:02,280
But don't worry if you miss something because we'll explain all of the important language afterwards.

53
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,120
Honey the house is such a mess.

54
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,240
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

55
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,639
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

56
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,400
I'm in the middle of something right now.

57
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,419
I'll be there in a second.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,460
This can't wait I need your help now.

59
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,599
Alright alright I'm coming.

60
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,219
Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done.

61
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,539
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

62
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,139
You can sweep and mop the floors.

63
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,419
Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

64
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,780
You know what I have to pick something up in the mall.

65
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,699
So why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

66
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,039
Sure that's fine.

67
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,400
Here's the list of all the things you need to get.

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
Don't forget anything and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,860
Hey honey I'm back.

70
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,840
Wow the house looks really good.

71
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,639
Great can you set the table?

72
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,280
Just a sec I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

73
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,580
Wait don't turn it on!

74
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,219
So my god Marco what happened there?

75
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,699
An explosion.

76
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,759
We love a good explosion here at EnglishPod.

77
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,639
We're going to give you as many explosions as possible.

78
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:35,819
Okay.

79
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,979
So let's take a look at our language takeaway.

80
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,560
Language takeaway.

81
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:52,240
So language takeaway is the part of our lesson where we teach you what we think are some really important words that are found in the dialogue.

82
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,280
Exactly and we have three really important words in our dialogue today.

83
00:03:57,979 --> 00:03:59,520
So let's start with the first one.

84
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,560
Tidy up.

85
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,159
Tidy up.

86
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,199
Tidy up.

87
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:06,139
So to tidy up means to?

88
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,199
Put things in their correct spot.

89
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,240
Right so put the shoes on the floor.

90
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,639
Get those shoes off my desk.

91
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,259
Exactly so tidy up organize things a little bit.

92
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,620
Yeah put things away.

93
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,480
Okay let's take a look at our second word now.

94
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,639
Spotless.

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,959
Spotless.

96
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,079
Spotless.

97
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,860
Spotless.

98
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,000
So when you want something to be spotless.

99
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,920
You want it to be really clean.

100
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:33,839
Really clean not a spot of dirt on it.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,199
Like your desk.

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,639
Exactly my desk is spotless.

103
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,040
My desk is not spotless.

104
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,540
Alright great word.

105
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,920
Now let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway.

106
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:48,180
Mall.

107
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,279
Mall.

108
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,160
M-A-L-L.

109
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,660
Mall.

110
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,680
Mall yeah.

111
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,740
It's a strange sounding word.

112
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,220
It is a little bit funny sounding but it basically means a large building with many shops inside.

113
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,839
Many different stores inside.

114
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,180
Right now in British English you would say shopping center.

115
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,600
Yeah I think that's a little bit more common but in American English we say mall.

116
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:15,019
Great so now it's time in our show to look at putting it together.

117
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,639
Putting it together.

118
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,579
Okay so in putting it together we take a word from the dialogue and we show you how to use this word in real English.

119
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,480
So we give you a couple of examples of how this particular word can be used.

120
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,660
Exactly so the word that we have for today is groceries.

121
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,000
Groceries.

122
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,040
Groceries.

123
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,959
Groceries.

124
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,079
Erica why don't you tell us what groceries are all about.

125
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,439
So groceries are all of the food items that you need to buy at the supermarket.

126
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,500
So like your bread and milk and meat and.

127
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,279
Vegetables.

128
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,100
Exactly those are all groceries.

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,420
Okay so let's listen to some examples on how we use this phrase.

130
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,980
Example one.

131
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:09,579
There's no milk can you go to the grocery store?

132
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,560
Example two.

133
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,459
Here's the grocery list.

134
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:21,620
I need all of these things so that I can cook dinner tonight.

135
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,899
Don't forget anything.

136
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,839
Example three.

137
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,939
I hate grocery shopping.

138
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,160
I can never find what I'm looking for.

139
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,879
Okay great examples.

140
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:43,740
We heard some really interesting combinations right?

141
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,459
Yeah we heard grocery store.

142
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,100
Which is where you buy your groceries.

143
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:47,860
Exactly.

144
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,660
Grocery shopping.

145
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,519
Buying all your groceries.

146
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,439
And grocery list.

147
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,959
Where you have all the items that you need to buy.

148
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,500
A list of everything you need to buy.

149
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,019
Exactly.

150
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,620
You know grocery store I think this is quite a common word in Canada.

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
Probably North America.

152
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,240
Yeah do you say grocery store in America?

153
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,579
Well if it's a small one.

154
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,160
Like a small store.

155
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
In Canada I say grocery store for even like a supermarket.

156
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,220
Really?

157
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:15,779
Yeah.

158
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:21,279
I guess well I would say supermarket for a large one and grocery store for a little corner shop.

159
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,360
All of these little differences in American Canadian English.

160
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,240
Okay I think it's time for us to listen to our dialogue another time.

161
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,060
This time it'll be a little bit slower.

162
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,720
Honey the house is such a mess.

163
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,680
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

164
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,980
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

165
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,259
I'm in the middle of something right now.

166
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:52,139
I'll be there in a second.

167
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,019
This can't wait.

168
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,139
I need your help now.

169
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,180
Alright alright.

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,420
I'm coming.

171
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,839
Okay here's a list of chores we need to get done.

172
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,959
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

173
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,839
You can sweep and mop the floors.

174
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,879
Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

175
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:16,720
You know what?

176
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,160
I have to pick something up at the mall.

177
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,860
So why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

178
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,240
Sure that's fine.

179
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:32,659
Here's the list of all the things you need to get.

180
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,500
Don't forget anything.

181
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,860
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home?

182
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,860
Hey honey I'm back.

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,100
Wow the house looks really good.

184
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,100
Great.

185
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,000
Can you set the table?

186
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
Just a sec.

187
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,080
I'm just gonna vacuum this rug real fast.

188
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:54,299
Wait!

189
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,740
Don't turn it on!

190
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,840
Okay great stuff.

191
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,240
Love hearing that explosion.

192
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,279
That vacuum just is a bomb.

193
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:16,879
In this dialogue there was some really interesting language that you can use if you don't want to do any chores in the house.

194
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:17,679
Exactly.

195
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,899
So it's time now for Fluency Builder.

196
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:36,279
You know Fluency Builder is a part of our show that we use to take a common phrase or a word that you already know and show you how to express that idea more fluently and more naturally.

197
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,179
Exactly.

198
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,320
So let's take a look at our first idea that we want to explain.

199
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:50,700
Let's say you're watching TV like the woman in this dialogue and your husband wants you to help him do the chores and you say no I'm busy.

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,860
Right.

201
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,960
Or I'm doing something.

202
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,539
Those are two great expressions but we heard something a little bit different in the dialogue.

203
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,879
I'm in the middle of something right now.

204
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,139
I'm in the middle of something right now.

205
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,600
Yeah that phrase is great.

206
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,659
It means she's busy.

207
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,539
She's doing something.

208
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,039
Yeah I'm in the middle of something.

209
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,580
And so Marco you can tell us about our next phrase.

210
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,419
Okay well now suppose that you want to say you'll be there soon.

211
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,779
You might say I'll be there soon or...

212
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:25,360
I'm coming.

213
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,019
Exactly.

214
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,299
But in our dialogue we heard something a little bit different.

215
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,139
Let's listen.

216
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,720
I'll be there in a second.

217
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,899
I'll be there in a second.

218
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,559
So this is a more natural way of saying I'll be there very soon.

219
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah you know what I think I use this phrase almost every day.

220
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,159
I'll be there in a second.

221
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah yeah it's really common.

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,559
Yeah it means I'll be there really fast.

223
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:48,980
Yes.

224
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:59,019
Okay so our final item today in Fluency Builder is a great phrase that helps you say the idea could you or would you.

225
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,779
Right or can you.

226
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,740
Yeah so can you sweep the floor.

227
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,059
Could you sweep the floor.

228
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,379
But in the dialogue we heard something that's a little bit different.

229
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,620
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket.

230
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,810
Why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket.

231
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,059
Great.

232
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,200
So this is more natural and it's giving a suggestion.

233
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,419
Yeah it's sort of a polite way of asking someone to clean the floors.

234
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:29,940
Right.

235
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,120
It's a really good and polite way of saying it.

236
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,139
Yeah I would agree on that.

237
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,740
This was Fluency Builder.

238
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,059
Now we are ready to listen to our dialogue again at its normal speed.

239
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,139
And this time you'll understand a lot better.

240
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:53,799
Honey the house is such a mess.

241
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,899
I need you to help me tidy up a bit.

242
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,820
My boss and her husband are coming over for dinner and the house needs to be spotless.

243
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,100
I'm in the middle of something right now.

244
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,100
I'll be there in a second.

245
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,799
This can't wait.

246
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,820
I need your help now.

247
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:08,919
All right.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,360
All right.

249
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,259
I'm coming.

250
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,620
OK.

251
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,860
Here's a list of chores we need to get done.

252
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,200
I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight.

253
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,799
You can sweep and mop the floors.

254
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,059
Oh and the furniture needs to be dusted.

255
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:21,360
You know what.

256
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,419
I have to pick something up in the mall.

257
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,379
So why don't you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries.

258
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,679
Sure that's fine.

259
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:32,059
Here's the list of all the things you need to get.

260
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
Don't forget anything.

261
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,720
And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home.

262
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,519
Hey honey I'm back.

263
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:44,919
Wow.

264
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:46,480
The house looks really good.

265
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:47,159
Great.

266
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:48,279
Can you set the table.

267
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,679
Just a sec.

268
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm just going to vacuum this rug real fast.

269
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,259
Wait don't turn it on.

270
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,220
Has this ever happened to you as your vacuum cleaner exploded in your house.

271
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,720
Well not a big explosion like this one.

272
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,679
Not so dramatically and not so dramatically but I've had this happen to me before.

273
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,600
Yeah and dust everywhere is just it's a mess.

274
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,960
You don't want to have you know this word vacuum is really a very American word.

275
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,299
Yeah vacuum vacuum the rug vacuum the carpet vacuum cleaner in the UK.

276
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,980
What did they say Hoover Hoover Hoover Hoover the rug Hoover the rug which is interesting because it's actually a brand.

277
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:44,580
Yeah.

278
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,320
So I guess it's kind of like American English you say pass me a Kleenex.

279
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,279
Oh that's true.

280
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,419
That would be like a tissue.

281
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:51,919
Yeah.

282
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,899
So I guess they say Hoover the rug or Hoover the house.

283
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,200
Wow.

284
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,799
You know I really love these small differences in meaning that we have between American English and British English.

285
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,120
It's fun.

286
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:04,559
OK.

287
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,820
Well another interesting thing about this is that the man was doing the house work.

288
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:09,440
I know.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,960
He's a house husband.

290
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,659
Yeah.

291
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,299
So he's the one doing all the chores in the house.

292
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,740
Yeah that's well that's the new trend now.

293
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,340
Now it's more popular for men to stay home and take care of the babies and clean the house.

294
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:22,700
Yeah.

295
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:27,679
Like when I was growing up my dad would take out the garbage and that was it.

296
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:30,419
My mom had to do everything else.

297
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:38,279
But now I think it's becoming a lot more common in especially in North America for the household chores to be divided between the man and the wife.

298
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

299
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,179
I think it's fair.

300
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:40,879
Me too.

301
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,179
Yeah.

302
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:41,440
Yeah.

303
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,639
You'd make a good husband Marco.

304
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,759
That's what they say but they haven't married me yet.

305
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,480
OK.

306
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:47,759
All right.

307
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,360
Well we're out of time folks.

308
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:57,879
Be sure to log on to our community Web site and you can leave all your comments and maybe other house husbands out there can give us their feedback on what they think about this.

309
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,159
Yeah.

310
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,139
So check us out at English pod dot com and thanks for listening today everyone.

311
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:06,480
Until next time this is Marco and Erica saying bye bye.

312
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,179
Oh yeah.
