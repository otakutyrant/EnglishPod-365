00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:05,740
Hello English learners and welcome to another great podcast with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,679
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,839
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
And today we have another really great lesson for you, elementary lesson.

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,580
That's right, and it's another lesson about money.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,480
We have no money here at EnglishPod, we are in debt here.

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,039
In debt!

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:20,879
Yes.

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:21,739
Okay.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,140
In debt.

11
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:22,539
In debt.

12
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,100
So what does that mean?

13
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:24,920
Why don't you tell us?

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,760
If I owe you money, I'm in debt.

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,800
In debt.

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,420
In fact, I think I am in debt to you.

17
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,359
You owe me $2.50 for a Coke Zero today.

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,140
That's true.

19
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:37,759
Alright.

20
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,560
Okay, so let's get started.

21
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,020
Let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:44,119
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:51,579
We have two words today in our vocabulary preview, and the first one is recession.

24
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:52,740
Recession.

25
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:53,759
Recession.

26
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:54,820
Recession.

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,020
So, recession.

28
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,000
Everyone's talking about it right now, and what does it mean?

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,060
I don't know.

30
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,719
That's your job.

31
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,340
I don't know.

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,200
I really don't know.

33
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:10,340
Why don't you tell me, Erica, because this isn't my topic for today.

34
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:19,719
Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
In a recession, the country is making less money.

36
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,040
That's true.

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,939
So maybe we can give a few examples of things that happen in a recession to show the meaning of this a little bit better.

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,980
So for example, in a recession, many people lose their jobs.

39
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:39,079
Because companies might close or go bankrupt.

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,959
Exactly.

41
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,420
And also, people start spending less money.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,420
That's true.

43
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:50,120
And the stock prices of companies fall pretty dry.

44
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,439
Yeah, they fall a lot.

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:51,980
Yeah.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,379
Yeah.

47
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:55,859
And that's what's going on now in the United States.

48
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:56,620
Very true.

49
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:01,900
Okay, so let's take a look at our second word, and it has to do with recession.

50
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,359
It's broke.

51
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,400
Broke.

52
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:05,500
Broke.

53
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm broke.

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,480
Broke.

55
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,979
It means that you have no money.

56
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:09,759
You're broke.

57
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,780
I'm broke.

58
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:11,360
Right.

59
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:17,199
So these are our two words for vocabulary preview today, and you're going to hear them in the dialogue.

60
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,780
This dialogue is about a man who is in debt.

61
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,939
He's broke.

62
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,060
Let's find out what happens.

63
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,659
Hello, I'm here to see Mr.

64
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,219
Corleone.

65
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,699
Right this way, sir.

66
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,120
Charlie, what can I do for you?

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:56,939
Mr.

68
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,219
Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

69
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,039
Anything for you, Charlie.

70
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,639
Your father was like a brother to me.

71
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,099
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,240
I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

73
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,759
I see.

74
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,360
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments.

75
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,520
I've got to pay my mortgage.

76
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,759
And on top of all that, I have to pay myself.

77
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,900
My son's college tuition.

78
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,240
So you're asking for a loan.

79
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,719
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

80
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,560
What?

81
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,419
At a time like this?

82
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,280
I'm broke too, you know.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,000
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

84
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,840
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,379
Go on, get out of here.

86
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,780
Okay, so that was a bit unexpected.

87
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,719
Yeah, that was certainly strange.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,740
He didn't go to the bank to ask for money, did he?

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,379
No, he went to the mob.

90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,219
And the mob is broke.

91
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,419
Oh, no, you know it's a bad recession when even the mob runs out of money.

92
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,740
All right, so why don't we start by looking at our language takeaway.

93
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:19,699
Language takeaway.

94
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:28,680
All right, so for today's language takeaway, we have four words from the dialogue which we think are really important.

95
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,959
Yes, so why don't we start with the first one.

96
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,199
Loan.

97
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:36,220
Loan.

98
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,300
So Erica, tell us about a loan.

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,199
What is a loan?

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,699
Okay, when you borrow money, you get a loan.

101
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,220
A loan, yes.

102
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:49,379
Not to be confused with a loan, like by myself.

103
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,519
No, so this is L-O-A-N.

104
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:53,199
Loan.

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:53,879
Right.

106
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, great.

107
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,079
Let's take a look at our second word.

108
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,180
Mortgage.

109
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,579
Now this is very common, I'm sure many of you have mortgages.

110
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,040
What is a mortgage?

111
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,779
A mortgage is a type of a loan.

112
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,560
Basically, it's a loan that helps you to buy a house.

113
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,259
A house or a property.

114
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,019
Yeah, so this is a funny word.

115
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,860
I mean, there's this strange mortgage with a T.

116
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,639
Yeah, it has a T in it, but you don't pronounce it.

117
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,339
You say mortgage, mortgage.

118
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,420
So not mort, mort-gidge.

119
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:28,500
Not mort-gidge.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,379
Mortgage.

121
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,620
Mortgage, yeah.

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,420
I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so I learned it well now.

123
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:37,339
Okay, let's move to our third word today.

124
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,420
Hit me pretty hard.

125
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,639
Hit me pretty hard.

126
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,519
Hit me pretty hard.

127
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,680
Hit me pretty hard.

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,600
I think we have some examples that will help us understand this phrase.

129
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
Example one.

130
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,500
My divorce hit me pretty hard.

131
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,259
I'm so depressed.

132
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,660
Example two.

133
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,139
This cold has hit me pretty hard.

134
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,639
I've been in bed for a week.

135
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,000
Example three.

136
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,259
The news of Fluffy's death hit me pretty hard.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,620
I've been crying for days.

138
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,360
Okay, so that's a lot clear.

139
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:35,839
Yeah.

140
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:36,300
Great.

141
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:36,480
Great.

142
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,100
Why don't we take a look at our last word for language takeaway?

143
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,339
Tuition.

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,139
Tuition.

145
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,040
Tuition.

146
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,160
Tuition.

147
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,600
So this is the money you have to pay to your school so that you can study there.

148
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:48,279
Right.

149
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,540
Usually it's in college, right, or university.

150
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,899
Yeah, but sometimes in some countries you have to pay tuition for public school.

151
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,939
Okay, great.

152
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:05,420
So it's time to listen to our dialogue again, and it's going to be slower so we can listen to all the words that we just talked about.

153
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,980
Hello.

154
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,420
I'm here to see Mr.

155
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,240
Corleone.

156
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,699
Right this way, sir.

157
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,839
Charlie, what can I do for you?

158
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr.

159
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:33,480
Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

160
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,000
Anything for you, Charlie.

161
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,079
Your father was like a brother to me.

162
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,139
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

163
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,360
I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

164
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,199
I see.

165
00:07:49,939 --> 00:08:03,779
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my mortgage, and on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,439
So you're asking for a loan?

167
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,699
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

168
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:12,800
What?

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,959
At a time like this?

170
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,120
I'm broke too, you know.

171
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,300
You're not the only one who has been hit by the recession.

172
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,079
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

173
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,759
Go on, get out of here.

174
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,940
Okay, so I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now.

175
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,500
But you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue.

176
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,940
Yes, I did too, so let's start with Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,179
Fluency Builder.

178
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:57,299
Fluency Builder is a tool that we use to help you sound more native.

179
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:00,600
Right, so you can sound more natural when you're speaking.

180
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,840
So we take a really common phrase, and we show you some great natural ways of expressing that same idea.

181
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,820
Exactly, and today we have three of these examples.

182
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,220
Let's start with the first one.

183
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,159
So this phrase we use when we want to ask somebody, can I help you?

184
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,100
What can I do for you?

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,860
What can I do for you?

186
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural.

187
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,539
Right, so instead of saying, can I help you?

188
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,779
Or, I don't know, what do you need?

189
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,340
We can just say, what can I do for you?

190
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:36,960
Exactly.

191
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:40,159
So let's move to our second phrase.

192
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,980
This phrase we use when we need something.

193
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,120
When we want to say, I'm sorry to bother you.

194
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,679
Or, I'm sorry to interrupt.

195
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,299
Okay, let's listen.

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,379
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

197
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

198
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,059
I'm sorry to trouble you.

199
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,980
This phrase might be a little bit more difficult to understand how it's used.

200
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,500
But we've got some examples.

201
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,879
Yes, so let's listen.

202
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,500
Example one.

203
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,539
Can I trouble you for a moment?

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,899
I just need you to sign this form for me.

205
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,440
Example two.

206
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,919
I'm sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today?

207
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,940
Example three.

208
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,600
Can I trouble you for a pen?

209
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,220
Mine is not working anymore.

210
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,320
Okay, so now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

211
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,259
On top of all that.

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,759
On top of all that.

213
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,919
On top of all that.

214
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
This is a really useful phrase.

215
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,000
Marco, how would you use it?

216
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,940
Well, for example, today I lost my job.

217
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,620
Oh no.

218
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,159
My car got stolen.

219
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,919
Oh my God.

220
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,019
And on top of all that, my girlfriend broke up with me.

221
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:11,480
That was a terrible day.

222
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:12,399
It was.

223
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,379
But don't worry, you can use this phrase also in a positive way.

224
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,159
That's true.

225
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,980
You could say, so today was a really great day.

226
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:28,299
It was my birthday and all my friends came to visit me and on top of all that, I got a million presents.

227
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,299
That is a great day.

228
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,700
So you can use on top of all that in this way.

229
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,740
It's like and also.

230
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,440
And also, yeah.

231
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,220
Yeah, so on top of all that.

232
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,279
So we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

233
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,360
We can hear all the words that we just talked about and all the phrases and you'll definitely be able to understand a lot better now.

234
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,080
Hello.

235
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,379
I'm here to see Mr.

236
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:00,980
Corleone.

237
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:02,919
Right this way, sir.

238
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,820
Johnny, what can I do for you?

239
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:18,620
Mr.

240
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,899
Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

241
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,740
Anything for you, Johnny.

242
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,299
Your father was like a brother to me.

243
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,799
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

244
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,960
I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

245
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,460
I see.

246
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,039
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments.

247
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,220
I've got to pay my mortgage.

248
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,600
And on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

249
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:45,940
So you're asking for a loan.

250
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,379
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,259
What?

252
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,100
At a time like this?

253
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm broke too, you know.

254
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,700
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

255
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,580
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

256
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,159
Go on, get out of here.

257
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,159
Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right?

258
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,679
Yes.

259
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,940
And different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in debt.

260
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,399
Yes, that's true.

261
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,899
For example, in North America and in Canada, it's a really common thing.

262
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,200
Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt.

263
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:34,840
It's more than good.

264
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,720
It's necessary to be in debt.

265
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,559
That's right.

266
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:46,879
Unless you have a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your debts, you can't actually borrow money.

267
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,019
You can't get a mortgage.

268
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,600
You can't get a car loan so you can buy a new car.

269
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,620
Right, that's called a credit history.

270
00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,340
So you must have a good credit history in order to be able to, like you say, buy a car or buy a house.

271
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:13,679
Yeah, and you know the funny thing is when I was in university, maybe I was 18 years old, the first thing that happened at university was banks came to our university and started offering you credit cards.

272
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,059
So you can get a credit card when you're 18, no problem.

273
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:22,580
And not only do they offer you credit cards, they give you free gifts if you sign up for a credit card.

274
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,419
I know, they really want you to have a credit card.

275
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,620
Of course, they want you to spend more money.

276
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,500
That's the trick.

277
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,460
Yeah, but you know what, it's totally different.

278
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,559
In Europe, for example, I used to live in Switzerland and there they're really careful with debt.

279
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,659
It's a bad thing to be in debt.

280
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,000
Well yeah, I mean it's bad to be in debt, definitely.

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:57,620
For example, if I want to have a credit card in Switzerland and let's say I want to have a limit of 500 francs that I can spend every month, I need to put in my bank account 700 francs before I can even spend that credit card money.

282
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,059
So it's totally opposite from North America.

283
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:07,240
Well yeah, I mean in North America it's crazy the way that people are in debt and it's showing now with the recession, right?

284
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,019
Yeah, that's true.

285
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:11,799
So everyone, be sure to handle your money carefully.

286
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't be in debt unless you really, really have to.

287
