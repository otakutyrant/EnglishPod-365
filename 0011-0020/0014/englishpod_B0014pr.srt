00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners and welcome to another great podcast with EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we have another really great lesson for you, elementary lesson.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right, and it's another lesson about money.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have no money here at EnglishPod, we are in debt here.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In debt!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In debt.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In debt.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So what does that mean?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why don't you tell us?

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If I owe you money, I'm in debt.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In debt.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In fact, I think I am in debt to you.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You owe me $2.50 for a Coke Zero today.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's true.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Alright.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, so let's get started.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We have two words today in our vocabulary preview, and the first one is recession.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Recession.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Recession.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Recession.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, recession.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Everyone's talking about it right now, and what does it mean?

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's your job.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't know.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I really don't know.

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Why don't you tell me, Erica, because this isn't my topic for today.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Recession is a period of time when the economy of a country is doing badly.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In a recession, the country is making less money.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's true.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So maybe we can give a few examples of things that happen in a recession to show the meaning of this a little bit better.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So for example, in a recession, many people lose their jobs.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Because companies might close or go bankrupt.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Exactly.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And also, people start spending less money.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's true.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And the stock prices of companies fall pretty dry.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, they fall a lot.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And that's what's going on now in the United States.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Very true.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay, so let's take a look at our second word, and it has to do with recession.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's broke.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Broke.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Broke.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm broke.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Broke.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It means that you have no money.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're broke.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm broke.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So these are our two words for vocabulary preview today, and you're going to hear them in the dialogue.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This dialogue is about a man who is in debt.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He's broke.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's find out what happens.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hello, I'm here to see Mr.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Corleone.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Right this way, sir.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Charlie, what can I do for you?

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mr.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Anything for you, Charlie.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your father was like a brother to me.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I see.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've got to pay my mortgage.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And on top of all that, I have to pay myself.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
My son's college tuition.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So you're asking for a loan.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At a time like this?

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm broke too, you know.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Go on, get out of here.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so that was a bit unexpected.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, that was certainly strange.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He didn't go to the bank to ask for money, did he?

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, he went to the mob.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And the mob is broke.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, no, you know it's a bad recession when even the mob runs out of money.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right, so why don't we start by looking at our language takeaway.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Language takeaway.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right, so for today's language takeaway, we have four words from the dialogue which we think are really important.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, so why don't we start with the first one.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Loan.

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Loan.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So Erica, tell us about a loan.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What is a loan?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, when you borrow money, you get a loan.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A loan, yes.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Not to be confused with a loan, like by myself.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, so this is L-O-A-N.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Loan.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, great.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's take a look at our second word.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mortgage.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now this is very common, I'm sure many of you have mortgages.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What is a mortgage?

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
A mortgage is a type of a loan.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Basically, it's a loan that helps you to buy a house.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
A house or a property.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, so this is a funny word.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I mean, there's this strange mortgage with a T.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, it has a T in it, but you don't pronounce it.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You say mortgage, mortgage.

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So not mort, mort-gidge.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not mort-gidge.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mortgage.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mortgage, yeah.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I had trouble spelling that one for this lesson, so I learned it well now.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, let's move to our third word today.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hit me pretty hard.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hit me pretty hard.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hit me pretty hard.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hit me pretty hard.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think we have some examples that will help us understand this phrase.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Example one.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My divorce hit me pretty hard.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm so depressed.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Example two.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This cold has hit me pretty hard.

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I've been in bed for a week.

135
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Example three.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The news of Fluffy's death hit me pretty hard.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've been crying for days.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, so that's a lot clear.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Great.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Great.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why don't we take a look at our last word for language takeaway?

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tuition.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tuition.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Tuition.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Tuition.

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So this is the money you have to pay to your school so that you can study there.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Right.

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Usually it's in college, right, or university.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, but sometimes in some countries you have to pay tuition for public school.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, great.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So it's time to listen to our dialogue again, and it's going to be slower so we can listen to all the words that we just talked about.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hello.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm here to see Mr.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Corleone.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right this way, sir.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Charlie, what can I do for you?

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Anything for you, Charlie.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Your father was like a brother to me.

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I lost my job, and I'm in a lot of debt.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I see.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments, I've got to pay my mortgage, and on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So you're asking for a loan?

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What?

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
At a time like this?

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm broke too, you know.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're not the only one who has been hit by the recession.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Go on, get out of here.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, so I think a lot of the key language we just talked about is a lot more clear now.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But you know, I also noticed some really interesting phrases in this dialogue.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yes, I did too, so let's start with Fluency Builder.

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Fluency Builder.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fluency Builder is a tool that we use to help you sound more native.

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Right, so you can sound more natural when you're speaking.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So we take a really common phrase, and we show you some great natural ways of expressing that same idea.

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Exactly, and today we have three of these examples.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's start with the first one.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So this phrase we use when we want to ask somebody, can I help you?

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What can I do for you?

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What can I do for you?

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, that sounds really, really polite and really natural.

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right, so instead of saying, can I help you?

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Or, I don't know, what do you need?

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We can just say, what can I do for you?

190
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Exactly.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So let's move to our second phrase.

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This phrase we use when we need something.

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
When we want to say, I'm sorry to bother you.

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Or, I'm sorry to interrupt.

195
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, let's listen.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm really sorry to trouble you.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry to trouble you.

199
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This phrase might be a little bit more difficult to understand how it's used.

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But we've got some examples.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes, so let's listen.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Example one.

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can I trouble you for a moment?

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just need you to sign this form for me.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Example two.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry to trouble you, but may I go home early today?

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Example three.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Can I trouble you for a pen?

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mine is not working anymore.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, so now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
On top of all that.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
On top of all that.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
On top of all that.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is a really useful phrase.

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Marco, how would you use it?

216
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, for example, today I lost my job.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh no.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My car got stolen.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh my God.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And on top of all that, my girlfriend broke up with me.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That was a terrible day.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It was.

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But don't worry, you can use this phrase also in a positive way.

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's true.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You could say, so today was a really great day.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It was my birthday and all my friends came to visit me and on top of all that, I got a million presents.

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That is a great day.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So you can use on top of all that in this way.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like and also.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And also, yeah.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, so on top of all that.

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So we are ready to listen to our dialogue a third time.

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We can hear all the words that we just talked about and all the phrases and you'll definitely be able to understand a lot better now.

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hello.

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm here to see Mr.

236
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Corleone.

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Right this way, sir.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Johnny, what can I do for you?

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Mr.

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Corleone, I'm really sorry to trouble you, but I need your help.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Anything for you, Johnny.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Your father was like a brother to me.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, sir, you see, this recession has hit me pretty hard.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I lost my job and I'm in a lot of debt.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I see.

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, you know, I've got credit card bills, car payments.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've got to pay my mortgage.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And on top of all that, I have to pay my son's college tuition.

249
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So you're asking for a loan.

250
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Well, I just thought maybe you could help me out.

251
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
At a time like this?

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm broke too, you know.

254
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're not the only one who's been hit by the recession.

255
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I lost half my money in the stock market crash.

256
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Go on, get out of here.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Today's dialogue was all about being in debt, right?

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And different people have different attitudes or different viewpoints on being in debt.

260
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes, that's true.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
For example, in North America and in Canada, it's a really common thing.

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, it's actually almost good to be in debt.

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's more than good.

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's necessary to be in debt.

265
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's right.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Unless you have a history of being in debt and regularly paying off your debts, you can't actually borrow money.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't get a mortgage.

268
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You can't get a car loan so you can buy a new car.

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Right, that's called a credit history.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So you must have a good credit history in order to be able to, like you say, buy a car or buy a house.

271
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, and you know the funny thing is when I was in university, maybe I was 18 years old, the first thing that happened at university was banks came to our university and started offering you credit cards.

272
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So you can get a credit card when you're 18, no problem.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And not only do they offer you credit cards, they give you free gifts if you sign up for a credit card.

274
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I know, they really want you to have a credit card.

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Of course, they want you to spend more money.

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's the trick.

277
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, but you know what, it's totally different.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
In Europe, for example, I used to live in Switzerland and there they're really careful with debt.

279
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's a bad thing to be in debt.

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well yeah, I mean it's bad to be in debt, definitely.

281
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:57,000
For example, if I want to have a credit card in Switzerland and let's say I want to have a limit of 500 francs that I can spend every month, I need to put in my bank account 700 francs before I can even spend that credit card money.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So it's totally opposite from North America.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well yeah, I mean in North America it's crazy the way that people are in debt and it's showing now with the recession, right?

284
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, that's true.

285
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So everyone, be sure to handle your money carefully.

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't be in debt unless you really, really have to.

287
