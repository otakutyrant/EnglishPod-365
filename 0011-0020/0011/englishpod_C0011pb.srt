1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,599
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:05,480
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,219
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,699
And today with Erica, we have an upper intermediate lesson.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,339
That's right.

6
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,880
An upper intermediate lesson that's a little bit strange.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,620
It's a little bit strange, but it's a real English lesson because that's what we give you here at EnglishPod.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,399
So in today's lesson, we've got a lot of really great language for you.

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,100
We've got language to help you to gossip better.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:26,800
Gossip.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,399
Why don't you explain it a little bit, just in case?

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:37,420
OK, so if I gossip, I maybe share news or information about other people with my friends.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Like I might say something like, Marco, did you see what happened in ChinesePod today?

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,320
You'll never guess what I saw.

15
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:45,340
Exactly.

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,219
That's gossip.

17
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:50,140
And we also have language today to describe things.

18
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,119
To describe strange things.

19
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,219
Strange things.

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,060
All right.

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,939
So let's take a look at our vocabulary preview.

22
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,240
Vocabulary preview.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:07,340
So in our vocabulary preview, we'll look at a few important words that will help you to understand the dialogue a little bit better.

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:08,500
Exactly.

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,280
And the first word is weird.

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,260
Weird.

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,019
Weird.

28
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,780
Now, this is a common word you probably hear all the time and in a lot of different situations.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,000
So we wanted to explain it today.

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,420
Yeah.

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,379
This word just means strange.

32
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:25,379
It's strange.

33
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,700
Weird person is a strange person.

34
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,120
Exactly.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,579
But the thing about this word is if you are a young person, let's say under the age of thirty five, you'll probably use it about a hundred times a day.

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:37,980
Weird.

37
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:38,540
Yeah.

38
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,700
It's just such a good sounding word.

39
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,219
Weird.

40
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,159
It is.

41
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:42,799
OK.

42
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:51,120
But the thing is that even though it is probably more commonly used in American English, it's still widely used for British English as well.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,060
Yeah, that's true.

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,519
But maybe in British English you would say something like odd.

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,260
It's odd.

46
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:57,620
Yeah.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,500
That's more common.

48
00:01:59,099 --> 00:01:59,219
OK.

49
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,900
Let's look at our second word.

50
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:02,579
House warming gift.

51
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:03,959
House warming gift.

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,620
House warming gift.

53
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:06,879
House warming gift.

54
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,379
Now this is a cultural thing.

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,699
It's really common in North America to give a house warming gift to someone.

56
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,099
Yeah.

57
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:20,539
If I move into a new house, maybe some of my friends or family will bring a gift over to make my house a little bit more beautiful.

58
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:28,560
So something like a photo frame or or maybe a plant or sometimes even like maybe a basket of pastries or something.

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,000
OK.

60
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,539
Yeah.

61
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,000
I've never gotten one of those.

62
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:31,300
Really?

63
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:31,939
I don't have a home.

64
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,219
Where do you live?

65
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,759
On the street?

66
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,419
Well, I don't have my own home, so I have never gotten one of those.

67
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:37,879
OK.

68
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,539
OK.

69
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:41,219
So we're ready now to listen to our dialogue.

70
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:47,800
So we've got two housewives who are gossiping about what's going on in the neighborhood and let's listen to what happens.

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,039
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

72
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,460
Yeah, I know.

73
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,139
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,699
His name is Armand.

75
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,719
Really?

76
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:06,719
What's he like?

77
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,139
You have to fill me in.

78
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,479
Actually, he's a bit strange.

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,159
I don't know.

80
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

81
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,240
Really?

82
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,099
Why?

83
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:22,800
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird and then he practically kicked me out.

84
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,560
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look.

85
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,500
The whole thing really creeped me out.

86
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,580
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

87
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:37,819
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

88
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,699
It almost looked like a coffin.

89
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,139
You see?

90
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,520
Why would he?

91
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,199
Hello, ladies.

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,360
Armand!

93
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,439
Oh, you scared the heck out of me.

94
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,219
This is my friend, Doris.

95
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,599
It's a pleasure to meet you.

96
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,659
If you're not doing anything tonight, I'd like to have you both for dinner.

97
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:59,080
I mean, I'd like to have you both over for dinner.

98
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,300
Ooh, that guy seems kind of weird.

99
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,139
You can hear his voice is like a weird guy, right?

100
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:16,019
All right.

101
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,339
Let's take a look at our language takeaway and look at some of these great words.

102
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,600
Language takeaway.

103
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:32,379
So our language takeaway focuses on several words from the dialogue that we feel are really important for you to know.

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,120
Exactly.

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,860
And we have four of them for you today.

106
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,319
Why don't we look at the first one?

107
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,540
Okay, so the first word is a bad feeling.

108
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:40,939
Bad feeling.

109
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,079
A bad feeling.

110
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:43,319
A bad feeling.

111
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,060
So we've got a few examples that will help you to understand how this phrase works.

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,579
Example one.

113
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,240
I don't like Kelly's new boyfriend.

114
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,439
I've got a bad feeling about him.

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,879
Example two.

116
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,779
It's so dark.

117
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,319
We shouldn't be out here.

118
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,740
I've got a bad feeling about this.

119
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,459
Example three.

120
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,240
I've got a bad feeling about this trip.

121
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,779
I feel like something's going to happen.

122
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,639
Maybe we shouldn't go.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,740
Okay, so basically you think something bad is going to happen.

124
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,680
Yeah, you have a sort of uncomfortable feeling.

125
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,199
Okay, that makes sense.

126
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,040
I have a bad feeling about something.

127
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:39,579
Exactly.

128
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,040
Okay, let's look at our second word now.

129
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:42,939
Kicked me out.

130
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,060
Kicked me out.

131
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:45,199
Kicked me out.

132
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,100
Kicked me out.

133
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,819
So when someone kicks you out, they force you to leave.

134
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,800
You don't want to leave, but they force you to leave.

135
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,860
Marco, have you ever kicked someone out of your class?

136
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,660
Yes, I have.

137
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:58,060
Really?

138
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,240
If you misbehave in my class, you're kicked out.

139
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,379
So you're pretty strict, huh?

140
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,120
Sometimes I am.

141
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,779
Okay, also maybe you've kicked your husband out of bed.

142
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,980
I might have done that once or twice before.

143
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,160
We'll have to ask him.

144
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,879
I'm sure he has.

145
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,639
All right, so that's what it means.

146
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,560
You force someone to leave the house, leave the class, leave the bed.

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,660
So kicked out of class, kicked out of the house, kicked out of bed.

148
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,360
Exactly.

149
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,240
Great.

150
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,600
Let's look at our third word now.

151
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,240
Creeped me out.

152
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,699
Creeped me out.

153
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,439
Creeped me out.

154
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,779
Creeped me out.

155
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,959
Now this is a really common phrase.

156
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:40,680
I like this phrase a lot and we've got some examples for you to listen to, to help you understand this word a little bit better.

157
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:43,560
Example one.

158
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,220
Shh.

159
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:50,459
Did you hear that?

160
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,759
Oh, I think I saw something.

161
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,100
Stop it.

162
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,480
You're really creeping me out.

163
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:01,459
Example two.

164
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,139
This place really creeps me out.

165
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,660
Let's get out of here.

166
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,019
All right.

167
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,560
Well, I have a confession to make.

168
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,220
I'm kind of creeped out by clowns.

169
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,079
You are?

170
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,120
I don't know.

171
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,040
They're just creepy.

172
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,399
They scare me.

173
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:20,579
Yeah.

174
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:23,079
What is it about clowns that scare you so much?

175
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,639
I don't know.

176
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,819
They're just white faces and weird paint.

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,420
I don't know.

178
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,199
It's just creepy.

179
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:29,300
The way they laugh.

180
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,100
I don't know.

181
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,339
Maybe you had a bad experience with clowns as a child.

182
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,439
I watched the scary movie about clowns or something.

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,480
All right.

184
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,019
So creeped me out basically means made me feel uncomfortable.

185
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:40,639
Yes.

186
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,079
It scares you.

187
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:51,819
Well, speaking of being scared, we have our final word for language takeaway and it is scared the heck out of me.

188
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,839
You scared the heck out of me.

189
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,000
Scared the heck out of me.

190
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,279
You got really scared.

191
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:57,660
Yeah.

192
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,220
I think this is a quite common way of saying you really, really scared me.

193
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:01,920
Okay.

194
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,939
We're ready to listen to our dialogue again.

195
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,680
Now try and see if you can catch all these phrases that we just talked about.

196
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,079
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

197
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,959
Yeah, I know.

198
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,220
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

199
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,740
His name is Armand.

200
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,860
Really?

201
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,480
What's he like?

202
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,740
You have to fill me in.

203
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,039
Actually, he's a bit strange.

204
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,460
I don't know.

205
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,379
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

206
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,440
Really?

207
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,639
Why?

208
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:54,340
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird and then he practically kicked me out.

209
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,100
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look.

210
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,100
The whole thing really creeped me out.

211
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,820
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

212
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:19,059
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

213
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,960
It almost looked like a coffin.

214
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,679
You see?

215
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,159
Why would he...

216
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,200
Hello, ladies.

217
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,500
Ah, Armand, you scared the heck out of me.

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,259
This is my friend, Doris.

219
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,419
A pleasure to meet you.

220
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:43,279
If you are not doing anything tonight, I would like to have you both for dinner.

221
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,539
I mean, I would like to have you both over for dinner.

222
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,940
You know, one of the things I really like about this dialogue is there's a lot of great phrases that will help you to gossip.

223
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,340
That's a good observation, so I think it's time for fluency builder.

224
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,600
Fluency builder.

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:18,419
In Fluency Builder, we take a simple phrase or a simple word you already know and show you how to express the same idea a little bit more naturally.

226
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,440
Okay, great.

227
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,340
So let's take a look at our first item for Fluency Builder.

228
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:29,019
So when you gossip with somebody, you often tell them news or information that they don't know already.

229
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,620
And you might start by saying, did you know that?

230
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,480
Or you can say, did you hear?

231
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,419
Yeah, both of those phrases are perfectly fine.

232
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,200
But if you want to sound a little bit more native-like when you're gossiping, you might try out this phrase from the dialogue.

233
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,980
I don't know if you've heard.

234
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,039
I don't know if you've heard.

235
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,799
Yeah, that's a really good phrase.

236
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,600
You're saying exactly the same thing, but in a really natural way.

237
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,240
It's a great one for gossiping.

238
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,799
So Marco, I don't know if you've heard, but Chinese pod is up to some pretty crazy things.

239
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,279
See, that's exactly how you would use that phrase.

240
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,360
So now let's take a look at our second item.

241
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,919
Now when you're gossiping, you want information.

242
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,700
That's right.

243
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:16,639
So you might say, oh, tell me about it.

244
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,600
Or something like, give me the details.

245
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,379
Yeah, and again, both of these examples are perfectly fine.

246
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,860
But when you're gossiping, you might want to try something like this.

247
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,120
You have to fill me in.

248
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,179
You have to fill me in.

249
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,379
Fill me in.

250
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,059
Yeah, that's what I would say.

251
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,639
Fill me in.

252
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:39,659
Give me the details.

253
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,279
Fill me in.

254
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:41,879
Fill me in on today's gossip.

255
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,120
Okay, so let's take a look at our third item.

256
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,240
Now if you have some juicy gossipy news.

257
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,279
And you want to start up a conversation, you might use this phrase here.

258
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,299
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

259
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,100
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

260
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,620
That's a really good phrase.

261
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,840
You can change it a little bit.

262
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:10,700
You can say, you'll never guess who I saw.

263
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:12,919
Or you'll never guess what I heard.

264
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:13,840
Exactly.

265
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,879
Very excellent gossip phrases.

266
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,360
We're teaching you how to gossip because that's real English.

267
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,379
People really do it.

268
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:21,840
So you got to know the language for it.

269
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,299
All right, so enough of our gossip.

270
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,059
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue one last time.

271
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,580
Oh, I don't know if you've heard, but someone moved into that old house down the road.

272
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,039
Yeah, I know.

273
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,659
I met the owner of the house yesterday as he was moving in.

274
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:43,340
His name is Armand.

275
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,320
Really?

276
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,279
What's he like?

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,700
You have to fill me in.

278
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,019
Actually, he's a bit strange.

279
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:49,720
I don't know.

280
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:52,179
I've just got a bad feeling about him.

281
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:52,799
Really?

282
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,620
Why?

283
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:01,320
Well, yesterday I brought over a housewarming gift, but Armand started acting really weird and then he practically kicked me out.

284
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,100
I tried to sort of peek into his house, but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look.

285
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,980
The whole thing really creeped me out.

286
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,120
Well, you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

287
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,360
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

288
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,279
You almost look like a coffin.

289
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,700
You see?

290
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,759
Why would he- Hello, ladies.

291
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:22,879
Armand!

292
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, you scared the heck out of me.

293
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,740
This is my friend Doris.

294
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,120
It's a pleasure to meet you.

295
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,220
If you're not doing anything tonight, I'd like to have you both for dinner.

296
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,360
I mean, I'd like to have you both over for dinner.

297
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,879
Okay, Marco, I have a true story for you.

298
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:50,500
Is it kind of like a creepy story?

299
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,620
It is a creepy story indeed.

300
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,039
Is it a true story?

301
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,840
No, it's really true.

302
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:01,879
So when I was young, I used to live in the country and you know, in the country, all of the neighbors know each other.

303
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,419
It's a small community, so everyone knows what's happening all the time.

304
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:05,899
Okay.

305
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:18,220
And there was some gossip going on in our community about a guy who lived at the end of the road and he was the owner of a car wrecking yard.

306
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:23,519
So a place where you take old broken down cars and take the parts apart to sell.

307
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,559
And anyway- A scrap yard.

308
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,460
Yeah, a scrap yard.

309
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:26,860
All right.

310
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,200
Okay.

311
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,700
So, you know, he had a wife and a couple of kids and suddenly his wife disappeared.

312
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,500
Wow.

313
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah.

314
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:37,899
And no one knew what happened or anything.

315
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:46,399
And so several years pass and suddenly the police start coming in and start investigating this guy and start digging up all of the land around his property.

316
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,259
And I guess, I don't know what they're doing, but I think they were looking for the wife's body.

317
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:52,080
Wow.

318
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,200
And did they find it?

319
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:53,679
I don't know.

320
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,299
I moved away.

321
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,720
Oh, such a great story, but we don't know how it ends.

322
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,580
Well, we can leave it up to the imagination of our listeners.

323
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:03,259
Exactly.

324
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,620
Maybe they were looking for an old car.

325
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,320
An old car buried in the ground.

326
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,500
I don't think so.

327
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:09,720
All right.

328
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
That's a true story.

329
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:11,879
Real English.

330
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,620
Real stories.

331
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,200
There you go.

332
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,539
You heard it first here on EnglishPod.

333
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,580
All right.

334
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,620
So we want to hear your comments and suggestions about this topic.

335
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:28,100
I bet a lot of our listeners also have creepy stories, maybe ghost stories, maybe, I don't know, different types of weird stories.

336
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,279
So you guys should definitely log on to EnglishPod and share them with us.

337
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:32,700
That's right.

338

Go to EnglishPod.com and in the comments section of the website, tell us your creepy stories.

339
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,940
And we're going to pick out the best story as the story of the week.

340
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,419
We'll announce it in our This Just In podcast.

341
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:45,919
Yes.

342
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:49,899
So we want to hear all your juicy stories and gossip maybe as well.

343
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:50,299
Yes.

344
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:51,879
All right.

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,419
Well, it's time for us to go.

346
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,019
So be sure to listen to us next time.

347

Bye.
