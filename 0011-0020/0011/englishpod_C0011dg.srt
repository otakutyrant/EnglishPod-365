00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:35,500
EnglishPod.com housewarming gift but Armand started acting really weird and then he practically kicked me out.

2
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:41,280
I tried to sort of peek into his house but everything was so dark inside that I couldn't really get a good look.

3
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,200
The whole thing really creeped me out.

4
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,280
Well you'll never guess what I saw this morning.

5
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,560
A delivery truck pulled into his driveway and it dropped off a long rectangular box.

6
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,439
It almost looked like a coffin.

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:53,840
You see?

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
Why would he...

9
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,580
Armand!

10
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,159
You scared the heck out of me.

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,899
This is my friend Doris.

12
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,280
Pleasure to meet you.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,359
If you're not doing anything tonight I'd like to have you both for dinner.

14
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:11,500
I mean I'd like to have you both over for dinner.
