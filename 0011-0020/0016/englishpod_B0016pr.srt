00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name's Erika, and I'm here with Marco.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Marco, hurry up!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm coming!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hurry up, Marco!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've got a lesson!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay, I'm here, I'm here.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What did I miss?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The lesson.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
All right, sorry about that.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We have a great lesson for you today.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We have an elementary lesson.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's right, an elementary lesson about being in a rush, and about giving directions when you're in a car.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Exactly.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to listen to two friends who are getting in a car, and they're getting ready to go somewhere, and they're in a big hurry.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So let's hurry up and listen to the dialogue.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hurry up, get in!

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm in, let's go.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, make a left here.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No wait, I meant make a right.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Come on, speed up.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Geez, what's the rush?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't worry about it, just drive.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh no, the light is about to change, step on it.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you nuts?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm not going to run a red light.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Whatever, just turn right here.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's take a side street.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Go on, get out of our way!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Move, move!

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's your problem?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Geez, having a fit is not going to help.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Here, I know a shortcut.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just go down here, and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go, let's go!

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Watch out for that lady.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going as fast as I can.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, we made it!

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
558, just before the library closes.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're such a geek.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So they were in a hurry, and it was all just to get to the library.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, maybe he was late returning a book or something.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's a bit dramatic, just for returning a book.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Alright, why don't we look at our language takeaway for today.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Language takeaway.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, on today's language takeaway we have five words for you today.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Five really important and useful words that we found in our dialogue.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So let's take a look at the first one.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Step on it.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Step on it.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Step on it.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So what does it mean when I tell you to step on it?

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Drive faster.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Drive faster, right?

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Step on it.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Exactly, you might also say speed up.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Speed up, yes.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's exactly it.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Our second word, speed up.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Also means go faster.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go faster.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And what about the opposite?

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You might say slow down.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Slow down.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, so speed up and slow down.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So our third word for today is having a fit.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Having a fit.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Having a fit.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Having a fit.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Well this is a funny phrase and I think listening to a few examples of this phrase might help us understand its meaning a little bit better.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Example one.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Geez, you don't need to have a fit.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Nothing is going to happen if we're five minutes late.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Example two.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My boss is going to have a fit if I don't finish this on time.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Example three.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I almost had a fit when my boss told me I had to work this weekend.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, great example.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So Erica, why don't you tell me what does it mean when you have a fit?

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It means you get really angry and you can't control your emotions.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So maybe you start screaming and maybe some steam comes out of your ears.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, that's having a fit.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Exactly.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Excellent.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, let's take a look at our next word now.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Cut through.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Cut through.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Cut through.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When you cut through something it means you just go through.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, quite simple.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It gives you the idea that you go through something quickly.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Quickly, so I can say let's cut through the park.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yep, or let's cut through the backyard.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, go through.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And this takes us to our last word for today.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shortcut.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shortcut.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Shortcut.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is a really common word and not many people know about it.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, you're right.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's two simple words that when you fit them together the meaning changes.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a great example of this real English we talk about.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And it means to take a shorter way somewhere.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Exactly.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So if I take a shortcut I go the short way.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, so going back just a little bit to cut through.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If I cut through the park that's basically a shortcut.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Alright, now it's clear.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now it's time to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it's going to be slower so then we can understand all these words that we just talked about.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Geez.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's the rush?

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't worry about it.

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Just drive.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh no, the light is about to change.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Step on it.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you nuts?

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not going to run a red light.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Whatever.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Just turn right here.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's take a side street.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Go on.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Get out of our way.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Move.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Move.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's your problem?

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Geez.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Having a fit is not going to help.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Here.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know a shortcut.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's go.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's go.

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Watch out for that lady.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm going as fast as I can.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We made it.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
5.58.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just before the library closes.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're such a geek.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
OK.

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well I think that was a lot more clear this time.

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know there was some great language in that dialogue and I would like to look at how we can put it together.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Putting it together.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
OK.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So today I'm putting it together.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We have three phrases for you.

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And we're going to show you how you can use these phrases like a native speaker.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
OK.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So all of these phrases we heard in the dialogue.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why don't we start with the first one.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Make a.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Make a.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So in the dialogue they say make a left here.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we can extend this phrase to say make a right.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That would be the equivalent of saying turn left.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Or turn right.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Turn right.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And there's one more.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Make a U-turn.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Exactly.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That means turn the car 180 degrees all the way around.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Make a U-turn.

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So make a left.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Make a right.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Make a U-turn.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you're ever in a taxi and you're telling the taxi driver where to go.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is the perfect way.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Make a left here.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Make a right there.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
OK.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So let's move to our second phrase and it is Are you nuts?

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you nuts?

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you nuts?

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So this is a great way of saying Are you crazy?

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Are you insane?

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you mad?

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So when would we use a phrase like this?

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If somebody has a bad idea that you don't agree with you would say are you crazy or are you nuts?

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
So Marco let's stop this podcast right now.

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you nuts?

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
OK.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I think that's a good example of how we can use this phrase.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So are you nuts?

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Are you insane?

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you mad?

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So let's listen to some examples of Are you nuts?

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Example 1 You want to get married now?

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Are you nuts?

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You only met her three weeks ago.

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Example 2 Are you nuts?

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm not going to cheat on the exam.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What if I get caught?

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I think that's clear.

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And now we can move to our third phrase which is Let's take a side street.

199
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's take a side street.

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's take a side street.

201
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Again so if you're in a taxi this is a great way to suggest a route.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Or suggest a direction.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So we can take this phrase and extend it out with a few more words.

205
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We might say let's take Wilson Avenue.

206
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Right.

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Or let's take the highway.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So let's take a side street.

209
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's take Wilson Avenue.

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's take the freeway.

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OK.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So now let's take a listen to this dialogue a third time at its normal speed and now you can understand everything that's in this dialogue.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Example 3 Hurry up.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Get in.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm in.

216
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's go.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
OK.

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Make a left here.

219
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
No wait.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I meant make a right.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come on.

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Speed up.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Jeez.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's the rush?

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't worry about it.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Just drive.

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh no.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The light is about to change.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Step on it.

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you nuts?

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm not going to run a red light.

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Whatever.

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Just turn right here.

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's take a side street.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Go on.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Get out of our way.

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Move.

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Move.

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's your problem?

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Jeez.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Having a fit is not going to help.

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Here.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I know a shortcut.

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's go.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Watch out for that lady.

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm going as fast as I can.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We made it.

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
558 just before the library closes.

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're such a geek.

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Well this dialogue is all about driving, right?

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And in North America, where both of us are from, driving is everything.

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Everybody has a car.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When did you get a car?

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, my car I got when I was like maybe 19.

260
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Really?

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I learned how to drive and I was driving already by the age of 16.

262
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, that's the thing.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
In many countries, you have to wait until I think you're 18 to drive.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But in North America, everyone has a driver's license by the time they're 16 years old.

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I guess everything is so far away that you need a car.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a lot less likely to have subways or trains to travel by in North America.

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
All right.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So now you have all the tools necessary to give directions the next time you're in a car or in a taxi.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well everyone, I really hope you enjoyed this lesson.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Now I want to remind you all to come to our EnglishPod website at EnglishPod.com and here you'll find a lot of tools to help you understand our podcasts better.

273
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So with that, until next time, this is goodbye.
