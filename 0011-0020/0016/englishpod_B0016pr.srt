00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:05,440
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:09,080
My name's Erika, and I'm here with Marco.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,179
Marco, hurry up!

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm coming!

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,199
Hurry up, Marco!

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:14,960
We've got a lesson!

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,480
Okay, I'm here, I'm here.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,519
What did I miss?

9
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:20,920
The lesson.

10
00:00:22,179 --> 00:00:23,559
All right, sorry about that.

11
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,100
We have a great lesson for you today.

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,660
We have an elementary lesson.

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,539
That's right, an elementary lesson about being in a rush, and about giving directions when you're in a car.

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:36,579
Exactly.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:46,700
We're going to listen to two friends who are getting in a car, and they're getting ready to go somewhere, and they're in a big hurry.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,539
So let's hurry up and listen to the dialogue.

17
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,020
Hurry up, get in!

18
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm in, let's go.

19
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:12,340
Okay, make a left here.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,099
No wait, I meant make a right.

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,980
Come on, speed up.

22
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,260
Geez, what's the rush?

23
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,500
Don't worry about it, just drive.

24
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,700
Oh no, the light is about to change, step on it.

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,819
Are you nuts?

26
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm not going to run a red light.

27
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,280
Whatever, just turn right here.

28
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:30,019
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,459
Let's take a side street.

30
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,099
Go on, get out of our way!

31
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:36,099
Move, move!

32
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,900
What's your problem?

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,299
Geez, having a fit is not going to help.

34
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,060
Here, I know a shortcut.

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,819
Just go down here, and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,159
Let's go, let's go!

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,500
Watch out for that lady.

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,799
I'm going as fast as I can.

39
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:56,500
Yes, we made it!

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,579
558, just before the library closes.

41
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:00,560
You're such a geek.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,300
So they were in a hurry, and it was all just to get to the library.

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,659
Well, maybe he was late returning a book or something.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,560
That's a bit dramatic, just for returning a book.

45
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,419
Alright, why don't we look at our language takeaway for today.

46
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,099
Language takeaway.

47
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, on today's language takeaway we have five words for you today.

48
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:32,159
Five really important and useful words that we found in our dialogue.

49
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,560
So let's take a look at the first one.

50
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,900
Step on it.

51
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,979
Step on it.

52
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,560
Step on it.

53
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:43,240
So what does it mean when I tell you to step on it?

54
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:44,620
Drive faster.

55
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:45,979
Drive faster, right?

56
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,680
Step on it.

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,219
Exactly, you might also say speed up.

58
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:51,699
Speed up, yes.

59
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,900
That's exactly it.

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,000
Our second word, speed up.

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,719
Also means go faster.

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:02:59,740
Go faster.

63
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,240
And what about the opposite?

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,919
You might say slow down.

65
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,020
Slow down.

66
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,219
Okay, so speed up and slow down.

67
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,740
So our third word for today is having a fit.

68
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,539
Having a fit.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,639
Having a fit.

70
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Having a fit.

71
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:28,039
Well this is a funny phrase and I think listening to a few examples of this phrase might help us understand its meaning a little bit better.

72
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
Example one.

73
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,960
Geez, you don't need to have a fit.

74
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,000
Nothing is going to happen if we're five minutes late.

75
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,699
Example two.

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,219
My boss is going to have a fit if I don't finish this on time.

77
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,439
Example three.

78
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,360
I almost had a fit when my boss told me I had to work this weekend.

79
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,740
Okay, great example.

80
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,160
So Erica, why don't you tell me what does it mean when you have a fit?

81
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:23,019
It means you get really angry and you can't control your emotions.

82
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:28,379
So maybe you start screaming and maybe some steam comes out of your ears.

83
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,759
Okay, that's having a fit.

84
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:31,339
Exactly.

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:31,980
Excellent.

86
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,740
Okay, let's take a look at our next word now.

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:35,980
Cut through.

88
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:37,439
Cut through.

89
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,699
Cut through.

90
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,639
When you cut through something it means you just go through.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,360
Yeah, quite simple.

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,259
It gives you the idea that you go through something quickly.

93
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,699
Quickly, so I can say let's cut through the park.

94
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,819
Yep, or let's cut through the backyard.

95
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,680
Okay, go through.

96
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,920
And this takes us to our last word for today.

97
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:04,160
Shortcut.

98
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,300
Shortcut.

99
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:06,800
Shortcut.

100
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,720
This is a really common word and not many people know about it.

101
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,339
Yeah, you're right.

102
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,019
It's two simple words that when you fit them together the meaning changes.

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,540
It's a great example of this real English we talk about.

104
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,860
And it means to take a shorter way somewhere.

105
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:25,740
Exactly.

106
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,779
So if I take a shortcut I go the short way.

107
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,319
Okay, so going back just a little bit to cut through.

108
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,980
If I cut through the park that's basically a shortcut.

109
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,360
Alright, now it's clear.

110
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:48,160
Now it's time to listen to our dialogue again, but this time it's going to be slower so then we can understand all these words that we just talked about.

111
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,959
Geez.

112
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:10,899
What's the rush?

113
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,040
Don't worry about it.

114
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:14,139
Just drive.

115
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,199
Oh no, the light is about to change.

116
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,660
Step on it.

117
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,439
Are you nuts?

118
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,220
I'm not going to run a red light.

119
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,699
Whatever.

120
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,300
Just turn right here.

121
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,319
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

122
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,600
Let's take a side street.

123
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:36,680
Go on.

124
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,279
Get out of our way.

125
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,379
Move.

126
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Move.

127
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:42,540
What's your problem?

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,779
Geez.

129
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,480
Having a fit is not going to help.

130
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:48,180
Here.

131
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,839
I know a shortcut.

132
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,680
Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

133
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:55,920
Let's go.

134
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,019
Let's go.

135
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,879
Watch out for that lady.

136
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm going as fast as I can.

137
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Yes.

138
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,699
We made it.

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,040
5.58.

140
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,300
Just before the library closes.

141
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,639
You're such a geek.

142
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,240
OK.

143
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,279
Well I think that was a lot more clear this time.

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,699
You know there was some great language in that dialogue and I would like to look at how we can put it together.

145
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,500
Putting it together.

146
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,480
OK.

147
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,019
So today I'm putting it together.

148
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,720
We have three phrases for you.

149
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,379
And we're going to show you how you can use these phrases like a native speaker.

150
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,019
OK.

151
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,220
So all of these phrases we heard in the dialogue.

152
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,939
Why don't we start with the first one.

153
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:43,560
Make a.

154
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,160
Make a.

155
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,620
So in the dialogue they say make a left here.

156
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:50,319
Yeah.

157
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,279
And we can extend this phrase to say make a right.

158
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,980
That would be the equivalent of saying turn left.

159
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,019
Or turn right.

160
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,660
Turn right.

161
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,160
And there's one more.

162
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,899
Make a U-turn.

163
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:03,759
Exactly.

164
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,459
That means turn the car 180 degrees all the way around.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,939
Make a U-turn.

166
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:10,959
So make a left.

167
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,660
Make a right.

168
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:12,560
Make a U-turn.

169
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,540
If you're ever in a taxi and you're telling the taxi driver where to go.

170
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,019
This is the perfect way.

171
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,060
Make a left here.

172
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,079
Make a right there.

173
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:20,699
OK.

174
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,360
So let's move to our second phrase and it is Are you nuts?

175
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,899
Are you nuts?

176
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,060
Are you nuts?

177
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,699
So this is a great way of saying Are you crazy?

178
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,059
Are you insane?

179
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,480
Are you mad?

180
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,279
So when would we use a phrase like this?

181
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,419
If somebody has a bad idea that you don't agree with you would say are you crazy or are you nuts?

182
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,059
So Marco let's stop this podcast right now.

183
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,240
Are you nuts?

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,340
OK.

185
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,179
I think that's a good example of how we can use this phrase.

186
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:52,659
Yes.

187
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,779
So are you nuts?

188
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,139
Are you insane?

189
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:56,480
Are you mad?

190
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,620
So let's listen to some examples of Are you nuts?

191
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,379
Example 1 You want to get married now?

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,779
Are you nuts?

193
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,539
You only met her three weeks ago.

194
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:21,000
Example 2 Are you nuts?

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,799
I'm not going to cheat on the exam.

196
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,299
What if I get caught?

197
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:29,620
So I think that's clear.

198
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,419
And now we can move to our third phrase which is Let's take a side street.

199
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,519
Let's take a side street.

200
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,159
Let's take a side street.

201
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,639
Again so if you're in a taxi this is a great way to suggest a route.

202
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,019
Or suggest a direction.

203
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,620
Right.

204
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,639
So we can take this phrase and extend it out with a few more words.

205
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:53,919
We might say let's take Wilson Avenue.

206
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:54,940
Right.

207
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,679
Or let's take the highway.

208
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,500
So let's take a side street.

209
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,600
Let's take Wilson Avenue.

210
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,139
Let's take the freeway.

211
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:03,659
OK.

212
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:12,559
So now let's take a listen to this dialogue a third time at its normal speed and now you can understand everything that's in this dialogue.

213
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,960
Example 3 Hurry up.

214
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:21,500
Get in.

215
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:22,179
I'm in.

216
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:23,120
Let's go.

217
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,740
OK.

218
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,759
Make a left here.

219
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:37,360
No wait.

220
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,539
I meant make a right.

221
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:39,740
Come on.

222
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,360
Speed up.

223
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,460
Jeez.

224
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,679
What's the rush?

225
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,500
Don't worry about it.

226
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,899
Just drive.

227
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,279
Oh no.

228
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,379
The light is about to change.

229
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,120
Step on it.

230
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
Are you nuts?

231
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,139
I'm not going to run a red light.

232
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:51,299
Whatever.

233
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,679
Just turn right here.

234
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,440
The freeway will be packed at this hour.

235
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,879
Let's take a side street.

236
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,120
Go on.

237
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,519
Get out of our way.

238
00:10:59,159 --> 00:10:59,639
Move.

239
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,379
Move.

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,279
What's your problem?

241
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:03,299
Jeez.

242
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,720
Having a fit is not going to help.

243
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,500
Here.

244
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,480
I know a shortcut.

245
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:11,259
Just go down here and we'll cut through Ashburn Heights.

246
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:11,899
Let's go.

247
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,600
Let's go.

248
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:13,940
Watch out for that lady.

249
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,299
I'm going as fast as I can.

250
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:20,240
Yes.

251
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,919
We made it.

252
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,019
558 just before the library closes.

253
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,000
You're such a geek.

254
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,960
Well this dialogue is all about driving, right?

255
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,600
Yes.

256
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,340
And in North America, where both of us are from, driving is everything.

257
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Everybody has a car.

258
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,700
When did you get a car?

259
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,419
Well, my car I got when I was like maybe 19.

260
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,039
Really?

261
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:49,399
But I learned how to drive and I was driving already by the age of 16.

262
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,379
Yeah, that's the thing.

263
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,899
In many countries, you have to wait until I think you're 18 to drive.

264
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,960
But in North America, everyone has a driver's license by the time they're 16 years old.

265
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:00,480
Yeah.

266
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:03,940
I guess everything is so far away that you need a car.

267
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,379
Yeah.

268
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,580
It's a lot less likely to have subways or trains to travel by in North America.

269
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,299
All right.

270
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,580
So now you have all the tools necessary to give directions the next time you're in a car or in a taxi.

271
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,320
Well everyone, I really hope you enjoyed this lesson.

272
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:31,100
Now I want to remind you all to come to our EnglishPod website at EnglishPod.com and here you'll find a lot of tools to help you understand our podcasts better.

273
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,279
So with that, until next time, this is goodbye.
