00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name's Erika.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So Marco, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm great.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm really happy to be back, ready to deliver another great podcast for all our listeners.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And we've got an intermediate lesson today about spending money.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, specifically spending money in a company.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to be listening to a business meeting as a company describes how they're spending money.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And they're actually looking at their profit and loss statement.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So that's kind of interesting.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a profit and loss statement?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah, sure.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, all companies come out with a profit and loss statement every year or every three months.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And it's basically a document that shows all the money that the company is spending and all the money that the company is earning.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So it's a document that outlines how much money the company makes and how much it spends.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Right.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So in the end, basically it'll tell you we're making money or we're losing money.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So we're going to be listening to some people discuss a profit and loss statement in just a moment.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But before we do that, it's time for vocabulary preview.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Vocabulary preview.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay, great.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So today on our vocabulary preview, we have two words for you.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So let's take a look at the first one.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Expenses.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Expenses.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Expenses.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Expenses.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So expenses are things that you have to spend money on regularly.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, for example, in a company, regular company expenses are salaries or office supplies or the phone bills, Internet bills.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And maybe in a household or a family, your expenses might be your food, perhaps your transportation or your rent or your heating bill.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So these are all things you spend money on regularly.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They're expenses.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Expenses.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Great.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's take a look at our second word through the roof.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Through the roof.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Through the roof.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Through the roof.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So when something is through the roof, it's really, really, really, really high.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Really high.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So, for example, we can talk about gas prices are through the roof lately.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah, that's totally true.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Gas prices have gone really high in the past couple of months.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So when we talk about through the roof, it means that the number is really high.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We typically use this word with numbers.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It also gives you the idea that the number has risen really quickly.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah, exactly.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So through the roof.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Through the roof.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
All right, Marco, do you think it's time for the dialogue?

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yep.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's listen to the dialogue.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As always, the first dialogue is going to be a little bit fast, so it might be a little bit difficult.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we will explain all of the key language in a minute.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
OK, so now the last point on our agenda.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Great.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
These numbers are off the charts.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's going on here?

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Look at these bills, for example.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just this month, we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OK, thank you.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll look into it.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The list goes on and on.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatment.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That will be all.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll take care of it.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Look at this one, sir.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Eight thousand dollars were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
OK, I get it.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
OK, so this accountant, she's pretty thorough, hey?

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
She's really persistent about her job, and the manager apparently is a little bit embarrassed.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I wonder why that could be.

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, we'll talk about that in a little while.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why don't we take a look at our language takeaway for today?

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
In today's language takeaway, we're going to look at three words.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And the first word is expenditures.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So expenditures sounds pretty close to expenses, right?

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So why don't we listen to some examples and see if we can understand.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Example one.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If elected president, I will increase expenditures on health and education by 12 percent.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Example two.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
We really need to control our travel expenditures.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
From now on, all managers will fly economy class.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Example three.

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because of the rise in oil prices, expenditures on food are higher than they have ever been.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So expenditures is the total amount of money that you're spending on something.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right, that's the total amount of money versus expenses is the things that you spend money on.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
OK, that's really clear.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Our next word is out of control.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Out of control.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So when something is out of control, it's crazy.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You can't control it.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Exactly, you can't stop it.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You can't stop it.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Out of control.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
OK, great.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now let's take a look at our last word for today.

114
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go over.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So go over is a pretty simple word.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand go over.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Example one.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I need to go over this report one last time to make sure there are no mistakes.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Example two.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can you help me go over my presentation?

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want to make sure it's perfect.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Example three.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go over these numbers one more time and make sure there are no mistakes.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah, this is a really common word and it basically means look at carefully.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, or review.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In English, we often find simple little words.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They fit together really well.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And you think, oh, they're so easy, like the word go over so easy.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But it's the way that they interact with each other that makes them...

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or it makes you sound much better.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Exactly.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So go over in this case.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We might say, let's go over the lesson.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go over the lesson.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, that sounds great.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, and that's a more natural way of saying something like that.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
OK, so we've taken a look at our language takeaways for today.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think it's time to listen to the dialogue one more time.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And this time the dialogue will be slower so we can understand and listen to all the words we just talked about.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
OK, so now the last point on our agenda.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Great.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's see.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
These numbers are off the charts.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What's going on here?

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Look at these bills, for example.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
OK, thank you.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll look into it.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The list goes on and on.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatments.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That will be all.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'll take care of it.

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Look at this one, sir.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Things.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
OK, I get it.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
OK, so I got it.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah, it's clear now.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue that I'd like to look at now in Fluency Builder.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Fluency Builder.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Great.

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So today on Fluency Builder, we have three words for you.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's start by looking at the first one.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Off the charts.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Off the charts.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Off the charts.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Off the charts.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So this word is very similar to through the roof.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Exactly.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It also means really high.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Right.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use off the charts in a different situation.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Example one.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oil prices have gone up and our costs are off the charts.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Example two.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Excellent job, Susan.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Your sales are off the charts this year.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Example three.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Our losses are off the charts.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's it.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No bonuses for anyone.

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So Marco, do you think I can change off the charts for through the roof in these examples?

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, you can.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Definitely.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can use off the charts or through the roof.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Both of them mean the same thing.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
OK, so two ways of saying really, really, really high.

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But they're very commonly used in a business setting.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yeah, that's true.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
OK, so this next word is a phrase that you can use if you want to tell somebody that you'll check something or you'll investigate something.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Right.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And we heard it in our dialogue.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So let's listen to the clip.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll look into it.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll look into it.

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So look into that.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That means I'll check something.

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, I'll see what's happening.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Does it mean you're going to take action?

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No, it doesn't.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
OK, so I think we've got another word that does mean you're going to take action.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll take care of it.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll take care of it.

210
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So this word means that you're going to do something about it.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll take care of it.

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I will take responsibility.

213
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Exactly.

214
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So I will do something about it.

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will investigate and I'll do it.

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Again, two great phrases.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll look into it.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll take care of it.

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
OK, so now let's listen to the dialogue a third time.

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's going to be at its normal speed, but now you have all the tools you need to understand it a lot better.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
OK, so now the last point on our agenda.

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Great.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

226
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
These numbers are off the charts.

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's going on here?

228
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Look at these bills, for example.

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
OK, thank you.

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll look into it.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The list goes on and on.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatment.

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That will be all.

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll take care of it.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Look at this one, sir.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
OK, I get it.

241
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, Marco, I guess one of the benefits of being an executive in a company, especially a large company, is you get a lot of amazing benefits.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
When you are a manager or a CEO of one of these big companies, you get a lot of great things like, I don't know, a private jet, maybe.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, that's nice.

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Or the company often pays for your house or for your car.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They'll give you a company car.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
They'll pay for your kids' or your children's tuition for high school.

249
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So there are school fees.

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
OK.

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And also I've heard about entertainment bonuses.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So you can go out to a restaurant, get the receipt and claim the expenses at work.

256
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Those are some great benefits, right?

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So, Marco, I'm curious to know what our listeners expenses are.

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yes, we definitely want to know what crazy expenses you have, for example.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, let's see.

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
My spending on Coke Zero has gone through the roof since we started this podcast.

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes, you spend a lot of money on Coke Zeros every week, right?

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, I probably have about, I don't know, 10 a week.

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, for example, I spend a lot on DVDs each week.

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I usually buy two or three movies.

265
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That is off the charts.

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That is off the charts for DVD spending.

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So we want to know what you spend your money on.

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Be sure to go into our community website and tell us what you spend money on.

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's right.

270
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can find us at EnglishPod.com and Marco and I are always there to respond to your questions and comments.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Great.

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So we'll see you there.

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And until then, it's goodbye.
