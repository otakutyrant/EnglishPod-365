00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,219
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,419 --> 00:00:05,240
My name's Erika.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,379
And I'm Marco.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,179
So Marco, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm great.

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:14,140
I'm really happy to be back, ready to deliver another great podcast for all our listeners.

7
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:14,980
That's right.

8
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,600
And we've got an intermediate lesson today about spending money.

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,300
Yeah, specifically spending money in a company.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,219
That's right.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,260
We're going to be listening to a business meeting as a company describes how they're spending money.

12
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,879
Right.

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,020
And they're actually looking at their profit and loss statement.

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,799
So that's kind of interesting.

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,140
Okay.

16
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,619
Well, Marco, can you tell us a little bit about a profit and loss statement?

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,659
Yeah, sure.

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,659
Well, all companies come out with a profit and loss statement every year or every three months.

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:52,979
And it's basically a document that shows all the money that the company is spending and all the money that the company is earning.

20
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:59,539
So it's a document that outlines how much money the company makes and how much it spends.

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,259
Right.

22
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,960
So in the end, basically it'll tell you we're making money or we're losing money.

23
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:04,560
Okay.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,719
So we're going to be listening to some people discuss a profit and loss statement in just a moment.

25
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,120
But before we do that, it's time for vocabulary preview.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,239
Vocabulary preview.

27
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:17,540
Okay, great.

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,060
So today on our vocabulary preview, we have two words for you.

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,400
So let's take a look at the first one.

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:25,880
Expenses.

31
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,540
Expenses.

32
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,620
Expenses.

33
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,840
Expenses.

34
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:33,879
So expenses are things that you have to spend money on regularly.

35
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,780
Right.

36
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:44,900
So, for example, in a company, regular company expenses are salaries or office supplies or the phone bills, Internet bills.

37
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:45,560
Okay.

38
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:55,959
And maybe in a household or a family, your expenses might be your food, perhaps your transportation or your rent or your heating bill.

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,159
So these are all things you spend money on regularly.

40
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,640
They're expenses.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,480
Expenses.

42
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:01,939
Great.

43
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,620
Let's take a look at our second word through the roof.

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
Through the roof.

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,319
Through the roof.

46
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,819
Through the roof.

47
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,979
So when something is through the roof, it's really, really, really, really high.

48
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:15,819
Really high.

49
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,699
So, for example, we can talk about gas prices are through the roof lately.

50
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,939
Yeah, that's totally true.

51
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,439
Gas prices have gone really high in the past couple of months.

52
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,460
So when we talk about through the roof, it means that the number is really high.

53
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:31,979
That's right.

54
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,439
We typically use this word with numbers.

55
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,139
It also gives you the idea that the number has risen really quickly.

56
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,159
Yeah, exactly.

57
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:40,300
Okay.

58
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,620
So through the roof.

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,400
Through the roof.

60
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,759
All right, Marco, do you think it's time for the dialogue?

61
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:45,360
Yep.

62
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,620
Let's listen to the dialogue.

63
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,400
As always, the first dialogue is going to be a little bit fast, so it might be a little bit difficult.

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,080
But don't worry if you don't understand everything, because we will explain all of the key language in a minute.

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,599
OK, so now the last point on our agenda.

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,919
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

67
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,280
Great.

68
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,620
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,759
These numbers are off the charts.

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,680
What's going on here?

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,900
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Look at these bills, for example.

73
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,819
Just this month, we've paid over twenty thousand dollars for hotel charges.

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,219
OK, thank you.

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll look into it.

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,460
The list goes on and on.

77
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,740
Here, this is a bill for five thousand dollars for spa treatment.

78
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,620
Thank you.

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,780
That will be all.

80
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,900
I'll take care of it.

81
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,080
Look at this one, sir.

82
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,960
Eight thousand dollars were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,099
OK, I get it.

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,319
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

85
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,939
OK, so this accountant, she's pretty thorough, hey?

86
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,139
She's really persistent about her job, and the manager apparently is a little bit embarrassed.

87
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,080
I wonder why that could be.

88
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,819
Well, we'll talk about that in a little while.

89
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,139
Why don't we take a look at our language takeaway for today?

90
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,339
In today's language takeaway, we're going to look at three words.

91
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,420
And the first word is expenditures.

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,319
So expenditures sounds pretty close to expenses, right?

93
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,399
It's pretty similar, but it has a little bit of a difference.

94
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
So why don't we listen to some examples and see if we can understand.

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
Example one.

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,779
If elected president, I will increase expenditures on health and education by 12 percent.

97
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,819
Example two.

98
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,160
We really need to control our travel expenditures.

99
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,240
From now on, all managers will fly economy class.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,180
Example three.

101
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:17,699
Because of the rise in oil prices, expenditures on food are higher than they have ever been.

102
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,519
So expenditures is the total amount of money that you're spending on something.

103
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:31,379
Right, that's the total amount of money versus expenses is the things that you spend money on.

104
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,720
OK, that's really clear.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,100
Our next word is out of control.

106
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,699
Out of control.

107
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,319
So when something is out of control, it's crazy.

108
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,800
You can't control it.

109
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,339
Exactly, you can't stop it.

110
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,199
You can't stop it.

111
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,220
Out of control.

112
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,439
OK, great.

113
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,779
Now let's take a look at our last word for today.

114
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,300
Go over.

115
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,220
So go over is a pretty simple word.

116
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,639
Why don't we listen to some examples so we can understand go over.

117
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:08,139
Example one.

118
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,019
I need to go over this report one last time to make sure there are no mistakes.

119
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,439
Example two.

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,100
Can you help me go over my presentation?

121
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:23,959
I want to make sure it's perfect.

122
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,379
Example three.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,360
Let's go over these numbers one more time and make sure there are no mistakes.

124
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,879
Yeah, this is a really common word and it basically means look at carefully.

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,060
Yeah, or review.

126
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,980
In English, we often find simple little words.

127
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,639
They fit together really well.

128
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,740
And you think, oh, they're so easy, like the word go over so easy.

129
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,680
Yeah.

130
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,160
But it's the way that they interact with each other that makes them...

131
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,600
Or it makes you sound much better.

132
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,439
Exactly.

133
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,339
So go over in this case.

134
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,079
We might say, let's go over the lesson.

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,139
Let's go over the lesson.

136
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,439
Yeah, that sounds great.

137
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,579
Yeah, and that's a more natural way of saying something like that.

138
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,879
OK, so we've taken a look at our language takeaways for today.

139
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,839
I think it's time to listen to the dialogue one more time.

140
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:27,600
And this time the dialogue will be slower so we can understand and listen to all the words we just talked about.

141
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,560
OK, so now the last point on our agenda.

142
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,560
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

143
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,699
Great.

144
00:07:48,579 --> 00:07:55,939
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

145
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
Let's see.

146
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,319
These numbers are off the charts.

147
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
What's going on here?

148
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:12,360
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,839
Look at these bills, for example.

150
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,939
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

151
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,939
OK, thank you.

152
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,379
I'll look into it.

153
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:28,540
The list goes on and on.

154
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,460
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatments.

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,799
Thank you.

156
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,960
That will be all.

157
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,399
I'll take care of it.

158
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,399
Look at this one, sir.

159
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,899
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Things.

160
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,899
OK, I get it.

161
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,840
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,860
OK, so I got it.

163
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,960
Yeah, it's clear now.

164
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:11,159
Yeah, and you know, I heard a lot of really great phrases in this dialogue that I'd like to look at now in Fluency Builder.

165
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:13,620
Fluency Builder.

166
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:14,759
Great.

167
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,279
So today on Fluency Builder, we have three words for you.

168
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,059
Let's start by looking at the first one.

169
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,620
Off the charts.

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,960
Off the charts.

171
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,440
Off the charts.

172
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,679
Off the charts.

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,019
So this word is very similar to through the roof.

174
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:28,820
Exactly.

175
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,840
It also means really high.

176
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,299
Right.

177
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,779
So let's listen to some examples of how we can use off the charts in a different situation.

178
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,960
Example one.

179
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,879
Oil prices have gone up and our costs are off the charts.

180
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,879
Example two.

181
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,460
Excellent job, Susan.

182
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,679
Your sales are off the charts this year.

183
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,440
Example three.

184
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,659
Our losses are off the charts.

185
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,580
That's it.

186
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,360
No bonuses for anyone.

187
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,799
So Marco, do you think I can change off the charts for through the roof in these examples?

188
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,360
Yeah, you can.

189
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,100
Definitely.

190
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,360
You can use off the charts or through the roof.

191
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,899
Both of them mean the same thing.

192
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,259
OK, so two ways of saying really, really, really high.

193
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:28,279
But they're very commonly used in a business setting.

194
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,080
Yeah, that's true.

195
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:37,759
OK, so this next word is a phrase that you can use if you want to tell somebody that you'll check something or you'll investigate something.

196
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:38,320
Right.

197
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,919
And we heard it in our dialogue.

198
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,740
So let's listen to the clip.

199
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,899
I'll look into it.

200
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,500
I'll look into it.

201
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,179
So look into that.

202
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,980
That means I'll check something.

203
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,740
Yeah, I'll see what's happening.

204
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:52,159
Yeah.

205
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,860
Does it mean you're going to take action?

206
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,559
No, it doesn't.

207
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,259
OK, so I think we've got another word that does mean you're going to take action.

208
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,360
I'll take care of it.

209
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,399
I'll take care of it.

210
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,879
So this word means that you're going to do something about it.

211
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,039
I'll take care of it.

212
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:12,500
I will take responsibility.

213
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,460
Exactly.

214
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,080
So I will do something about it.

215
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,179
I will investigate and I'll do it.

216
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,419
Yeah.

217
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,360
Again, two great phrases.

218
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,419
I'll look into it.

219
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:21,600
I'll take care of it.

220
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,799
OK, so now let's listen to the dialogue a third time.

221
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:30,860
It's going to be at its normal speed, but now you have all the tools you need to understand it a lot better.

222
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,679
OK, so now the last point on our agenda.

223
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,960
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

224
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:42,379
Great.

225
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:47,700
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

226
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,799
These numbers are off the charts.

227
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,740
What's going on here?

228
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:58,299
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

229
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,139
Look at these bills, for example.

230
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,899
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

231
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,299
OK, thank you.

232
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,100
I'll look into it.

233
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,539
The list goes on and on.

234
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:12,820
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatment.

235
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,679
Thank you.

236
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,860
That will be all.

237
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll take care of it.

238
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,159
Look at this one, sir.

239
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:22,039
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

240
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
OK, I get it.

241
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,379
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

242
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:41,759
Well, Marco, I guess one of the benefits of being an executive in a company, especially a large company, is you get a lot of amazing benefits.

243
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,419
Yes.

244
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:51,299
When you are a manager or a CEO of one of these big companies, you get a lot of great things like, I don't know, a private jet, maybe.

245
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,679
Well, that's nice.

246
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,080
Or the company often pays for your house or for your car.

247
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,480
They'll give you a company car.

248
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,919
They'll pay for your kids' or your children's tuition for high school.

249
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,399
So there are school fees.

250
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:08,759
Yeah.

251
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:09,100
Yeah.

252
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:09,419
OK.

253
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,679
And also I've heard about entertainment bonuses.

254
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Yeah.

255
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:19,720
So you can go out to a restaurant, get the receipt and claim the expenses at work.

256
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,679
Those are some great benefits, right?

257
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,279
So, Marco, I'm curious to know what our listeners expenses are.

258
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,620
Yes, we definitely want to know what crazy expenses you have, for example.

259
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,179
Well, let's see.

260
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:39,320
My spending on Coke Zero has gone through the roof since we started this podcast.

261
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,759
Yes, you spend a lot of money on Coke Zeros every week, right?

262
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:46,159
Yeah, I probably have about, I don't know, 10 a week.

263
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:51,940
Well, for example, I spend a lot on DVDs each week.

264
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,779
I usually buy two or three movies.

265
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,700
That is off the charts.

266
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,779
That is off the charts for DVD spending.

267
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,419
So we want to know what you spend your money on.

268
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,679
Be sure to go into our community website and tell us what you spend money on.

269
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,279
That's right.

270
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:14,340
You can find us at EnglishPod.com and Marco and I are always there to respond to your questions and comments.

271
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,159
Great.

00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,779
So we'll see you there.

273
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,379
And until then, it's goodbye.
