00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:08,279
EnglishPod.com Okay, so now the last point on our agenda.

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,560
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:11,980
Great!

4
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:17,300
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

5
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:20,399
These numbers are off the charts.

6
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:21,339
What's going on here?

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,899
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

8
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:29,739
Look at these bills, for example.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,500
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,479
Oh, okay.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:35,899
Thank you.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,719
I'll look into it.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,899
The list goes on and on.

14
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:42,460
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatments.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,280
Thank you.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,460
That will be all.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,600
I'll take care of it.

18
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,759
Look at this one, sir.

19
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,640
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,780
Okay, I get it.

21
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:58,859
Music.
