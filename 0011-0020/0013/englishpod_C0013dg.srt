00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, so now the last point on our agenda.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Jill, let's go over the profit and loss statement.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Great!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, the main issue here, as you can see, is that our expenses are through the roof.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
These numbers are off the charts.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's going on here?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, sir, the company expenditures on entertainment and travel are out of control.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Look at these bills, for example.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just this month, we've paid over $20,000 for hotel charges.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, okay.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll look into it.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The list goes on and on.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here, this is a bill for $5,000 for spa treatments.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That will be all.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll take care of it.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Look at this one, sir.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
$8,000 were expensed in one night at a place called Wild Thing.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, I get it.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you for your very thorough analysis.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Music.
