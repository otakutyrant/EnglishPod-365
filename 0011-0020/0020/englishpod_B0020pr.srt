1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,719
Well, hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,740
My name's Erica.

3
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:06,919
And I'm Marco.

4
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:08,679
So, Marco, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,240
I'm doing great and I'm really looking forward to our lesson because we're going to the eye doctor today.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,019
Okay, so we've got an elementary lesson about going to the eye doctor.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,719
Yes.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,839
Well, let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,280
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,960
We have three words today in our vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,299
All three words come from our dialogue.

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,399
Our first word is struggle.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,219
Struggle.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,320
Struggle.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,600
So, Marco, when I struggle to do something, what does that mean?

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,700
It means it's difficult.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,920
It means that you have a hard time so you can't really do it very quickly.

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,659
So you have to try really hard.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,100
You have to try really hard.

20
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,799
Yeah, to do something that's difficult.

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,280
Yes.

22
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,320
Okay, our next word is blurry.

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:58,619
Blurry.

24
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,719
Blurry.

25
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,840
Blurry.

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,600
B-L-U-R-R-Y.

27
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:04,340
Blurry.

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,319
Whenever something is blurry, you can't really see it well.

29
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:08,299
It's not clear.

30
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:08,680
Right.

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,299
That's right.

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,760
Everything will be blurry.

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

34
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:14,879
And our final word is prescription.

35
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:15,879
Prescription.

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,120
Prescription.

37
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:23,420
Often when you go to the doctor and you need some medicine, he writes out a prescription.

38
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,920
Right.

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,799
A little paper that says all the medicine that you need and then you can go to the drugstore and buy it.

40
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,319
Exactly.

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,739
Okay, so those three words you'll hear in today's dialogue and I think it's time we listen to the dialogue.

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,079
Hello, Arthur.

43
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,159
What seems to be the problem?

44
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,299
Hey, Doc.

45
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,760
Well, I think I might need glasses.

46
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:52,299
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

47
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,739
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

48
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,340
Sounds like you might be farsighted.

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,019
Okay then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

50
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:15,240
X-B-R-3, question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's the peace sign.

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,360
Wow.

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,620
Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

53
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,319
Yeah, I know.

54
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,340
My vision is really blurry at times.

55
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,719
Okay then, head over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

56
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,800
Thanks, Doc.

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,680
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

58
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,979
Well, this guy really has poor vision, hey?

59
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,139
Well, actually, you know what, I've walked into the bathroom, the men's bathroom, actually, instead of the women's bathroom and that's not because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

60
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,659
It's because you weren't paying attention.

61
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,379
That's true.

62
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
Okay, let's take a look today at our language takeaway.

63
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,259
The first word on our language takeaway for today is 20-20 vision.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,120
20-20 vision.

65
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,860
20-20 vision.

66
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,020
If I have 20-20 vision...

67
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,800
It means that you have perfect vision.

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,159
Which I do not have.

69
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,900
No, me neither, so I usually wear glasses as well.

70
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,060
But yeah, people that have 20-20 vision don't need glasses.

71
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,259
They can see clearly and perfectly.

72
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,740
Next word is farsighted.

73
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,819
Farsighted.

74
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,860
Farsighted.

75
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,060
Farsighted.

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
So, if I'm farsighted, I can't see very well, right?

77
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:38,719
If you're farsighted, you can see things that are near.

78
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,360
So you can see things that are far away.

79
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,300
But things that are close are blurry.

80
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:44,860
Okay.

81
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,080
And the opposite would be?

82
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:46,960
Nearsighted.

83
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,000
And which is?

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,680
You can see things that are close well.

85
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,840
But not far.

86
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:52,259
Yeah.

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,479
Okay.

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,900
Farsighted and nearsighted.

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,620
Okay, so our next word is make out.

90
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:01,159
Make out.

91
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:02,159
Make out.

92
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,439
Make out.

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,080
Make out.

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,740
That's kind of a funny little phrase.

95
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,900
Let's listen to a few examples of this phrase so we can understand how it's used.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,740
Example one.

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,600
I can't make out what this says.

98
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,180
The writing is too small.

99
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:22,879
Example two.

100
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,139
If you look carefully, you can almost make out a few of the stars in the sky.

101
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,899
Example three.

102
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:37,379
Can you see what's written on the sign there?

103
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,180
No, I can't quite make it out.

104
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,279
Okay, so basically make out is to see clearly.

105
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,100
Exactly.

106
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,360
Make out.

107
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,220
To see.

108
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,160
Okay.

109
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,120
And our last word for language takeaway today is blind as a bat.

110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,720
Blind as a bat.

111
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,800
Blind as a bat.

112
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,800
So this is a really funny sounding expression.

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,980
One of these weird English idioms.

114
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,579
Yeah, it's a really common expression that just means that you can't see.

115
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:08,579
Exactly.

116
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,480
So it's not like you actually are blind, right?

117
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,959
But you just really can't see very well.

118
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,459
Okay.

119
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,040
Alright, we saw four great words today in our language takeaway.

120
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,639
Now I think we can listen to our dialogue another time.

121
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,279
But this time it's going to be slower so we can pick up all these great words that we just talked about.

122
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:31,639
Hello, Arthur.

123
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,139
What seems to be the problem?

124
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,519
Hey, Doc.

125
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,259
Well, I think I might need glasses.

126
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,459
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

127
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:46,660
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

128
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
Sounds like you may be farsighted.

129
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,339
Okay, then.

130
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:53,959
Cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

131
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:07,459
X, E, R, 3, question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's a peace sign.

132
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:09,339
Wow.

133
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,860
Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

134
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,740
Yeah, I know.

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,199
My vision is really blurry at times.

136
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,120
Okay, then.

137
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,819
Head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

138
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,000
Thanks, Doc.

139
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,060
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

140
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:35,060
Alright, great stuff on our dialogue and with this we can start now with putting it together.

141
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,199
Putting it together.

142
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:46,420
So we saw a couple useful phrases in this dialogue and I think we can show you how to use these phrases in a few different ways.

143
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,519
Right.

144
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,959
The first one that we have today is what seems to be.

145
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:55,199
So we heard in the dialogue, the doctor said...

146
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,720
What seems to be the problem?

147
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,180
We can use this same expression in a number of different ways.

148
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:01,959
Let's listen.

149
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:03,800
Example one.

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,560
What seems to be the problem?

151
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Example two.

152
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,620
What seems to be the matter?

153
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:15,800
Example three.

154
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,720
What seems to be the trouble?

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:27,699
Okay, so with these examples we can see how we can use the phrase what seems to be in many different ways.

156
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:30,019
Yeah, it's a great way of asking what's the problem?

157
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,139
So now let's take a look at another phrase.

158
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,980
We heard in the dialogue the doctor said head on over to the other room.

159
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,699
Right, and with this phrase head on we can combine it with other prepositions to indicate another place.

160
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,420
Exactly, let's hear three examples.

161
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,800
Example one.

162
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,079
Head on in.

163
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,300
Example two.

164
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,500
Head on out.

165
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,899
Example three.

166
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,199
Head on up.

167
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,040
Okay, so for example we can say head on into the house, it's gonna rain soon.

168
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,779
Or we can say hey guys, let's head on out to the park.

169
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:16,839
Or I can also say head on up to my room, I'll be there in a second.

170
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,439
Great, those are some cool phrases.

171
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:20,860
Right, and they're real useful.

172
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,259
So why don't we listen to our dialogue and maybe we'll hear them again.

173
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,800
Hello Arthur, what seems to be the problem?

174
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,360
Hey Doc, well I think I might need glasses.

175
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,899
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

176
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,320
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

177
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,759
Sounds like you might be far-sighted.

178
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,460
Okay then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

179
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:55,240
Hmm, X, V, R, 3, question mark.

180
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,840
And I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's the peace sign.

181
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,220
Wow, Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

182
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:07,940
Yeah, I know, my vision is really blurry at times.

183
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay then, head over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

184
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,379
Thanks Doc.

185
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,279
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

186
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,940
Okay, so talking about going to the eye doctor today, I have a question for our listeners.

187
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,039
A challenge for our listeners.

188
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,820
What's it called when you can't distinguish colors?

189
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,200
So like when you can't tell the difference between red and blue and green.

190
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,139
Right, so what is that condition called?

191
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,500
There's like a technical term, we want the technical term.

192
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,919
We want the technical term.

193
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,639
So we'll be looking for it on our comments page and be sure to, if you know the answer, post it.

194
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,600
