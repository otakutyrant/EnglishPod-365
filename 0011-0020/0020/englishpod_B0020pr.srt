1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Well, hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name's Erica.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, Marco, how are you doing today?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm doing great and I'm really looking forward to our lesson because we're going to the eye doctor today.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay, so we've got an elementary lesson about going to the eye doctor.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, let's get started then with our vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have three words today in our vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All three words come from our dialogue.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Our first word is struggle.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Struggle.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Struggle.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, Marco, when I struggle to do something, what does that mean?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It means it's difficult.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It means that you have a hard time so you can't really do it very quickly.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So you have to try really hard.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to try really hard.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, to do something that's difficult.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, our next word is blurry.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Blurry.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Blurry.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Blurry.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
B-L-U-R-R-Y.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Blurry.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Whenever something is blurry, you can't really see it well.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's not clear.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Right.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Everything will be blurry.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And our final word is prescription.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Prescription.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Prescription.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Often when you go to the doctor and you need some medicine, he writes out a prescription.

38
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Right.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A little paper that says all the medicine that you need and then you can go to the drugstore and buy it.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Exactly.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, so those three words you'll hear in today's dialogue and I think it's time we listen to the dialogue.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hello, Arthur.

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What seems to be the problem?

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hey, Doc.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, I think I might need glasses.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sounds like you might be farsighted.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Okay then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:15,000
X-B-R-3, question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's the peace sign.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wow.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, I know.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My vision is really blurry at times.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay then, head over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thanks, Doc.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Well, this guy really has poor vision, hey?

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, actually, you know what, I've walked into the bathroom, the men's bathroom, actually, instead of the women's bathroom and that's not because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's because you weren't paying attention.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's true.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, let's take a look today at our language takeaway.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The first word on our language takeaway for today is 20-20 vision.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
20-20 vision.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
20-20 vision.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If I have 20-20 vision...

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It means that you have perfect vision.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Which I do not have.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No, me neither, so I usually wear glasses as well.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But yeah, people that have 20-20 vision don't need glasses.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
They can see clearly and perfectly.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Next word is farsighted.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Farsighted.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Farsighted.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Farsighted.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So, if I'm farsighted, I can't see very well, right?

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If you're farsighted, you can see things that are near.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you can see things that are far away.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But things that are close are blurry.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And the opposite would be?

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nearsighted.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And which is?

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can see things that are close well.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But not far.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Farsighted and nearsighted.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, so our next word is make out.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Make out.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Make out.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Make out.

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Make out.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's kind of a funny little phrase.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's listen to a few examples of this phrase so we can understand how it's used.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Example one.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't make out what this says.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The writing is too small.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Example two.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you look carefully, you can almost make out a few of the stars in the sky.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Example three.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can you see what's written on the sign there?

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, I can't quite make it out.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, so basically make out is to see clearly.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Exactly.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Make out.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
To see.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And our last word for language takeaway today is blind as a bat.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Blind as a bat.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Blind as a bat.

112
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So this is a really funny sounding expression.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
One of these weird English idioms.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, it's a really common expression that just means that you can't see.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Exactly.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So it's not like you actually are blind, right?

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But you just really can't see very well.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Alright, we saw four great words today in our language takeaway.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now I think we can listen to our dialogue another time.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But this time it's going to be slower so we can pick up all these great words that we just talked about.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hello, Arthur.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What seems to be the problem?

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, Doc.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, I think I might need glasses.

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Sounds like you may be farsighted.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay, then.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:07,000
X, E, R, 3, question mark, and I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's a peace sign.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow.

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, I know.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
My vision is really blurry at times.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, then.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Thanks, Doc.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Alright, great stuff on our dialogue and with this we can start now with putting it together.

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Putting it together.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So we saw a couple useful phrases in this dialogue and I think we can show you how to use these phrases in a few different ways.

143
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The first one that we have today is what seems to be.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So we heard in the dialogue, the doctor said...

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What seems to be the problem?

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We can use this same expression in a number of different ways.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's listen.

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Example one.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What seems to be the problem?

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Example two.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What seems to be the matter?

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Example three.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What seems to be the trouble?

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, so with these examples we can see how we can use the phrase what seems to be in many different ways.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, it's a great way of asking what's the problem?

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So now let's take a look at another phrase.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We heard in the dialogue the doctor said head on over to the other room.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Right, and with this phrase head on we can combine it with other prepositions to indicate another place.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Exactly, let's hear three examples.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Example one.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Head on in.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Example two.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Head on out.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Example three.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Head on up.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, so for example we can say head on into the house, it's gonna rain soon.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Or we can say hey guys, let's head on out to the park.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Or I can also say head on up to my room, I'll be there in a second.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Great, those are some cool phrases.

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right, and they're real useful.

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue and maybe we'll hear them again.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hello Arthur, what seems to be the problem?

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hey Doc, well I think I might need glasses.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm getting headaches and I really struggle to see things that are far away.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But I've always had 20-20 vision.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sounds like you might be far-sighted.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay then, cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hmm, X, V, R, 3, question mark.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And I can't quite make out the other symbol but I think it's the peace sign.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Wow, Arthur, you're as blind as a bat.

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, I know, my vision is really blurry at times.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay then, head over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thanks Doc.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Arthur, that's the bathroom.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, so talking about going to the eye doctor today, I have a question for our listeners.

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A challenge for our listeners.

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What's it called when you can't distinguish colors?

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So like when you can't tell the difference between red and blue and green.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Right, so what is that condition called?

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There's like a technical term, we want the technical term.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We want the technical term.

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So we'll be looking for it on our comments page and be sure to, if you know the answer, post it.

194
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
At EnglishPod.com.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
