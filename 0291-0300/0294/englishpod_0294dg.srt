00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com I've never heard of Amlion College.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Could you?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Of course, sir.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let me give you a brief overview.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Amlion College is located in the center of New York City.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects and eighty percent of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And last year Amlion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Interesting.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And what about the tuition fees then?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You'll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay, well...

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And did I mention our on-campus housing?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Sounds good!

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sir, you got the wrong flyer!

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Sir!

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sir!
