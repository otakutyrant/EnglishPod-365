00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:09,619
EnglishPod.com I've never heard of Amlion College.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:10,759
Could you?

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,779
Of course, sir.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,160
Let me give you a brief overview.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,539
Amlion College is located in the center of New York City.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,100
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects and eighty percent of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,859
And last year Amlion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:27,920
Interesting.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,820
And what about the tuition fees then?

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,219
You'll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.

11
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:37,380
Okay, well...

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,079
And did I mention our on-campus housing?

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,960
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,679
Sounds good!

15
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:47,640
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

16
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,539
Sir, you got the wrong flyer!

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,280
Sir!

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,320
Sir!
