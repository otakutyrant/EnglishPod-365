00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:03,839
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:09,779
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson about education and university.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,419
That's right.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,019
Today we're trying to find a university.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:17,660
We want to get some information about how much it costs and all that sort of stuff.

7
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:20,899
So why don't we jump into the dialogue and see what's going on today.

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,480
I've never heard of Amlion College.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,620
Could you?

10
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:31,640
Of course, sir.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,060
Let me give you a brief overview.

12
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,420
Amlion College is located in the center of New York City.

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,979
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects and 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

14
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,780
And last year Amlion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,820
Interesting.

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,700
And what about the tuition fees then?

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,119
You'll be looking at somewhere around $15,000 per semester.

18
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,460
Okay.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,960
Well… And did I mention our on-campus housing?

20
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,859
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as $3,000 per month.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Sounds good.

22
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,519
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,400
Sir.

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,439
You got the wrong flyer.

25
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,180
Sir.

26
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:16,180
Sir.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,439
All right.

28
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:18,799
We're back.

29
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:22,000
So now let's take a look at some language on Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,120
Language Takeaway.

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,439
So first up, Marco, we've got this word transferable.

32
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:39,299
In the dialogue, the representative from Amlion College said that 80% of the courses are transferable to other universities.

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,219
Okay.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,359
So before we talk about transferable, what is the difference here?

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,439
We have two words, college and university.

36
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:52,420
So why is he saying that you can transfer your courses from Amlion College to another university?

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,879
Well, college and university are words that we use in English to describe higher education.

38
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,079
That means education after high school.

39
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:08,639
And a college is usually just for bachelor students, students who are doing their first four years out of high school.

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:20,560
But a university is a it's usually a larger institution that has bachelor's degree students as well as master's degree students and Ph.D.

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,020
candidates.

42
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:31,819
And so while a college is for 18 to 22 year olds, a university can have students of all ages who are doing sometimes very advanced degrees like postdoctoral work.

43
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:32,419
Okay.

44
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,340
Very interesting.

45
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:41,180
And so this is why the person mentions that 80% of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,039
So transferable means that you can transfer, you can move to another university.

47
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,800
So everything that you've studied, you can take with you.

48
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,439
That's right.

49
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:58,300
So a lot of people like to start at a college or vice versa, like to start at a big university and transfer to a college.

50
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,719
And so it's important to know that your courses can be transferred as well.

51
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:10,900
So if I studied Spanish for two years, I can transfer that that I can transfer those courses to my new school.

52
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,199
Right.

53
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,520
So you don't have to start over.

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,919
Right.

55
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,500
Okay.

56
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,000
Very good.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,199
And well, obviously, one of the big questions when you're picking a university is the tuition fee.

58
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:28,000
So tuition is the amount of money it costs to attend a university for usually a year.

59
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,900
Tuition fees is the actual money you have to pay.

60
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,360
So you can say, I can't afford my tuition fees this year, so I will be getting a part time job.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,919
Okay.

62
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,500
And so this is what tuition fees are.

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,400
In school, you call it tuition.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,580
You don't say how much it costs.

65
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,580
You ask, what is the tuition?

66
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,360
What's the tuition?

67
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:48,699
Exactly.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,419
Okay.

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,400
And he mentioned that it was around fifteen thousand dollars per semester.

70
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:55,300
So this is interesting.

71
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:56,879
Is this the year?

72
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,000
No, a semester is half of an academic year.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,819
All right.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,539
So an academic year is usually September to May or June, and a semester is half of that.

75
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:15,759
So first semester or fall semester is the study period between September and December or January.

76
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,360
That's right.

77
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:16,660
Okay.

78
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:26,040
So basically, what we could deduce is that this university costs fifteen thousand dollars per semester or about thirty thousand per year.

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,560
That's right.

80
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,019
Okay.

81
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:27,500
Very good.

82
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,220
And well, he also mentioned about the on campus housing.

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:33,279
All right.

84
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,199
So on campus is pretty straightforward.

85
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:40,980
It means that this housing option where you live and sleep is on the campus.

86
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,339
And a university campus is not one building.

87
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:45,100
It's many, many buildings together.

88
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,379
Sometimes there are classrooms and there are laboratories and there's a cafeteria.

89
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:52,339
But there's also housing.

90
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,699
And most housing comes in one style.

91
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,779
What's the style they mentioned in today's dialogue?

92
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,620
A dorm.

93
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:03,040
This is where university students usually live if they live on campus.

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,779
They have dorms.

95
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,300
So dorm is short for dormitory.

96
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:16,079
And it basically means that it's an apartment building for students or even sometimes workers.

97
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,959
That's very close to where they'll be studying or working.

98
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,240
So the difference.

99
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,220
What is the difference between a dorm and an apartment?

100
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:24,600
Well, I can give you an example.

101
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,240
Some dorms are very fancy, but my dorm at university was very simple.

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,019
So I lived in one bedroom with another girl.

103
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,579
There were two beds and no bathroom.

104
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:43,160
And so everyone in that that floor of the building shared bathrooms and the bathrooms were, you know, there's six showers and four toilets or whatever.

105
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,500
Okay.

106
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,000
Very good.

107
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,300
Yeah.

108
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,500
I think this is the main thing with a dorm is usually you don't have a kitchen.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,079
You don't have usually a your own bathroom.

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,779
And so it's just basically a room and a bedroom.

111
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,040
And then you share everything else with people.

112
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,120
All right.

113
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,839
Very good.

114
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,240
A lot of great things related to college.

115
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,280
I think this is very good vocab for you, especially if you're considering going to college or something like that.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,899
Especially if you're considering going to college or maybe you want to continue your studies.

117
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:12,540
So why don't we go back?

118
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,379
Let's listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

119
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,319
And what about the tuition fees then?

120
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,899
You'll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand U.S.

121
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,699
dollars per semester.

122
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:50,899
Okay.

123
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:51,379
Well.

124
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,540
And did I mention our on campus housing?

125
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,459
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month.

126
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,139
Sounds good.

127
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,139
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

128
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,819
Sir, you got the wrong flyer, sir, sir.

129
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:13,660
All right, we're back.

130
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,500
So now let's take a look at these three phrases we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

131
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:19,860
Fluency Builder.

132
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:30,879
So again, when the person who was speaking for this college was describing it, they said that the school covers a wide range of academic subjects.

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,019
Now, this phrase wide range is something you'll hear in a lot of different contexts.

134
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,139
What does it mean, Marco?

135
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:36,740
That's right.

136
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,759
It means that they have a variety, a very big variety of subjects.

137
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,980
So they don't only focus, for example, on business.

138
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,000
They may have arts, they may have engineering, business, etc.

139
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:57,519
So if you are studying at a university and they offer one course, they offer English, is that a wide range of subjects?

140
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,180
No, no, that's not a wide range.

141
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:04,279
So basically a wide range of subjects would be that you can have many, many, many choices.

142
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:04,980
Okay.

143
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:10,300
Well, after that, we also had a great phrase when we were discussing tuition fees.

144
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,980
So the visitor asked, what about the tuition fees?

145
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,360
And the answer was, you'll be looking at somewhere around 15,000 US dollars.

146
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,300
Now, you'll be looking at is a very, very strange phrase, right?

147
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,779
Well, it's not strange, but it might sound strange to non-native English speakers.

148
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,040
Right.

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,899
It's actually a very common phrase, especially when you're talking to salesmen.

150
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,519
They don't want to say you'll have to pay or you have to pay or anything like this.

151
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,320
They'll say, well, you'll be looking at somewhere around 15,000 dollars.

152
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,080
And that means you are expected to pay this amount of money.

153
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,379
But they don't really say pay.

154
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:50,700
So this is the key thing.

155
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:51,679
All right.

156
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,679
So this is the price.

157
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,840
This is the price tag.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,960
And this is something that, like you're saying, salespeople say so that you don't have to say, well, the price of this is 30,000 dollars.

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,320
So another good context for this phrase would be like a car dealership.

160
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:11,460
If I'm buying a car and I see a beautiful new Ford Mustang and I say, well, how much does this cost?

161
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,960
What would you as the car dealer say?

162
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,379
I'll say, well, you'll be looking at around 30,000 dollars.

163
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,240
I don't know.

164
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,960
That's right.

165
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,080
So this is a way of saying you'll have to pay.

166
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,740
And, well, the guy wasn't really convinced.

167
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,059
I think it was kind of expensive because dorms were also three thousand dollars per month.

168
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,879
So he was like, well, sounds good.

169
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,740
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

170
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:38,879
All right.

171
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,159
So this phrase sounds good is something that English speakers use all the time.

172
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,320
I personally use it very, very often.

173
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,320
And it's another way of saying OK.

174
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,919
Yeah.

175
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,259
So if you agree with someone, you say sounds good.

176
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,759
So should we meet at seven for the movie tonight?

177
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,399
Yeah, sure.

178
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:54,879
Sounds good.

179
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,440
All right.

180
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,759
It's another way of saying yes.

181
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:57,460
Good.

182
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,179
OK.

183
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,860
Very well.

184
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,379
That's right.

185
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,799
So sounds good.

186
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,179
Great stuff.

187
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,159
Why don't we take a break?

188
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,100
Let's listen to everything one more time and we'll be back in a bit.

189
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,639
I've never heard of M Line College.

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,799
Could you?

191
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,820
Of course, sir.

192
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,259
Let me give you a brief overview.

193
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,559
M Line College is located in the center of New York City.

194
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:28,120
The school covers a wide range of academic subjects, and 80 percent of the courses are transferable to other state universities.

195
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,899
And last year, M Line College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.

196
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:32,980
Interesting.

197
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,879
And what about the tuition fees then?

198
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,480
You'll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand U.S.

199
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,259
dollars per semester.

200
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,039
OK.

201
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,120
Well… And did I mention our on-campus housing?

202
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,019
Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month.

203
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,720
Sounds good.

204
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,700
Well, I'll just grab one of your flyers.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,620
Sir, you got the wrong flyer.

206
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,340
Sir.

207
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,379
Sir!

208
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:03,820
All right.

209
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,139
So universities in the United States, they're infamous for being very expensive.

210
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

211
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,730
And so we discussed the difference between colleges and universities.

212
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,659
But I think it's important to also talk about the difference between public and private schools.

213
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:28,779
Public schools are schools that are paid for by the government or that are subsidized.

214
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,159
So the government pays part of them.

215
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,279
And these are schools that tend to be cheaper than private schools.

216
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,600
So private schools can be as much as fifty thousand dollars for one year of study.

217
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,840
So, for example, the famous ones like Harvard or Stanford, those are private schools.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,759
Those are private schools.

219
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:50,120
But the University of California is a public institution.

220
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:54,440
The University of Illinois, for example, is another public institution.

221
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,159
So there are many different options in the United States.

222
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,480
I think usually the state universities have the name of the state in them.

223
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,320
So University of Florida is probably State University.

224
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:05,720
That's right.

225
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,120
We have to be careful because the University of Pennsylvania is a private university.

226
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:10,500
Oh, really?

227
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,100
Yeah.

228
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,620
It's an Ivy League school.

229
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,620
So it's one of the oldest schools in America.

230
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,980
And it's like Harvard or Yale.

231
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,120
It's very, very high quality.

232
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,940
This is something that they always mention when talking about universities in the states.

233
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,259
They always say it's an Ivy League school, just like you said right now.

234
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,679
What does it mean if a university is Ivy League?

235
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,399
Well, a league is just a group, right?

236
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,740
And so some of the first universities in the United States formed this group called the Ivy League.

237
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,259
And I think it used to have to do with the sports.

238
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,379
These teams would play each other in sports, but I could be wrong.

239
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,659
Anyway, these were in the 18th century, these are schools for men.

240
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,879
And there were seven, I think, seven Ivy League schools for men.

241
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,799
And then there were the sister schools for women.

242
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,799
Yeah, like Wellesley, Radcliffe, these are the sister schools.

243
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,139
And so nowadays both men and women can go to all these universities.

244
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,360
And so we just talk about them as the Ivy Leagues.

245
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:11,500
And the Ivy League schools that are most famous are Harvard, Yale, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, things like that.

246
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,200
So talking about universities and colleges, I have heard also the community college.

247
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,159
Yeah, that can be a lot more affordable.

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,200
Because it's a community college, it's usually something you go to back near your home.

249
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,039
Because colleges and universities, sometimes people travel very, very far to go to these schools.

250
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,299
But community colleges are available to people in your own community.

251
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:38,799
And you can take night classes, you can do a lot of different things with them.

252
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,919
They're great resources, they're a lot more affordable than other schools.

253
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:49,620
And a lot of people like to go to them because they don't have to pay these expensive fees for housing like dorms or for travel.

254
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,820
And they're a great option for people.

255
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:56,200
So community colleges, colleges and universities are the major distinctions.

256
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:05,940
There is a lot to talk about on this subject, especially if you're a student or you're a professional, considering doing a master's abroad or you want to go to the States or Canada to study.

257
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,279
There's a lot of things to take into consideration.

258
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,720
So this is a great topic.

259
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,360
