00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and we have a delicious Italian food lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We are at an Italian restaurant, and we are ordering food.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So this is going to be very helpful next time you are at an Italian restaurant with your friends and you're ordering up some dishes.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Good evening, ladies.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
My name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
May I take your order?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Do you have any recommendations?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Mmm, I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of course, ma'am.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And for you?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I, uh, I'll have the horse tripe.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All right, we're back, and now let's take a look at all those delicious Italian dishes on Language Takeaway.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Language Takeaway.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So first of all, we have two different kinds of sauce, really.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The first is cream mushroom.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So what's a cream sauce, Marco?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A cream mushroom sauce.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So basically, this is cream from, like, milk, and you have mushrooms in it, and it's, I don't know, I think everyone has seen it.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a very thick white sauce.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It has little slices of mushrooms in it.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And it's kind of sweet.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right, and so oftentimes you see there's cream sauces, which are white, and tomato sauces, which are red.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And this here is a cream sauce, so it's white, and it's got chunks of mushroom in it, very tasty.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And the waiter also offered prawn with the pasta.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So what is a prawn?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Prawn fettuccine.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So prawn is like a big, it's like a word for shrimp.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I always think of jumbo prawns, which are these big, big, big shrimps.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So they're basically the same thing.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Shrimp and prawn are basically the same.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right, and they're a seafood that when they get cooked, they curl, and so they look like a circle, but they're pinkish or red.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They're very tasty.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, so now let's take a look at the different types of pasta.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So we have three different types of pasta that the waiter suggested, so the first one is...

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, we're gonna say all three in the American way, but I'm gonna tell you, the Italian way is quite different, so I'll say that afterwards.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The first is penne.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, so this is a type of pasta.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What does it look like?

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It is like a small tube, so maybe three centimeters long, and it is round, and it has a hole in the middle, and so it's a kind of pasta.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And what about the fettuccine?

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So fettuccine is a long noodle, but it's flat.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not round, it's flat, fettuccine.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So it kinda looks like a shoelace.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, it's long and flat.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay, and then we have spaghetti, which I think many people know, and this is probably the most popular one.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right, spaghetti is very long, just like fettuccine, but it's very, very thin and round.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So it kinda looks like maybe a pencil, a very long pencil.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But very thin, more like hair, actually.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Melted hair, okay.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, and there are thin kinds, so they have a special name, but this is just a normal pasta that you will see everywhere, it's very long, and you can twirl it, you can spin it around your fork.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Around your fork.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay, so that's what we have, we have penne, fettuccine, and spaghetti.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, the other woman ended up ordering horse tripe, now this is also another Italian dish, what is this exactly?

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, horse is the animal, so this is tripe that comes from a horse, but tripe is a certain part of the animal that we, it's a food name, actually.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So when we eat the stomach lining, the part of the stomach that goes around the stomach, it's kind of squishy, soft, that is called tripe, and you can have tripe from many different animals, like cows or pigs, but in this case it's horse tripe, so it's basically that thick piece of spongy material around the animal's stomach.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
When you cook it, it looks very funny.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So this is actually a famous Italian dish as well, right?

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I think so, I think they eat it in the South more, but you can definitely get tripe in a lot of different places in Italy.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, very good.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So there you have it, a lot of different dishes, Italian dishes, we've taken a look at a couple of pasta dishes, why don't we take a break, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good evening, ladies.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
May I take your order?

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do you have any recommendations?

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, I personally like the chicken penne, with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Of course, ma'am, and for you?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll have the horse tripe.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
All right, we're back, so now we're going to give you three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Fluency Builder.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So the phrases we have selected for you today are phrases that you are sure to hear anytime you go to a restaurant in America or any other English speaking country.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But basically, you have a waiter who comes to you if you sit down, and this is what they'll say.

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The first thing they'll say is, I'll be your server.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll be your server tonight.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So he introduces himself, he says, good evening, ladies, my name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So when he's saying, I'll be your server, it's another way of saying, I'll be your waiter.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Your waiter, that's right, but server can be a man or a woman, and a waiter can only be a man.

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If it's a woman, it's a waitress.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so waitress for a woman, waiter for a guy, but if you use server, it's for men and women.

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, I'll be your server.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And I'd just like to remind you that this is more common in America because in America, waiters and waitresses, or servers, they have to earn tips, and so they're very nice.

88
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, so this is why they introduce themselves, they are very nice to you, and then they ask, may I take your order?

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
May I take your order?

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So the verb to take here doesn't mean to take it from you, it means to ask you, and then they'll write it down.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, so the server will ask you what you want to order, and then we'll write it down.

92
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And the order is what you have decided to eat, so that's the food that you order.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now this next phrase is very, very handy, especially if you're in a country that maybe you don't know the dishes well, or if you're in a restaurant that you want to see what they recommend, you can just say.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Do you have any recommendations?

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you have any recommendations?

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay so this is a way to ask the server what's good.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So what he thinks is good, or what the restaurant serves very well.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay so you could say, I've never been to this restaurant before, do you have any recommendations?

99
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Or maybe even, Marco, we're having dinner, and I know that you really like Italian food, and I don't know much about Italian food, so I can ask you, do you have any recommendations?

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay, so this is a way of asking what is good here, what is delicious in this restaurant?

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What's good to eat?

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, alright, so three phrases there for you, why don't we take another short break, and let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Good evening, ladies.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
My name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
May I take your order?

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Do you have any recommendations?

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, I personally like the chicken penne, with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Mmm, I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course, ma'am.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And for you?

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I, uh, I'll have the horse tripe.

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Alright, so talking about pasta, now, one thing, before you mentioned all these different types of pasta, they're basically the same thing, they're just different shapes, right?

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's how you distinguish them.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well, yeah, they're basically made from the same ingredients, and so you have, most of them are kind of a yellow color, but sometimes you have pastas that are a dark, like a brown or a green, that depends on what kind of things you put into the dough.

115
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Right.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But generally, they're the same ingredients, but they are different shapes, like they have curly ones, and they have long ones and short ones.

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Alright, so how do you pronounce, we said penne in English, in American English, but in proper Italian it would be?

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Penne.

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Penne.

120
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So you double pronounce the consonant.

121
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

122
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What about fettuccine?

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Fettuccine.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, it's fettuccine.

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Fettuccine.

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
In American we say fettuccini.

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Fettuccine, yeah.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like fettuccine alfredo is a very common American Italian dish, but in Italian it would be fettuccine, so you might hear it differently.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And what about spaghetti?

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Spaghetti.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Spaghetti, oh, you pronounce the double T as well.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's right.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, so you said that obviously there are a lot of other types of pasta.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What about this pasta that's, I think it's made of spinach, it's green.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, that's just a spinach pasta, basically, and so they put the spinach in the dough.

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you can also find very many shapes, like the angel hair pasta is very popular.

137
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's very thin, that's the one I was saying, it's almost like hair, it's so thin, it's long as well.

138
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What about those little curly tubes?

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They look like penne, but they're kind of curved, they look like little ends or U's.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, you have macaroni.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Macaroni.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They're called elbow macaroni, we call them in America, and they look like your elbow on your arms, we call them elbow macaroni.

143
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What about the ones that have like a spiral, they kind of look like springs.

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Those are called fusilli.

145
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Fusilli, uh-huh.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, and you also have one that's very special, this is my favorite pasta by the way, it's called orecchiette, and they look like your ear, and that's what that means in Italian, it means your little ear.

147
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh really?

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yeah, so ear pastas.

149
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Wow, and what about ravioli, this is probably one of the most famous dishes, ravioli, what is this?

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A ravioli is like a square, it's like a square pasta, but it's more like a pocket or a pillow, and inside you have ingredients, like meat or cheese usually is very popular.

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So you have this cheese inside this little packet, this little dough, it's very soft and very warm, and then on top sometimes people like to put butter or tomato sauce, it's really delicious.

152
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So that's the main difference, this was obviously, all the pastas that we mentioned, they're just uh, they don't have anything inside them.
