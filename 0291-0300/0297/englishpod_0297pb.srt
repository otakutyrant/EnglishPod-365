00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,839
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:09,740
My name is Catherine, and we have a delicious Italian food lesson for you today.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,480
That's right.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,859
We are at an Italian restaurant, and we are ordering food.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,300
So this is going to be very helpful next time you are at an Italian restaurant with your friends and you're ordering up some dishes.

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,979
Good evening, ladies.

9
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,640
My name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

10
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,380
May I take your order?

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,859
Do you have any recommendations?

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,920
Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,479
Mmm, I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,679
Of course, ma'am.

15
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,460
And for you?

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,280
I, uh, I'll have the horse tripe.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,019
All right, we're back, and now let's take a look at all those delicious Italian dishes on Language Takeaway.

18
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,019
Language Takeaway.

19
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,480
So first of all, we have two different kinds of sauce, really.

20
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,859
The first is cream mushroom.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,239
So what's a cream sauce, Marco?

22
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,700
A cream mushroom sauce.

23
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:44,340
So basically, this is cream from, like, milk, and you have mushrooms in it, and it's, I don't know, I think everyone has seen it.

24
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:46,359
It's a very thick white sauce.

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,659
It has little slices of mushrooms in it.

26
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:49,780
And it's kind of sweet.

27
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:55,980
That's right, and so oftentimes you see there's cream sauces, which are white, and tomato sauces, which are red.

28
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,799
And this here is a cream sauce, so it's white, and it's got chunks of mushroom in it, very tasty.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,879
And the waiter also offered prawn with the pasta.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
So what is a prawn?

31
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,199
Prawn fettuccine.

32
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,960
So prawn is like a big, it's like a word for shrimp.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,340
I always think of jumbo prawns, which are these big, big, big shrimps.

34
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,159
So they're basically the same thing.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,300
Shrimp and prawn are basically the same.

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,659
That's right, and they're a seafood that when they get cooked, they curl, and so they look like a circle, but they're pinkish or red.

37
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,319
That's right.

38
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,500
They're very tasty.

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,300
Okay, so now let's take a look at the different types of pasta.

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,780
So we have three different types of pasta that the waiter suggested, so the first one is...

41
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:48,919
Okay, we're gonna say all three in the American way, but I'm gonna tell you, the Italian way is quite different, so I'll say that afterwards.

42
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:50,039
The first is penne.

43
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,039
Okay, so this is a type of pasta.

44
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,860
What does it look like?

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:04,539
It is like a small tube, so maybe three centimeters long, and it is round, and it has a hole in the middle, and so it's a kind of pasta.

46
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,580
And what about the fettuccine?

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,680
So fettuccine is a long noodle, but it's flat.

48
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,419
It's not round, it's flat, fettuccine.

49
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,360
So it kinda looks like a shoelace.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah, it's long and flat.

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,460
Okay, and then we have spaghetti, which I think many people know, and this is probably the most popular one.

52
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,460
That's right, spaghetti is very long, just like fettuccine, but it's very, very thin and round.

53
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:32,219
So it kinda looks like maybe a pencil, a very long pencil.

54
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,159
But very thin, more like hair, actually.

55
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:34,699
Melted hair, okay.

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah, and there are thin kinds, so they have a special name, but this is just a normal pasta that you will see everywhere, it's very long, and you can twirl it, you can spin it around your fork.

57
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:46,680
Around your fork.

58
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:51,479
Okay, so that's what we have, we have penne, fettuccine, and spaghetti.

59
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:58,840
Now, the other woman ended up ordering horse tripe, now this is also another Italian dish, what is this exactly?

60
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,840
Well, horse is the animal, so this is tripe that comes from a horse, but tripe is a certain part of the animal that we, it's a food name, actually.

61
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:28,980
So when we eat the stomach lining, the part of the stomach that goes around the stomach, it's kind of squishy, soft, that is called tripe, and you can have tripe from many different animals, like cows or pigs, but in this case it's horse tripe, so it's basically that thick piece of spongy material around the animal's stomach.

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,519
When you cook it, it looks very funny.

63
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,519
So this is actually a famous Italian dish as well, right?

64
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,819
I think so, I think they eat it in the South more, but you can definitely get tripe in a lot of different places in Italy.

65
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:42,879
Okay, very good.

66
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:53,500
So there you have it, a lot of different dishes, Italian dishes, we've taken a look at a couple of pasta dishes, why don't we take a break, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

67
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,420
Good evening, ladies.

68
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,120
My name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

69
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,819
May I take your order?

70
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,319
Do you have any recommendations?

71
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:21,399
Well, I personally like the chicken penne, with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

72
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,959
No, I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

73
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,920
Of course, ma'am, and for you?

74
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,080
I'll have the horse tripe.

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,600
All right, we're back, so now we're going to give you three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,199
Fluency Builder.

77
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:58,819
So the phrases we have selected for you today are phrases that you are sure to hear anytime you go to a restaurant in America or any other English speaking country.

78
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,680
But basically, you have a waiter who comes to you if you sit down, and this is what they'll say.

79
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,199
The first thing they'll say is, I'll be your server.

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,740
I'll be your server tonight.

81
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:13,379
So he introduces himself, he says, good evening, ladies, my name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

82
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,579
So when he's saying, I'll be your server, it's another way of saying, I'll be your waiter.

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,339
Your waiter, that's right, but server can be a man or a woman, and a waiter can only be a man.

84
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:25,800
If it's a woman, it's a waitress.

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,300
Okay, so waitress for a woman, waiter for a guy, but if you use server, it's for men and women.

86
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,519
Yes, I'll be your server.

87
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:44,120
And I'd just like to remind you that this is more common in America because in America, waiters and waitresses, or servers, they have to earn tips, and so they're very nice.

88
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,759
Okay, so this is why they introduce themselves, they are very nice to you, and then they ask, may I take your order?

89
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:54,600
May I take your order?

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:02,519
So the verb to take here doesn't mean to take it from you, it means to ask you, and then they'll write it down.

91
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,699
Okay, so the server will ask you what you want to order, and then we'll write it down.

92
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,000
And the order is what you have decided to eat, so that's the food that you order.

93
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:23,639
Now this next phrase is very, very handy, especially if you're in a country that maybe you don't know the dishes well, or if you're in a restaurant that you want to see what they recommend, you can just say.

94
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,959
Do you have any recommendations?

95
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,699
Do you have any recommendations?

96
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,279
Okay so this is a way to ask the server what's good.

97
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:36,620
So what he thinks is good, or what the restaurant serves very well.

98
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,360
Okay so you could say, I've never been to this restaurant before, do you have any recommendations?

99
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:51,899
Or maybe even, Marco, we're having dinner, and I know that you really like Italian food, and I don't know much about Italian food, so I can ask you, do you have any recommendations?

100
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:58,759
Okay, so this is a way of asking what is good here, what is delicious in this restaurant?

101
00:07:58,939 --> 00:07:59,600
What's good to eat?

102
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay, alright, so three phrases there for you, why don't we take another short break, and let's listen to the dialogue for the last time.

103
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,259
Good evening, ladies.

104
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,959
My name is Josh, and I'll be your server tonight.

105
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,699
May I take your order?

106
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,199
Do you have any recommendations?

107
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:34,240
Well, I personally like the chicken penne, with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.

108
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,820
Mmm, I'd like to have the grilled chicken, but can I have spaghetti instead of penne?

109
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,940
Of course, ma'am.

110
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,799
And for you?

111
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,700
I, uh, I'll have the horse tripe.

112
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:04,639
Alright, so talking about pasta, now, one thing, before you mentioned all these different types of pasta, they're basically the same thing, they're just different shapes, right?

113
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,899
That's how you distinguish them.

114
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:18,620
Well, yeah, they're basically made from the same ingredients, and so you have, most of them are kind of a yellow color, but sometimes you have pastas that are a dark, like a brown or a green, that depends on what kind of things you put into the dough.

115
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:19,080
Right.

116
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:26,000
But generally, they're the same ingredients, but they are different shapes, like they have curly ones, and they have long ones and short ones.

117
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,940
Alright, so how do you pronounce, we said penne in English, in American English, but in proper Italian it would be?

118
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:33,740
Penne.

119
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:34,399
Penne.

120
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,820
So you double pronounce the consonant.

121
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,120
Yes.

122
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
What about fettuccine?

123
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:39,820
Fettuccine.

124
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,679
Oh, it's fettuccine.

125
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,899
Fettuccine.

126
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,100
In American we say fettuccini.

127
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,039
Fettuccine, yeah.

128
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,500
Like fettuccine alfredo is a very common American Italian dish, but in Italian it would be fettuccine, so you might hear it differently.

129
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,639
And what about spaghetti?

130
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,679
Spaghetti.

131
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,360
Spaghetti, oh, you pronounce the double T as well.

132
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,799
That's right.

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,139
Okay, so you said that obviously there are a lot of other types of pasta.

134
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,860
What about this pasta that's, I think it's made of spinach, it's green.

135
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:13,740
Yeah, that's just a spinach pasta, basically, and so they put the spinach in the dough.

136
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:20,200
But you can also find very many shapes, like the angel hair pasta is very popular.

137
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,580
It's very thin, that's the one I was saying, it's almost like hair, it's so thin, it's long as well.

138
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,399
What about those little curly tubes?

139
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:34,100
They look like penne, but they're kind of curved, they look like little ends or U's.

140
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,840
Oh, you have macaroni.

141
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:36,500
Macaroni.

142
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,559
They're called elbow macaroni, we call them in America, and they look like your elbow on your arms, we call them elbow macaroni.

143
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:45,200
What about the ones that have like a spiral, they kind of look like springs.

144
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,580
Those are called fusilli.

145
00:10:47,219 --> 00:10:48,139
Fusilli, uh-huh.

146
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:57,820
Yeah, and you also have one that's very special, this is my favorite pasta by the way, it's called orecchiette, and they look like your ear, and that's what that means in Italian, it means your little ear.

147
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:58,559
Oh really?

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Yeah, so ear pastas.

149
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,340
Wow, and what about ravioli, this is probably one of the most famous dishes, ravioli, what is this?

150
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:17,799
A ravioli is like a square, it's like a square pasta, but it's more like a pocket or a pillow, and inside you have ingredients, like meat or cheese usually is very popular.

151
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:30,700
So you have this cheese inside this little packet, this little dough, it's very soft and very warm, and then on top sometimes people like to put butter or tomato sauce, it's really delicious.

152
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:37,220
So that's the main difference, this was obviously, all the pastas that we mentioned, they're just uh, they don't have anything inside them.
