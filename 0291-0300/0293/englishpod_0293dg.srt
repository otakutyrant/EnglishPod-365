Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Lori and I want to welcome you to this course.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet, cheese.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's get started.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Cheese is usually categorized into four types, soft, semi-soft, semi-hard and hard.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese which directly affects its texture.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Making cheese is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years and the home cheesemaker can usually find recipes for cheese that fall into any of the four categories.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, blue, roquefort, mozzarella, minster and similar cheeses.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats and can be used as breakfast cheeses in omelet or as pasta fillings.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
American, Colby, Kojak and similar cheeses are in the semi-soft category.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Kojak cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack is one of the most popular.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This allows the sharper flavor of the Colby to be combined with the milder Jack cheese and also melts better than plain Colby.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the greatest powder used to top spaghetti but they are also used as a companion mince for fruit, wine, nuts and other appetizer items.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well unlike some other hard cheeses.
