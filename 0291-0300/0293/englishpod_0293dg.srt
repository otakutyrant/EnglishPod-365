Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,080
My name is Lori and I want to welcome you to this course.

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:16,160
We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet, cheese.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,620
Let's get started.

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:24,239
Cheese is usually categorized into four types, soft, semi-soft, semi-hard and hard.

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,339
The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese which directly affects its texture.

7
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:41,960
Making cheese is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years and the home cheesemaker can usually find recipes for cheese that fall into any of the four categories.

8
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:52,259
Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, blue, roquefort, mozzarella, minster and similar cheeses.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,240
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats and can be used as breakfast cheeses in omelet or as pasta fillings.

10
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,340
They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,079
American, Colby, Kojak and similar cheeses are in the semi-soft category.

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,579
These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses.

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,200
Kojak cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack is one of the most popular.

14
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,859
This allows the sharper flavor of the Colby to be combined with the milder Jack cheese and also melts better than plain Colby.

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:37,840
Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,439
Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others.

17
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:55,680
Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the greatest powder used to top spaghetti but they are also used as a companion mince for fruit, wine, nuts and other appetizer items.

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,739
Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well unlike some other hard cheeses.
