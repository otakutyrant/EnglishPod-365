00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an advanced level lesson for you guys all about food.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What kind of food are we talking about today, Marco?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we're talking about cheese.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So there's so many different types of cheese, so many varieties.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we're going to take a look at these varieties.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You may know them or not, but we're also going to take a look at the pronunciation because most of them are either Italian or French.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So how do you pronounce these in maybe American English?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good question.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the wonderful world of cheese.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello, everyone.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Lori, and I want to welcome you to this course.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet, cheese.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's get started.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Cheese is usually categorized into four types, soft, semi-soft, semi-hard, and hard.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese which directly affects its texture.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Making cheese is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years, and the home cheesemaker can usually find recipes for cheese that fall into any of the four categories.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, blue, roquefort, mozzarella, muenster, and similar cheeses.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats and can be used as breakfast cheeses in an omelet or as pasta fillings.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
American, Colby, Kojak, and similar cheeses are in the semi-soft category.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kojak cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack, is one of the most popular.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This allows the sharper flavor of the Colby to be combined with the milder Jack cheese and also melts better than plain Colby.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere, and others.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they are also used as a companion mince for fruit, wine, nuts, and other appetizer items.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So obviously this is a very interesting lesson because it also gives us an insight into how cheeses are categorized.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I personally did not know that you had all these categories of cheeses, starting out with the soft cheeses.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's right.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So basically they're broken into these soft, semi-soft, semi-hard, and hard categories.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The soft cheeses are the ones that are actually, you know, you could touch them and they're soft, they kind of move under your finger.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And the famous ones I think are cottage cheese, which is almost like yogurt.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, and cream cheese is all.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And cream cheese as well.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But also ricotta, and brie, and roquefort, and mozzarella.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So for example, these cheeses, they're usually as you, well they're obviously very soft cheeses.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you say cheeses or cheese?

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Or cheese eye?

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, we just say cheese normally or different kinds of cheese.

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So in that case you make the plural kinds of cheese.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Types of cheese.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So these kinds of cheese, they are recommended or they say that they pair well with fruits or meats.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So when we talk about pairing a cheese with fruits or pairing a cheese with wine, what are we saying there?

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In that case we're saying that it's best to eat with certain kinds of food.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So you can say, I would recommend pairing this red wine with lamb.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But in the case of cheese, you could say, I would recommend pairing this delicious brie cheese with fruit.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, so you actually have brie with fruit.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, it depends on the kind of cheese.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A lot of times you see mozzarella on pizzas and so it's not paired, it's actually a part of the dish.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
But if you're going to eat a piece of cheese alone, you can have it maybe with some fruit.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So I guess that's the main difference between pairing and having it as an ingredient, is you're pairing, you're combining it, but it's not really part of the dish.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, and as an ingredient, it's actually, it has to be in the dish to make it work.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And so you have a lot of these delicious soft cheeses that you eat at breakfast or sometimes dessert, ricotta, cream cheese, these are all parts of desserts like cheesecake, for example.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh yeah, what do they use in cheesecake?

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Usually cream cheese.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh really?

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But then you get into these other cheeses which are semi-soft or semi-hard.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And semi here just means part.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So it's partially hard, partially soft.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And these cheeses are different because you might use them sliced on sandwiches, things like that.

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In this category you have American and Colby and Monterey Jack is also very, very popular.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So these actually do have a more American sound to it, obviously American cheese or Monterey Jack.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That sounds a little bit different than all the Italian or French sounding cheeses that we had in the soft ones.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right, and you'd even have something like cheddar in this category.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There's another...

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Cheddar cheese.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, there's another good cheese.

73
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
As you said, these are very typically put in sandwiches.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, I mean you can use them in different ways.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sometimes we grate cheese, that means we rub it against this machine, a grater, to make it come out in these little fine pieces.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
For example on top of pasta or on top of nachos.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we have grated cheese, but you can also have sliced cheese, and that's the way that we cut cheese to put it on a sandwich.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So for example if you go to McDonald's and you get a burger, usually the cheese that's on your hamburger is cheddar cheese, right?

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right, it's a slice of cheddar cheese.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, now moving on to our next category, well actually towards the end of the different types of cheese under the semi-soft category, they also talk about Mexican cheeses such as asadero and queso fresco.

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I love queso fresco.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You've had this before?

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, many times.

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What do you usually have it with, or how do you pair it?

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Usually it's an ingredient on tacos, because it's a little bit crumbly.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That means that it's like balls as opposed to being one chunk, one big piece.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And so we usually have it like that, or I've also had it as just a piece of cheese paired with a fried plantain or sour cream.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's actually very good.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The thing with queso fresco is all of the cheese, they also depend on how mature they are, how long they've taken to make them.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And queso fresco, fresco means fresh in Spanish, and this is the main factor in this type of cheese is that it's very, very immature.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's a very fresh cheese.

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can make it in like a day or two.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Exactly, it just takes one night to sit and to become cheese, basically.

94
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But other cheeses, and we'll see some of these in the hard cheeses, take a very long time to become their final cheese state.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And one of those cheeses is parmesan.

96
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In Italy, when you buy parmesan, they have these big wheels of it, they're circles, and you have to pay according to how old it is.

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
18 months, 36 months, and it gets more expensive the older it is.

98
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So obviously the older it is, just like wine, it has a more intense flavor.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right, and there are special characteristics for certain ages.

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sometimes people really like the young ones.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It depends on your taste and what you're going to use it for.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But romano is another cheese in Italy that's used, like parmesan, on top of pastas.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So spaghetti, you would grate it, and you would put it on top of pasta.

104
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, okay.

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What about, they also mentioned this other one, asiago.

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Asiago cheese, Swiss cheese is the one with the holes.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Asiago is, I don't know, maybe it's Spanish.

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But then we have gruyere, which is a French cheese, and it tends to be very, very, very strong flavored.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So I think gruyere is the cheese that usually many people use for making fondue.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So they basically have this big pot, or this medium-sized pot, and all the cheese just melts, and you just dip pieces of bread or vegetables in there, and you eat this just melted cheese.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mmm, fondue.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Very popular dish in Switzerland.

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's right.

114
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But yeah, all these different types of cheese, as you said, there's so many different types, and according to the age.

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, you lived in Italy for a while, and obviously they are a very, they're a nation that enjoy having wine and cheese very regularly, right?

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's right, and I have to say that people in Parma take their cheese very, very seriously.

117
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How serious?

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, every, well, a lot of people buy these big pieces of parmesan cheese, and they keep them in the refrigerator.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And you don't just put the parmesan cheese on the spaghetti.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You also break pieces of it, and you eat it alone with some, you know, a glass of wine.

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Or some people like to put a little drop of balsamic vinegar on top of the cheese to give it some flavor.

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, really?

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So there are many different ways to eat it.

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sure it's different all over the country, but mozzarella, parmesan cheese, Romano, these are all cheeses that are very, very important in Italian culture.

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's very interesting because, well, obviously we have listeners from all over the world, but some countries have a good culture for wine, cheese, and cured meats.

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like, for example, in South America, if you visit Argentina or Chile, they are a nation that actually have a lot of variety of cheese, wines, and cured meats.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But if you take a trip to maybe Colombia, they're not really that type of culture.

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
They really consume cheese and wine in the same manner.

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Interesting.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I wonder if it has to do with the historical relationship between Europe and the place like Argentina.

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In Argentina, there's lots of Italian former people who came over from Italy many, many years ago, right?

132
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So that might have something to do with it.

133
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Spain has a very strong tradition of cured meats and cheeses.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
They have Manchego cheese, things like this.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So I wonder if there's a relationship there.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think it's definitely an influence in some way.

137
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But the thing with cheese, I think in many places it's very expensive.

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It can be.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Comparatively to, you know, if you can have a regular mozzarella cheese, but sometimes these other types, they can be very expensive.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah, it's like good wine.

141
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If you really want to pay for good cheese, it's going to cost you a lot of money.

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Now, what about this, the famous blue cheese?

143
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We didn't mention it, but this is a very famous French cheese that basically has mold on it.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, yeah, all cheese, you're growing cultures.

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're growing these things that are alive but blue cheese, you can actually see it and it's moldy.

146
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's white and there's some blue or green mold.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And some people love it and some people hate it.

148
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think it depends on your tastes, but it does have a very strong flavor.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you personally like it or dislike it?

150
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I do not like blue cheese, but I love other kinds of cheeses like Camembert, which is a French cheese with a very strong flavor, very stinky cheese.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So it's not necessarily that it's strong, it's just that I don't like the taste very much.

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Actually, it's very popular to put on salads, right?

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Blue cheese sauce or a dressing.

155
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Blue cheese dressing, yeah, that's right.

156
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's made out of blue cheese.

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a very interesting topic and I'm sure that locally many people also make or countries have their own types of cheese.

158
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I know, for example, in Ecuador, we do have also something very similar to queso fresco that's commonly used for breakfast.

159
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And here's an interesting thing.

160
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They put it in their cup of coffee.

161
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No way.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's cheese cheese, isn't it?

163
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's cheese.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So basically, you have coffee with milk, very popular in Latin America.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And people will take a piece of cheese and put it in their coffee.

166
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So obviously, with the heat, it won't melt completely, but it will become very bendy and very soft.

167
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And so it gives it a very interesting taste.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It may sound a little bit peculiar, but it actually has a very, very interesting taste, very good taste.

169
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I've had many friends try and they're like, wow, you wouldn't really think that you would probably dip cheese in coffee, but it works.

170
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
No, it's a very unusual combination.

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Now, what is this special cheese called?

172
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's called queso le mesa, which is basically a normal, common, everyday table cheese.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So it's not any particular.

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's very similar to queso fresco, very immature cheese.

175
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
So I'm very curious to know if in your country you also have a strong cheese culture.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And if in your country you guys do have a lot of cheese, what kind of cheese is it?

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I know that every country has its own variety of cheeses, and some places like China aren't really into cheese.

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So you can let us know if your country doesn't really have that many cheese options.

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So we're very curious to hear about you and your taste in cheese.

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let us know.

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We hope to see you there.

183
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
All right, guys.

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
See you later.

185
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,000
