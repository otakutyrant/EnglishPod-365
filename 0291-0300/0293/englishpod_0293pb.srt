00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,339
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,059
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,460
My name is Catherine, and today we have an advanced level lesson for you guys all about food.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,259
What kind of food are we talking about today, Marco?

5
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:13,140
Today we're talking about cheese.

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
So there's so many different types of cheese, so many varieties.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,359
So we're going to take a look at these varieties.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,679
You may know them or not, but we're also going to take a look at the pronunciation because most of them are either Italian or French.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,940
So how do you pronounce these in maybe American English?

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,940
Good question.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,539
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about the wonderful world of cheese.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,359
Hello, everyone.

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,539
My name is Lori, and I want to welcome you to this course.

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,700
We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet, cheese.

15
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,100
Let's get started.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,740
Cheese is usually categorized into four types, soft, semi-soft, semi-hard, and hard.

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,840
The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese which directly affects its texture.

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:17,420
Making cheese is an ancient practice dating back thousands of years, and the home cheesemaker can usually find recipes for cheese that fall into any of the four categories.

19
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:27,840
Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, blue, roquefort, mozzarella, muenster, and similar cheeses.

20
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:36,760
These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats and can be used as breakfast cheeses in an omelet or as pasta fillings.

21
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,859
They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.

22
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,579
American, Colby, Kojak, and similar cheeses are in the semi-soft category.

23
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,180
These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses.

24
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:56,680
Kojak cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterey Jack, is one of the most popular.

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,319
This allows the sharper flavor of the Colby to be combined with the milder Jack cheese and also melts better than plain Colby.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,319
Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,939
Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere, and others.

28
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:31,139
Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they are also used as a companion mince for fruit, wine, nuts, and other appetizer items.

29
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,240
Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.

30
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:40,879
All right, we're back.

31
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:48,599
So obviously this is a very interesting lesson because it also gives us an insight into how cheeses are categorized.

32
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,699
I personally did not know that you had all these categories of cheeses, starting out with the soft cheeses.

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,599
That's right.

34
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,219
So basically they're broken into these soft, semi-soft, semi-hard, and hard categories.

35
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:08,159
The soft cheeses are the ones that are actually, you know, you could touch them and they're soft, they kind of move under your finger.

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,840
And the famous ones I think are cottage cheese, which is almost like yogurt.

37
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,659
Yeah, and cream cheese is all.

38
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,879
And cream cheese as well.

39
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,219
But also ricotta, and brie, and roquefort, and mozzarella.

40
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,919
So for example, these cheeses, they're usually as you, well they're obviously very soft cheeses.

41
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,599
Do you say cheeses or cheese?

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,759
Or cheese eye?

43
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,120
Yeah, we just say cheese normally or different kinds of cheese.

44
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,580
So in that case you make the plural kinds of cheese.

45
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,199
Types of cheese.

46
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,360
So these kinds of cheese, they are recommended or they say that they pair well with fruits or meats.

47
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,819
So when we talk about pairing a cheese with fruits or pairing a cheese with wine, what are we saying there?

48
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,180
In that case we're saying that it's best to eat with certain kinds of food.

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,400
So you can say, I would recommend pairing this red wine with lamb.

50
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,500
But in the case of cheese, you could say, I would recommend pairing this delicious brie cheese with fruit.

51
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,599
Okay, so you actually have brie with fruit.

52
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:15,699
That's right.

53
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,939
Well, it depends on the kind of cheese.

54
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,459
A lot of times you see mozzarella on pizzas and so it's not paired, it's actually a part of the dish.

55
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,879
But if you're going to eat a piece of cheese alone, you can have it maybe with some fruit.

56
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:36,279
So I guess that's the main difference between pairing and having it as an ingredient, is you're pairing, you're combining it, but it's not really part of the dish.

57
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,439
No, and as an ingredient, it's actually, it has to be in the dish to make it work.

58
00:04:42,579 --> 00:04:53,300
And so you have a lot of these delicious soft cheeses that you eat at breakfast or sometimes dessert, ricotta, cream cheese, these are all parts of desserts like cheesecake, for example.

59
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,680
Oh yeah, what do they use in cheesecake?

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,740
Usually cream cheese.

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,139
Oh really?

62
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:03,060
But then you get into these other cheeses which are semi-soft or semi-hard.

63
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:04,639
And semi here just means part.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,379
So it's partially hard, partially soft.

65
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:13,699
And these cheeses are different because you might use them sliced on sandwiches, things like that.

66
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,939
In this category you have American and Colby and Monterey Jack is also very, very popular.

67
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:28,300
So these actually do have a more American sound to it, obviously American cheese or Monterey Jack.

68
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,639
That sounds a little bit different than all the Italian or French sounding cheeses that we had in the soft ones.

69
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,779
That's right, and you'd even have something like cheddar in this category.

70
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,819
There's another...

71
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:38,439
Cheddar cheese.

72
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,639
Yeah, there's another good cheese.

73
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,399
As you said, these are very typically put in sandwiches.

74
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,259
Yeah, I mean you can use them in different ways.

75
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:55,339
Sometimes we grate cheese, that means we rub it against this machine, a grater, to make it come out in these little fine pieces.

76
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:01,060
For example on top of pasta or on top of nachos.

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,459
So we have grated cheese, but you can also have sliced cheese, and that's the way that we cut cheese to put it on a sandwich.

78
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:15,500
So for example if you go to McDonald's and you get a burger, usually the cheese that's on your hamburger is cheddar cheese, right?

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,379
That's right, it's a slice of cheddar cheese.

80
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:30,579
Okay, now moving on to our next category, well actually towards the end of the different types of cheese under the semi-soft category, they also talk about Mexican cheeses such as asadero and queso fresco.

81
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,259
I love queso fresco.

82
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,240
You've had this before?

83
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,660
Yes, many times.

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,319
What do you usually have it with, or how do you pair it?

85
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,279
Usually it's an ingredient on tacos, because it's a little bit crumbly.

86
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,339
That means that it's like balls as opposed to being one chunk, one big piece.

87
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:57,839
And so we usually have it like that, or I've also had it as just a piece of cheese paired with a fried plantain or sour cream.

88
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:00,060
It's actually very good.

89
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:09,560
The thing with queso fresco is all of the cheese, they also depend on how mature they are, how long they've taken to make them.

90
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:19,259
And queso fresco, fresco means fresh in Spanish, and this is the main factor in this type of cheese is that it's very, very immature.

91
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,579
It's a very fresh cheese.

92
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,100
You can make it in like a day or two.

93
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,939
Exactly, it just takes one night to sit and to become cheese, basically.

94
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:35,079
But other cheeses, and we'll see some of these in the hard cheeses, take a very long time to become their final cheese state.

95
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,240
And one of those cheeses is parmesan.

96
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,579
In Italy, when you buy parmesan, they have these big wheels of it, they're circles, and you have to pay according to how old it is.

97
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,439
18 months, 36 months, and it gets more expensive the older it is.

98
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,279
So obviously the older it is, just like wine, it has a more intense flavor.

99
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,779
That's right, and there are special characteristics for certain ages.

100
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,639
Sometimes people really like the young ones.

101
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,759
It depends on your taste and what you're going to use it for.

102
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,259
But romano is another cheese in Italy that's used, like parmesan, on top of pastas.

103
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,399
So spaghetti, you would grate it, and you would put it on top of pasta.

104
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:13,879
Oh, okay.

105
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,839
What about, they also mentioned this other one, asiago.

106
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,519
Asiago cheese, Swiss cheese is the one with the holes.

107
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,699
Asiago is, I don't know, maybe it's Spanish.

108
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,699
But then we have gruyere, which is a French cheese, and it tends to be very, very, very strong flavored.

109
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:37,759
So I think gruyere is the cheese that usually many people use for making fondue.

110
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:48,820
So they basically have this big pot, or this medium-sized pot, and all the cheese just melts, and you just dip pieces of bread or vegetables in there, and you eat this just melted cheese.

111
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,659
Mmm, fondue.

112
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,360
Very popular dish in Switzerland.

113
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:52,360
That's right.

114
00:08:53,379 --> 00:09:01,320
But yeah, all these different types of cheese, as you said, there's so many different types, and according to the age.

115
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:10,299
Now, you lived in Italy for a while, and obviously they are a very, they're a nation that enjoy having wine and cheese very regularly, right?

116
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:16,200
That's right, and I have to say that people in Parma take their cheese very, very seriously.

117
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:16,820
How serious?

118
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, every, well, a lot of people buy these big pieces of parmesan cheese, and they keep them in the refrigerator.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,799
And you don't just put the parmesan cheese on the spaghetti.

120
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,919
You also break pieces of it, and you eat it alone with some, you know, a glass of wine.

121
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:39,179
Or some people like to put a little drop of balsamic vinegar on top of the cheese to give it some flavor.

122
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:39,639
Oh, really?

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
So there are many different ways to eat it.

124
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,460
I'm sure it's different all over the country, but mozzarella, parmesan cheese, Romano, these are all cheeses that are very, very important in Italian culture.

125
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:59,500
It's very interesting because, well, obviously we have listeners from all over the world, but some countries have a good culture for wine, cheese, and cured meats.

126
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:09,220
Like, for example, in South America, if you visit Argentina or Chile, they are a nation that actually have a lot of variety of cheese, wines, and cured meats.

127
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,679
But if you take a trip to maybe Colombia, they're not really that type of culture.

128
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,860
They really consume cheese and wine in the same manner.

129
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,360
Interesting.

130
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,179
I wonder if it has to do with the historical relationship between Europe and the place like Argentina.

131
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,500
In Argentina, there's lots of Italian former people who came over from Italy many, many years ago, right?

132
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,100
So that might have something to do with it.

133
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,159
Spain has a very strong tradition of cured meats and cheeses.

134
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,539
They have Manchego cheese, things like this.

135
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,500
So I wonder if there's a relationship there.

136
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,779
I think it's definitely an influence in some way.

137
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:48,700
But the thing with cheese, I think in many places it's very expensive.

138
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:49,799
It can be.

139
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:56,659
Comparatively to, you know, if you can have a regular mozzarella cheese, but sometimes these other types, they can be very expensive.

140
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:57,960
Yeah, it's like good wine.

141
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,120
If you really want to pay for good cheese, it's going to cost you a lot of money.

142
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,240
Now, what about this, the famous blue cheese?

143
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:10,879
We didn't mention it, but this is a very famous French cheese that basically has mold on it.

144
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,039
Well, yeah, all cheese, you're growing cultures.

145
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:20,559
You're growing these things that are alive but blue cheese, you can actually see it and it's moldy.

146
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,539
It's white and there's some blue or green mold.

147
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,539
And some people love it and some people hate it.

148
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:31,320
I think it depends on your tastes, but it does have a very strong flavor.

149
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,399
Do you personally like it or dislike it?

150
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:42,799
I do not like blue cheese, but I love other kinds of cheeses like Camembert, which is a French cheese with a very strong flavor, very stinky cheese.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,960
So it's not necessarily that it's strong, it's just that I don't like the taste very much.

152
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:48,340
Okay.

153
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,700
Actually, it's very popular to put on salads, right?

154
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,500
Blue cheese sauce or a dressing.

155
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,039
Blue cheese dressing, yeah, that's right.

156
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,039
It's made out of blue cheese.

157
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:05,620
It's a very interesting topic and I'm sure that locally many people also make or countries have their own types of cheese.

158
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:12,659
I know, for example, in Ecuador, we do have also something very similar to queso fresco that's commonly used for breakfast.

159
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,480
And here's an interesting thing.

160
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:17,279
They put it in their cup of coffee.

161
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,139
No way.

162
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,220
It's cheese cheese, isn't it?

163
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,879
It's cheese.

164
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:27,200
So basically, you have coffee with milk, very popular in Latin America.

165
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,779
And people will take a piece of cheese and put it in their coffee.

166
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:36,980
So obviously, with the heat, it won't melt completely, but it will become very bendy and very soft.

167
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,019
And so it gives it a very interesting taste.

168
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:50,259
It may sound a little bit peculiar, but it actually has a very, very interesting taste, very good taste.

169
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:56,299
I've had many friends try and they're like, wow, you wouldn't really think that you would probably dip cheese in coffee, but it works.

170
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,600
No, it's a very unusual combination.

171
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,279
Now, what is this special cheese called?

172
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:07,059
It's called queso le mesa, which is basically a normal, common, everyday table cheese.

173
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,000
So it's not any particular.

174
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,720
It's very similar to queso fresco, very immature cheese.

175
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,159
So I'm very curious to know if in your country you also have a strong cheese culture.

176
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,159
And if in your country you guys do have a lot of cheese, what kind of cheese is it?

177
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:26,440
I know that every country has its own variety of cheeses, and some places like China aren't really into cheese.

178
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,139
So you can let us know if your country doesn't really have that many cheese options.

179
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,399
So we're very curious to hear about you and your taste in cheese.

180
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,100
Let us know.

181
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:36,860
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,759
We hope to see you there.

183
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,379
All right, guys.

184
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:38,820
See you later.

185
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:39,340
Bye.
