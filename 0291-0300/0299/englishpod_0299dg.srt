EnglishPod.com Hi.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I would like to return this TV.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sure.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Do you have a receipt?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here you go.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie, and at times the image is not very clear.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I see.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And what about the keyboard?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I spilled some coffee on it, and now it won't work.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Fine.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.
