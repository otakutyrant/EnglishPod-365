EnglishPod.com Hi.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,279
I would like to return this TV.

3
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:10,660
Sure.

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,660
Do you have a receipt?

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,339
Yeah.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,259
Here you go.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,140
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,260
Okay.

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,160
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:28,460
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie, and at times the image is not very clear.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,500
I see.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,280
And what about the keyboard?

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,060
I spilled some coffee on it, and now it won't work.

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,820
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,280
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,159
Fine.

17
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,899
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.
