00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine, and we're going shopping today at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we are going to the store because we want to return a product.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So maybe the product that we bought had some problem, and we want our money back.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about what's going on.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hi, I would like to return this TV.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sure.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do you have a receipt?

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here you go.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie, and at times the image is not very clear.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I see.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And what about the keyboard?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I spilled some coffee on it, and now it won't work.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Fine.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
All right.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're back.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So now let's take a look at some of those keywords on language takeaway.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
So we've got a great bunch of words for you here today.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The first three are nouns, and then afterwards we've got a couple of adjectives to describe those nouns.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But first up, we have the word receipt.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So we want to return the television, and the worker there asks us if we have the receipt.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A receipt is a small piece of paper that you receive from a clerk or a server after you buy something.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So if I buy a TV, I will have this small piece of paper that says that I paid $500 for the TV.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So usually they will ask you for the receipt to see when you bought the product and if you bought the product at that store.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So the receipt has all sorts of information, date, time, method of payment, cost, all those things.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it's very important if you ever want to return something.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now, later on in the dialogue, the character explains why he wants to return the TV.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now Marco, why does he want to do that?

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Well, he has a problem with the TV when he's watching a movie.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Basically, the image is not very clear.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So this is the keyword image.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So image can mean a couple of different things.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You might hear the word image to mean a photograph or a picture, like on a computer.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But in this case, the image is how well you can see the images on TV, the things on TV.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's right.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So on TV, it's like you're seeing many, many images all at once or very rapidly together.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So maybe if you can't see clearly, you say that the image is not clear on the TV.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So if it's fuzzy, like there's gray and black, the image is not clear.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can also say that, you know, I really like my new TV.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The image is very clear.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And not only are we returning a TV, but we're also returning a keyboard.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All right.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A keyboard, a key is something that you can push.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But a keyboard is this thing that you use with your computer to type words.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So many of you who are using the website as we speak are using a keyboard and a mouse.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So these are probably one of the two most well-known objects when you're using a computer.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can buy French keyboards and Russian keyboards.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So keyboard is the general word for this tool.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So we are returning the keyboard and the clerk explains that we can only return it if it is defective, if the product is defective.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
All right.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So this is one of those adjectives I talked about a minute ago.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Adjectives describe things.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So my keyboard is defective or this TV is defective.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That means it doesn't work.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So we have a defective product.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not working properly.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It has some problem.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And well, the guy was complaining that he didn't understand why these things like the keyboard are so delicate.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
All right.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Delicate is something you might see written on the side of a box when you receive a package.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Something that is delicate breaks very easily.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So you have to handle with care.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So for example, glass is very delicate.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It can break easily.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All right.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Glass is delicate, but stones, a big rock, that's not delicate.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All right.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So that's all we have for Language Takeaway.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's review everything and listen to our dialogue.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hi.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I would like to return this TV.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Sure.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you have a receipt?

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Here you go.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I see.

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And what about the keyboard?

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Fine.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
All right.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We're back.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we've picked out for To Be Exact on Fluency Builder.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Fluency Builder.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The first verb we have today here in Fluency Builder is the main verb in today's dialogue, to return.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I would like to return this TV.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So when you want to give back a product, you don't say, I want to give back or anything like this.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You say, I want to return this product.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Well, it's not just giving back.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's giving back and getting your money back.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So to return means that you bring back the product and the store will give you back your money.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right.

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And he wanted to return the TV, as we mentioned, because the image was not very clear, but he also mentioned that the TV flickers a lot.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So what is this, to flicker?

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To flicker is another verb and flicker is something that things with light do.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The light flickers, the TV flickers.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It means the light comes on and off, on and off, on and off.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So dark light, dark light.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's not very steady.

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not like there's light or dark.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And so this is very annoying when you're watching TV because it goes light, dark, light, dark, and it's hard to see what's happening.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Exactly.

136
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So it's basically, just imagine someone is turning on and off the light all the time.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's the same thing that's happening with the TV.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It flickers.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Exactly.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or like when a light bulb in your lamp, when a light bulb is dying, it flickers.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
All right.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So we wanted to actually return these goods and the clerk explained that we can exchange or we can refund defective products.

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

145
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
These are two important verbs.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Exchange means to trade one thing for another.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So when I go to a foreign country, I exchange money, right?

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can exchange Japanese yen for American dollars.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But at a store, like an electronics store, I can exchange my TV that I don't like for maybe a really good MP3 player or something like that.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So that's what happens usually if maybe your TV is broken or it had some problem, you exchange it for a new one, right?

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But maybe you don't want the TV anymore.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Maybe you changed your mind.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So you want to get a refund.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So refund, you hear this word fund, it has to do with money.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
A refund means that the store will give you all your money back.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So if I refund my TV, I give my TV to the store, the store gives me $500 or whatever the money for the TV was, and I can buy anything else anywhere else.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's right.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So this is what happens when you get a refund.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Very different from exchanging the goods.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And finally, the clerk explained that they cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So remember this as a phrase.

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is really important to take responsibility.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It means that if something goes wrong, you will take responsibility for it.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You will handle it.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
All right.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So for example, the store says that it can't take responsibility if something is broken.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That means that they won't pay you back money.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So if you buy a TV and you accidentally get it wet or you get water inside and this is why it gets damaged, then the store cannot take responsibility for this damage.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Or you could say the other way around.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You could say, if you're at the office and you make a mistake on a report, you say, listen, boss, I'm really sorry.

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I take full responsibility for this mistake.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can punish me or you can make me do it again, but I take responsibility means that I say it's my fault.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Right.

176
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're guilty.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So that's all we have for Fluency Builder.

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we can review everything we've just learned.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hi.

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I would like to return this TV.

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sure.

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you have a receipt?

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

185
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Here you go.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I see.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And what about the keyboard?

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Fine.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So returning goods is a very useful thing if you maybe bought a TV at a department store or an electronic store, then you would want to return it if you had some problems.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Now, how easy or difficult is it to do?

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Because in theory, in the dialogue, it seems like it's really easy.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It depends on the store, of course.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So some stores make it easier to do this.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Some stores make it harder.

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can tell you in most stores, if you don't have a receipt, it's probably very difficult.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Really?

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But a lot of stores have something else that they sell you or give you when you buy something.

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's called a warranty.

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And this is something that will help protect you if you take the TV home and you have a problem.

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That means that they will come fix it or they will give you a new one without any questions about what happened.

210
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Now, not only can you return goods such as TVs, electronics, or maybe clothes, but in some cases also things that you buy at the supermarket, like maybe chicken.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've heard that maybe sometimes you buy chicken and you open it up that same day and it's gone bad.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Really?

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I've never had that experience, but I think it makes sense.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It depends where you buy it, of course.

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Right.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Obviously at a supermarket and you show the receipt.

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Or maybe milk, maybe that's gone bad sometimes.

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Or yogurt.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Well, because they probably shouldn't sell it if it's bad.

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Exactly.

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So if you tell them that they sold you bad milk, they'll give you a new one.

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Exactly.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So that's called an exchange.

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You would exchange the bad one for the good one.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Right.

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You wouldn't get your money back.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Maybe.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Maybe not.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Maybe.

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
All right.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So that's all the time we have for today, but this is actually a very interesting topic because it has to do a lot with customer service.

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So let us know what your experience is with customer service with returning something.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is it very easy, very difficult?

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Maybe some stores don't even accept returns.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
They say once you buy it, you cannot return it.

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
All sales final.

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, exactly.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So let us know, are refunds or exchanges common where you come from?

239
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And have you ever had a bad experience where you bought something and it didn't work when you got home?

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let us know.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
All right.

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We'll see you guys there.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Bye.
