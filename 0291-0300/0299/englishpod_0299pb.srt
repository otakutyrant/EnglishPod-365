00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,020
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,720
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,780
My name is Catherine, and we're going shopping today at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:08,480
That's right.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:13,140
Today we are going to the store because we want to return a product.

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,679
So maybe the product that we bought had some problem, and we want our money back.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,440
That's right.

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,859
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about what's going on.

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,280
Hi, I would like to return this TV.

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:33,600
Sure.

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:34,619
Do you have a receipt?

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,320
Yeah.

13
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,240
Here you go.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,100
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,219
Okay.

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,119
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:51,439
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie, and at times the image is not very clear.

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,479
I see.

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,259
And what about the keyboard?

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,020
I spilled some coffee on it, and now it won't work.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,780
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

22
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,219
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,159
Fine.

24
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,879
All right.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,239
We're back.

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,620
So now let's take a look at some of those keywords on language takeaway.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,939
Language takeaway.

29
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,260
So we've got a great bunch of words for you here today.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,540
The first three are nouns, and then afterwards we've got a couple of adjectives to describe those nouns.

31
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,500
But first up, we have the word receipt.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,340
That's right.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,980
So we want to return the television, and the worker there asks us if we have the receipt.

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:41,920
Okay.

35
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:49,560
A receipt is a small piece of paper that you receive from a clerk or a server after you buy something.

36
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,480
So if I buy a TV, I will have this small piece of paper that says that I paid $500 for the TV.

37
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,260
That's right.

38
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:05,260
So usually they will ask you for the receipt to see when you bought the product and if you bought the product at that store.

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,099
That's right.

40
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,599
So the receipt has all sorts of information, date, time, method of payment, cost, all those things.

41
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:12,939
Right.

42
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:16,479
And it's very important if you ever want to return something.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,419
Now, later on in the dialogue, the character explains why he wants to return the TV.

44
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,000
Now Marco, why does he want to do that?

45
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,419
Well, he has a problem with the TV when he's watching a movie.

46
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,960
Basically, the image is not very clear.

47
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,819
So this is the keyword image.

48
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:35,379
So image can mean a couple of different things.

49
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,319
You might hear the word image to mean a photograph or a picture, like on a computer.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,819
But in this case, the image is how well you can see the images on TV, the things on TV.

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,520
That's right.

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:53,379
So on TV, it's like you're seeing many, many images all at once or very rapidly together.

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,699
So maybe if you can't see clearly, you say that the image is not clear on the TV.

54
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:00,740
All right.

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,139
So if it's fuzzy, like there's gray and black, the image is not clear.

56
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,219
You can also say that, you know, I really like my new TV.

57
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:09,800
The image is very clear.

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,599
That's right.

59
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:11,539
Okay.

60
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:15,599
And not only are we returning a TV, but we're also returning a keyboard.

61
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,639
All right.

62
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,539
A keyboard, a key is something that you can push.

63
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:28,020
But a keyboard is this thing that you use with your computer to type words.

64
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:28,759
That's right.

65
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,520
So many of you who are using the website as we speak are using a keyboard and a mouse.

66
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,620
So these are probably one of the two most well-known objects when you're using a computer.

67
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,319
That's right.

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,379
And keyboards come in many different shapes and sizes.

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,340
You can buy French keyboards and Russian keyboards.

70
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,319
So keyboard is the general word for this tool.

71
00:03:51,379 --> 00:04:00,180
So we are returning the keyboard and the clerk explains that we can only return it if it is defective, if the product is defective.

72
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:00,819
All right.

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,699
So this is one of those adjectives I talked about a minute ago.

74
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,439
Adjectives describe things.

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,939
So my keyboard is defective or this TV is defective.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,699
That means it doesn't work.

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,520
That's right.

78
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,539
So we have a defective product.

79
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:16,040
It's not working properly.

80
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,519
It has some problem.

81
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,879
And well, the guy was complaining that he didn't understand why these things like the keyboard are so delicate.

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:26,980
All right.

83
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,759
Delicate is something you might see written on the side of a box when you receive a package.

84
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,079
Something that is delicate breaks very easily.

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,639
That's right.

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,459
So you have to handle with care.

87
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,839
So for example, glass is very delicate.

88
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,839
It can break easily.

89
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,279
All right.

90
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,319
Glass is delicate, but stones, a big rock, that's not delicate.

91
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,019
That's right.

92
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,060
All right.

93
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,079
So that's all we have for Language Takeaway.

94
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,220
Let's review everything and listen to our dialogue.

95
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,420
Hi.

96
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,819
I would like to return this TV.

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,060
Sure.

98
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,180
Do you have a receipt?

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:04,860
Yeah.

100
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:05,759
Here you go.

101
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:09,699
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:10,779
Okay.

103
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,660
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

104
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:20,980
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

105
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,040
I see.

106
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:23,819
And what about the keyboard?

107
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,560
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

108
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,339
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

109
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,800
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

110
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,680
Fine.

111
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,459
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

112
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:45,300
All right.

113
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:45,660
We're back.

114
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:50,620
So now let's take a look at a couple of phrases we've picked out for To Be Exact on Fluency Builder.

115
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,480
Fluency Builder.

116
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,240
The first verb we have today here in Fluency Builder is the main verb in today's dialogue, to return.

117
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,879
So I would like to return this TV.

118
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:05,699
Okay.

119
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,899
So when you want to give back a product, you don't say, I want to give back or anything like this.

120
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,319
You say, I want to return this product.

121
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,019
Well, it's not just giving back.

122
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,699
It's giving back and getting your money back.

123
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,279
That's right.

124
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,180
So to return means that you bring back the product and the store will give you back your money.

125
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,339
That's right.

126
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:34,939
And he wanted to return the TV, as we mentioned, because the image was not very clear, but he also mentioned that the TV flickers a lot.

127
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,120
So what is this, to flicker?

128
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,459
To flicker is another verb and flicker is something that things with light do.

129
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,519
The light flickers, the TV flickers.

130
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,100
It means the light comes on and off, on and off, on and off.

131
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,379
So dark light, dark light.

132
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,839
It's not very steady.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,680
It's not like there's light or dark.

134
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,100
And so this is very annoying when you're watching TV because it goes light, dark, light, dark, and it's hard to see what's happening.

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:00,920
Exactly.

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,459
So it's basically, just imagine someone is turning on and off the light all the time.

137
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,379
That's the same thing that's happening with the TV.

138
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,220
It flickers.

139
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:08,860
Exactly.

140
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:14,160
Or like when a light bulb in your lamp, when a light bulb is dying, it flickers.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,920
That's right.

142
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,019
All right.

143
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:26,100
So we wanted to actually return these goods and the clerk explained that we can exchange or we can refund defective products.

144
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:26,720
Okay.

145
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,060
These are two important verbs.

146
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,180
Exchange means to trade one thing for another.

147
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,540
So when I go to a foreign country, I exchange money, right?

148
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,720
I can exchange Japanese yen for American dollars.

149
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,040
Right.

150
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:52,259
But at a store, like an electronics store, I can exchange my TV that I don't like for maybe a really good MP3 player or something like that.

151
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:00,720
So that's what happens usually if maybe your TV is broken or it had some problem, you exchange it for a new one, right?

152
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,899
But maybe you don't want the TV anymore.

153
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,079
Maybe you changed your mind.

154
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,540
So you want to get a refund.

155
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,639
So refund, you hear this word fund, it has to do with money.

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,139
A refund means that the store will give you all your money back.

157
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:24,379
So if I refund my TV, I give my TV to the store, the store gives me $500 or whatever the money for the TV was, and I can buy anything else anywhere else.

158
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,040
That's right.

159
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,699
So this is what happens when you get a refund.

160
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,839
Very different from exchanging the goods.

161
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,399
And finally, the clerk explained that they cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

162
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,799
So remember this as a phrase.

163
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,299
This is really important to take responsibility.

164
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,159
It means that if something goes wrong, you will take responsibility for it.

165
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,460
You will handle it.

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,360
All right.

167
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:55,500
So for example, the store says that it can't take responsibility if something is broken.

168
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,960
That means that they won't pay you back money.

169
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:58,700
That's right.

170
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:08,860
So if you buy a TV and you accidentally get it wet or you get water inside and this is why it gets damaged, then the store cannot take responsibility for this damage.

171
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,480
Or you could say the other way around.

172
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,559
You could say, if you're at the office and you make a mistake on a report, you say, listen, boss, I'm really sorry.

173
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,620
I take full responsibility for this mistake.

174
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,860
You can punish me or you can make me do it again, but I take responsibility means that I say it's my fault.

175
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:27,120
Right.

176
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,840
You're guilty.

177
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:28,840
All right.

178
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,440
So that's all we have for Fluency Builder.

179
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,080
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we can review everything we've just learned.

180
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,080
Hi.

181
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,519
I would like to return this TV.

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:44,899
Sure.

183
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,879
Do you have a receipt?

184
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:46,559
Yeah.

185
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,500
Here you go.

186
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,379
Actually, I also want to return this keyboard.

187
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:52,500
Okay.

188
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,360
May I ask what the reason for returning these products is?

189
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,720
The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.

190
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:03,740
I see.

191
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,519
And what about the keyboard?

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,299
I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work.

193
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,059
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can only exchange or refund defective products.

194
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:18,480
We cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.

195
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:19,440
Fine.

196
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,179
I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways.

197
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:36,940
So returning goods is a very useful thing if you maybe bought a TV at a department store or an electronic store, then you would want to return it if you had some problems.

198
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,539
Now, how easy or difficult is it to do?

199
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,559
Because in theory, in the dialogue, it seems like it's really easy.

200
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,039
It depends on the store, of course.

201
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,399
So some stores make it easier to do this.

202
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,580
Some stores make it harder.

203
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,980
I can tell you in most stores, if you don't have a receipt, it's probably very difficult.

204
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,519
Really?

205
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:55,100
Yes.

206
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,019
But a lot of stores have something else that they sell you or give you when you buy something.

207
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:00,980
It's called a warranty.

208
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,500
And this is something that will help protect you if you take the TV home and you have a problem.

209
00:11:07,179 --> 00:11:12,220
That means that they will come fix it or they will give you a new one without any questions about what happened.

210
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:23,139
Now, not only can you return goods such as TVs, electronics, or maybe clothes, but in some cases also things that you buy at the supermarket, like maybe chicken.

211
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:28,120
I've heard that maybe sometimes you buy chicken and you open it up that same day and it's gone bad.

212
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:28,820
Really?

213
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,320
I've never had that experience, but I think it makes sense.

214
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,639
It depends where you buy it, of course.

215
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:34,019
Right.

216
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,139
Obviously at a supermarket and you show the receipt.

217
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,940
Or maybe milk, maybe that's gone bad sometimes.

218
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,460
Or yogurt.

219
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,580
Well, because they probably shouldn't sell it if it's bad.

220
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,039
Exactly.

221
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,980
So if you tell them that they sold you bad milk, they'll give you a new one.

222
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,620
Exactly.

223
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,840
So that's called an exchange.

224
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,639
You would exchange the bad one for the good one.

225
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:52,820
Right.

226
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,759
You wouldn't get your money back.

227
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:54,559
Maybe.

228
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,100
Maybe not.

229
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,399
Maybe.

230
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,000
All right.

231
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,360
So that's all the time we have for today, but this is actually a very interesting topic because it has to do a lot with customer service.

232
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,240
So let us know what your experience is with customer service with returning something.

233
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,080
Is it very easy, very difficult?

234
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,659
Maybe some stores don't even accept returns.

235
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,980
They say once you buy it, you cannot return it.

236
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,700
All sales final.

237
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:16,720
Yeah, exactly.

238
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,580
So let us know, are refunds or exchanges common where you come from?

239
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,860
And have you ever had a bad experience where you bought something and it didn't work when you got home?

240
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,340
Let us know.

241
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,759
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

242
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:28,000
All right.

243
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,600
We'll see you guys there.

244
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,940
Bye.
