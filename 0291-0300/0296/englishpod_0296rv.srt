Lever.

More and more.

45
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,839
As it gets closer to dinner, I'm feeling more and more hungry.

46
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,439
More and more.

47
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,800
More and more bugs flew into her room.

48
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,980
More and more.

49
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,199
The police were becoming more and more convinced that he was the killer.
