00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,299
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:10,880
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about eating food and certain foods that people don't eat.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,519
That's right.

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,500
So today we have special diets.

6
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:19,640
We're going to talk all about being a vegetarian or a vegan, and we're going to explain all these words when we come back.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,980
So now let's just listen to the dialogue.

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:29,820
Hey, Julie, do you want to go grab something to eat?

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:30,519
Sure.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you feel like having?

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,039
I really feel like having a big, juicy steak.

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,920
Oh, okay.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,079
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.

14
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,340
I'm sure wherever we're going, they will have other options, right?

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,560
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,500
I'm not.

17
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:47,740
I'm a vegan.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,600
A what?

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,520
A vegan.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,520
I don't eat or use any animal-based products.

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,320
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk, or anything that comes from an animal.

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:05,040
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:05,959
Wow.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,819
That's interesting.

25
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:07,959
It must be tough.

26
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:17,439
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

27
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,500
Alright, we're back.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,120
So now, probably a lot of you have an idea of what it means to be a vegetarian, but let's take a look at that word and many more on Language Takeaway.

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,319
Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,920
So a vegetarian is a noun.

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm a vegetarian.

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,120
Vegetarian is a noun.

33
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:42,640
It's a person.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,599
You say, I am a vegetarian.

35
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:46,439
He is a vegetarian.

36
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,879
And in this case, a vegetarian person does not eat meat.

37
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,519
So no chicken, no beef, none of that stuff.

38
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,299
That's right.

39
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,500
So as you can see, it has the prefix veget, like vegetable.

40
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,780
So that's what they eat.

41
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,879
They just eat vegetables.

42
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:16,439
And it's a little bit hard to say what all vegetarians do or don't eat because some people have different rules.

43
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,060
Some people eat eggs, some people don't.

44
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,580
But there is something that is a little bit different from a vegetarian.

45
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,860
It's called a vegan, and this person has many, many rules about what he can or cannot eat.

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,719
Right, so a vegetarian basically does not eat meat.

47
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:44,259
A vegan, as we saw in our dialogue, doesn't wear leather, for example, doesn't wear leather shoes or a jacket or use or eat anything that comes from an animal.

48
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,960
That's right, so no eggs, right?

49
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,939
No foods that might have any animal products in them.

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:03:05,500
So vegans often try to find foods at the grocery store that come from natural products that are not animal-based, and so there has to be a symbol on the back of the box or the jar that says that it's vegan.

51
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,159
That's right.

52
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,819
So in that case, they don't drink milk, they don't eat eggs, nothing that you can think of that comes from an animal.

53
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,800
But on the other hand, this person used to be a pescatarian.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,900
So this is another type of person that has a special diet, very much like a vegetarian.

55
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:29,080
A pescatarian is a person who is a vegetarian but who also eats fish.

56
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:34,159
And so maybe I'm a pescatarian because I don't consider fish to be animals.

57
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,120
So I don't eat lamb, I don't eat chicken, but I do eat fish, I'm a pescatarian.

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:55,360
All right, so a vegetarian does not eat fish or any type of meat, the same as a vegan, but a pescatarian does eat maybe shrimp and fish and any type of animal from the sea.

59
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,780
Okay, and well, that brings us up to our next word.

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,080
A pescatarian will eat seafood.

61
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,039
Seafood is a word we use to describe animals that come from the sea.

62
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,419
So not just fish.

63
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:10,879
Also, like you said, shrimp and lobster.

64
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:18,620
You could even think of really delicious food like a seafood pasta or a seafood salad, octopus, things like that.

65
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,860
Okay, so you got clams, you have oysters.

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,660
Anything that comes from the sea is considered seafood, right?

67
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,360
That's right.

68
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,779
And our last word and language takeaway is an adjective.

69
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,839
We heard at the end of the dialogue, our character said, it must be tough.

70
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,579
Okay, now tough is an interesting word because in English, it has a few different meanings.

71
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,120
But what was the meaning of the word tough in today's dialogue?

72
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,560
In today's dialogue, when the person said it must be tough, it's basically saying it must be difficult.

73
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,379
It must be difficult to be a vegetarian, right?

74
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,980
So it's a hard situation.

75
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,620
You could also say, oh, man, this homework is really tough.

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,040
That means it's hard.

77
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,759
It's difficult.

78
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,240
All right, great.

79
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,500
So we've taken a look at a lot of key words there.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,160
So why don't we take a break, listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

81
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:33,720
What?

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,620
A vegan.

83
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,680
I don't eat or use any animal based products.

84
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,459
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal.

85
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,160
I used to be a pescatarian before which basically means you don't eat meat but still have fish and seafood.

86
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:51,939
Wow, that's interesting.

87
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:53,100
It must be tough.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,560
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

89
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,360
All right, now we've prepared three phrases for you.

90
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,699
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,959
So there's a very interesting and very, very common phrase at the beginning of today's dialogue that we use all the time in English.

92
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,800
This is to grab something to eat.

93
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,680
The character says, hey, Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,399
So taking that as a phrase, we are inviting someone to go eat something.

95
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,879
That's right, so I could say, hey, do you want to go eat something?

96
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,160
Or I could say, hey, do you want to go grab something to eat?

97
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,819
Okay, and the verb grab is to take or to hold in your hand.

98
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,899
So you want to go grab something to eat is basically that.

99
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:59,360
Right, but don't be confused because grabbing normally means holding with your hand but to grab something to eat generally just means, hey, would you like to go eat something with me?

100
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,180
Okay, and of course, we want to go grab something to eat.

101
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,939
And the guy says, I really feel like having a big juicy steak.

102
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,540
So we feel like having a steak.

103
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,620
This is very spoken English.

104
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:16,240
So remember, when you're talking to your friends, this is okay.

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,680
But maybe if you're writing something, it's not as good.

106
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,620
But I feel like a steak means I want to eat a steak.

107
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,639
Right, it doesn't mean you are a steak.

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,399
No, I don't feel like a steak like a piece of meat.

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,240
But I do want to eat a steak.

110
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,120
And so I feel like having or I feel like a steak.

111
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:37,519
These are both acceptable in spoken English.

112
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,899
So you basically feel like doing something or you feel like eating something.

113
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,060
For example, if we're going to have dinner, you can say, I feel like having Italian food.

114
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,279
Yeah, I don't feel like having Italian food tonight.

115
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,160
I feel like having Mexican food.

116
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,879
And I also feel like watching a movie.

117
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:55,519
Exactly.

118
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:01,319
So great ways of using feel like and then a verb like having or watching a movie.

119
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:14,060
Now getting back to the vegetarian, the vegan aspect of our dialogue, we saw that the girl explained how she doesn't eat or use any animal-based products.

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
So these three words, animal-based products.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,220
So product is basically anything that will be sold or bought.

122
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,500
Animal-based is a way to describe a product.

123
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,240
So some products have animal products in them, right?

124
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,220
So for example, my shoes are an animal-based product because they are leather and leather comes from cows, which are animals.

125
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,460
So you're basically saying that they have something from an animal.

126
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,159
They are made up of that something that comes from an animal like leather shoes.

127
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:46,059
Exactly.

128
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,220
And it's not just shoes.

129
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:52,759
It's also shampoo or some of the foods that you eat, like in jars and cans.

130
00:08:52,879 --> 00:09:00,659
And so it's important if you're a vegan to look on the side of the can or the side of the box and see, is this an animal-based product?

131
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,179
Are there animal products in this?

132
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,980
Right, right.

133
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,559
Okay.

134
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,360
A lot of interesting things in this dialogue today.

135
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,320
Why don't we listen to it one last time and we'll be back.

136
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,179
Hey, Julie, do you want to go grab something to eat?

137
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:18,860
Sure.

138
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,340
What do you feel like having?

139
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,399
I really feel like having a big juicy steak.

140
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,279
Oh, okay.

141
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:28,419
I don't eat meat, but that's fine.

142
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,700
I'm sure wherever we're going, they will have other options, right?

143
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,919
I didn't know you were a vegetarian.

144
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,840
I'm not.

145
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
I'm a vegan.

146
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:36,940
A what?

147
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,860
A vegan.

148
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,860
I don't eat or use any animal-based products.

149
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,679
I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk, or anything that comes from an animal.

150
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:53,379
I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.

151
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,159
Wow, that's interesting.

152
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,299
It must be tough.

153
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:05,799
It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it's getting a bit less difficult.

154
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:26,980
All right, so talking about vegan vegetarians, pescatarians, it seems like these diets or these lifestyles are more and more popular, but as we saw in the dialogue, it can be a little bit difficult, especially maybe in countries where it's not so popular to have these diets.

155
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:27,980
Definitely.

156
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:37,840
I think that in places where you can find vegan and vegetarian products very easily, being a vegetarian becomes much more easy because you have more options.

157
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:47,980
But if you're living in a country where it's very hard to eat a meal without having meat, then you might just eat potatoes every day, and that will get very, very difficult and very boring.

158
00:10:48,360 --> 00:11:11,919
Well, that's one of the main arguments or the main concerns with people is that even though you can argue that you can get all the vitamins, or many of the vitamins and minerals from nuts and from vegetables, it's still not healthy to completely exclude from your diet maybe sources of proteins like meat or eggs or dairy products.

159
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:16,740
That's right, and so in America, for example, it's very easy to find supplements.

160
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:26,740
You can take vitamins like calcium, and you can have pills that will give you some protein, and you can find all sorts of exotic vegetables that will help you supplement your diet.

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:37,679
But in a place like China, for example, I think it can be a lot harder to find those products and to find those supplements, and so being a vegan especially or a vegetarian poses a lot more challenges.

162
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:48,399
Especially, I think, with what you mentioned that products are usually labeled, where they tell you if they have any animal-based products in there, whereas in other countries it's probably not labeled.

163
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:56,139
Even things like getting the fat-free things are a little bit more difficult in other countries like, for example, China.

164
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:56,960
That's right.

165
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:02,039
So we would like to know, are there many vegans or vegetarians in your country?

166
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,080
And if there are, do you think it's hard for them to buy food?

167
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,080
Why or why not?

168
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,580
Let us know.
