EnglishPod.com This place has the best sesame chicken.

2
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,079
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

3
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:37,039
I used to get takeout all the time.

4
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,420
It's definitely been a while.

5
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,359
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

6
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,439
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,460
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

8
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:51,539
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,799
It all looks so appetizing.

10
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,460
I think I'll get General Tso's chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,399
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

12
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,500
You should at least get brown rice.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,560
I don't think so.

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,519
I hate brown rice.

15
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,879
And I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,939
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,060
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,280
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,079
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,480
Let's call the waitress over.
