EnglishPod.com This place has the best sesame chicken.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I used to get takeout all the time.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's definitely been a while.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It all looks so appetizing.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I think I'll get General Tso's chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You should at least get brown rice.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't think so.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I hate brown rice.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's call the waitress over.
