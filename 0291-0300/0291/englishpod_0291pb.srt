00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have a delicious lesson all about Chinese food for you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today we are ordering Chinese food.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, for many of you listeners that are actually Chinese, you may not recognize these dishes because we are talking about American Chinese food.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So long, long ago, people came over to America from mainly Hong Kong.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And so a lot of the food we have is kind of more like Hong Kong food.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Cantonese food.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cantonese food.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But it's also very American.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out exactly what we're eating.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Can I get you anything to drink?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Coke for me, please.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll have a Sprite.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Are there any questions with the menu?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you use MSG?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, ma'am.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are MSG-free.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want everything.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This place has the best sesame chicken.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I used to get takeout all the time.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's definitely been a while.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll and egg drop soup.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It all looks so appetizing.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons and white rice.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You should at least get brown rice.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't think so.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, gosh, I'm so hungry.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's call the waitress over.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All right, we're back.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, obviously, everything seems so good.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Very typical American Chinese dishes, and we have a lot of things that we can take a look at.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So let's start with language takeaway.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Language takeaway.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
In language takeaway today, we're going to be talking about some general food words, words that you can use when you're ordering food.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The first one we should talk about is this MSG.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right, Andrea asks, do you use MSG?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So why is she asking this, and what is MSG?

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
MSG is an ingredient in foods.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's kind of like a condiment, something that you put on the food after the food has been cooked, and it makes the food taste better, brighter.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It intensifies the flavors a little bit.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, and it looks like salt or sugar.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's on the tables usually at Chinese restaurants, but a lot of people don't like MSG because they don't think it's very safe for their bodies.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And so, actually, the waitress says that the food is MSG-free, which means there's no MSG in it.

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay, so she says, our food is MSG-free, which is this chemical.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think it's kind of like a chemical that you describe.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right, and a lot of people don't want it, so you can ask, is this food MSG-free?

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can also ask, is it fat-free?

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is it salt-free?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So this is a very helpful way of asking about what the ingredients are in a dish.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right, that's right.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And actually, Manny is talking about the food as well, and he says, yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, so the verb here is to crave, but he said he's been craving, so he really has been wanting this food for a long time.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So if you say, I'm craving Italian food, what does that mean?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That means I really want to eat Italian food.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You feel like having Italian food.

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right, so I'm craving some kind of food, I really want to eat it.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, and he said that he used to get takeout all the time, so he's obviously talking about Chinese food.

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What does he mean by takeout?

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Well, takeout is the opposite of sitting down in a restaurant and eating food.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Takeout is what you do when you want to go home and eat it.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So in many restaurants, you can order the food, and then you go and you pick up the food and you bring it home.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, so that's takeout.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So it's a noun, you get takeout.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right, but it's a little bit different from a different kind of takeout.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's takeout, where you order the food and you pick it up and you bring it home.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But there's also delivery, and delivery is when you order the food and someone else brings it to you, so be careful with those two.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
All right, very good.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And moving forward, Manny kept talking about the food and said, wow, everything on the menu looks so appetizing, it all looks so appetizing.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, appetizing is a way to describe something.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In this case, we're describing food, so that's normally how we use the word appetizing.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So appetizing basically means that you're excited about eating this food because it looks like it will be good.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So what about the word appetizer?

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Does this have anything to do with it?

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I think appetizer is something that makes you want to eat more, that's why it's at the beginning of a meal.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You have your appetizer before you have your main course.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But the word appetizing means that it's very appealing, you really want to eat it.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It looks good, it looks delicious.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, very good.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And Andrea was worried because Manny is ordering so much food, she asks, aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, so this is a phrase and I want to remind everyone to keep this phrase in mind.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can diet, which is a verb, but in this case you're on a diet, so it's a noun.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm on a diet, I'm trying to eat healthily, I'm trying to watch the things that I put in my body.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So usually if you're on a diet, you don't eat really greasy, fatty, takeout Chinese food.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You eat salads and soups.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, so you are on a diet.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yes, he's on a diet, or I was on a diet, but I stopped.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:20,000
All right, a lot of great, appealing food, why don't we go and listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with language takeaway part two, where we're going to take a look at the specific American Chinese dishes.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
All right.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are there any questions with the menu?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you use MSG?

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No ma'am, we are MSG-free.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long, I want everything.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This place has the best sesame chicken.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I used to get takeout all the time.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's definitely been a while.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu, it all looks so appetizing.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You should at least get brown rice.

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't think so, I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry, let's call the waitress over.

126
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at those delicious American Chinese dishes on Language Takeaway Part 2.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Language Takeaway.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And so here we are with a number of delicious and very appetizing dishes.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
These are things that you'll normally find in an American Chinese restaurant.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The first one is called crab rangoon.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay so this doesn't sound very Chinese at all.

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Now a rangoon is actually a city in a country called Myanmar, or Burma.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And crab rangoon is a special deep-fried dish that's like, it's like deep-fried dumplings but on the inside there's cream cheese and crab.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Uh-huh, crab meat.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Alright, so it's kind of, as you said, like a dumpling, but inside you have cream cheese and crab.

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Right.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Alright, very good.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now they also talked about getting the sesame chicken with fried rice.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay so sesame is a very common ingredient in cultures all over the world, and sesame is a kind of seed, but some people also use some sesame oil in their cooking, and so these all come from these white, small seeds, and sesame chicken is a kind of chicken that's cooked with sesame seeds.

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, very good.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And obviously we know what fried rice is, you just take, it's just basically rice in a pan with sometimes a little bit of meat and egg and just fry it all together.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But what about spring rolls, I think these are one of the typical Chinese dishes that everyone knows, and actually it's a Chinese dish as well.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I love spring rolls, although I've never gotten an American spring roll in China.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The spring rolls we're talking about here are basically wrappers, these like wonton wrappers, that are stuffed with meat and vegetables, and they're rolled up, so they look like a long roll, and they're deep fried.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So okay, so spring rolls are, as you said, little rolls with meat and sometimes vegetable inside.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not really sure why they call it spring roll though.

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't know either, maybe it has to do with the ingredients, like they're vegetables from the spring.

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Maybe.

150
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Now another one that I actually really, really like is this egg drop soup.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is delicious.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This is a very simple soup, and when you're cooking it you break an egg, and the egg is mixed into the soup, so it looks like it's kind of got these yellow pieces floating, but it's a really nice simple soup with egg.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay and that's what it's called, egg drop soup.

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Now you mentioned the wonton wrappers, and they also mentioned fried wontons.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What are wontons?

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, wontons are also known as hundun in mainland China, but this is a special kind of dumpling.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's got a piece of dough basically that's flattened out, and inside there's meat, maybe some vegetables, and sometimes you eat it in soup, but here we're talking about fried wontons, deep fried wontons.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So you put them in the deep fryer, and they're fried so that they're crunchy, and the insides are soft.

159
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Actually this is one of my favorite dishes, the original one in China though, as you say, the hundun, because it's like in a soup, and it's very simple, but you have like dumplings in a soup, but the fried ones are also very, very good.

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They are both delicious, and this is making me very hungry, so maybe we should listen to our dialogue again.

161
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Can I get you anything to drink?

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Coke for me please.

164
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll have a Sprite.

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Are there any questions with the menu?

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you use MSG?

168
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No ma'am, we are MSG free.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long, I want everything.

170
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This place has the best sesame chicken.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

172
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I used to get takeout all the time.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's definitely been a while.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It all looks so appetizing.

179
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

181
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You should at least get brown rice.

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't think so.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

185
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's call the waitress over.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Alright, we're back.

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
As we mentioned, these dishes have a certain American influence to them, and they're not really spicy.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think that's the main difference as well, that American Chinese food doesn't really have the intense garlic flavor, nor is it spicy like usual Chinese food.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's right, so I think that part of that is, like I said, due to the fact that a lot of the Chinese Americans who first came over came from Hong Kong, and so Hong Kong food is not as famous for its spiciness, it's not like Sichuan food.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You will see a lot of sweet sauces, like this General Tso's chicken is like a very, very sweet sauce.

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You'll also see a lot of soy sauce in American Chinese cooking, and so these are flavors that are very, very strong, and they're not the same as the Chinese peppers and these spicy foods you get in China.

195
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's right, and actually there's one more dish that we didn't mention in the dialogue actually, but is very famous all around the United States.

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's called chop suey.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Chop suey, and many people have argued about where the name comes from, but chop suey is just basically like everything chopped up and fried together, right?

198
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's like stir-fried vegetables and meat, and all put together in just a bowl.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah, well my favorite thing about the American Chinese food that we get is that we get it in these little boxes.

200
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
They're very cute, and you take them home and you open them up, and every food has a box.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And then at the end, you also get a fortune cookie, which is a very small cookie, and inside there's a piece of paper, so don't eat the paper, and the paper has a fortune for you.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It says, you know, you will be very lucky today, or your favorite number is 17, and they're very cute.

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Actually, you can see these boxes that Catherine mentions on our lesson page.

204
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's the lesson photo, and it's, as you said, very, very common.

205
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Each dish is put in this little box, so if you ever get Chinese food, you'll see people carrying these little boxes around, because they're very convenient and easy to carry.

206
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But the fortune cookie thing is also very common.

207
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I was actually very surprised when I went to China and there were no fortune cookies.

208
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's weird, isn't it?

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think it's funny because we expect these things to be very Chinese, but in fact, when you come to mainland China, they don't have fortune cookies, so I think it's a nice surprise, but also kind of confusing.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's right.

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, a very interesting topic, and in the future we're going to continue doing different lessons about different cuisines.

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We have Italian food coming up sometime soon, so that's going to be very good as well.

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And of course, if you have any lesson suggestions, or maybe you want to suggest the cuisine from your country, you can visit our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your comments there.

214
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We hope to see you guys there, and until next time, bye.
