00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:04,019
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:04,740
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:10,039
My name is Katherine, and today we have a delicious lesson all about Chinese food for you.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,699
That's right.

5
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:12,720
Today we are ordering Chinese food.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:20,140
Now, for many of you listeners that are actually Chinese, you may not recognize these dishes because we are talking about American Chinese food.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,699
That's right.

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,620
So long, long ago, people came over to America from mainly Hong Kong.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,800
And so a lot of the food we have is kind of more like Hong Kong food.

10
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:29,500
Cantonese food.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,320
Cantonese food.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,460
But it's also very American.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,299
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out exactly what we're eating.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,640
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

15
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:45,240
Can I get you anything to drink?

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,719
Coke for me, please.

17
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,659
I'll have a Sprite.

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,359
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

19
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,159
Are there any questions with the menu?

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,719
Do you use MSG?

21
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:54,899
No, ma'am.

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,119
We are MSG-free.

23
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,820
Oh, man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long.

24
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:05,079
I want everything.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,140
This place has the best sesame chicken.

26
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:11,140
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

27
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,120
I used to get takeout all the time.

28
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:14,500
It's definitely been a while.

29
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,400
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

30
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:18,519
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.

31
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,480
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll and egg drop soup.

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,620
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

33
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,859
It all looks so appetizing.

34
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,540
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons and white rice.

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,480
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,599
You should at least get brown rice.

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,659
I don't think so.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,959
I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,040
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,140
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

41
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,379
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

42
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,159
Oh, gosh, I'm so hungry.

43
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,659
Let's call the waitress over.

44
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,379
All right, we're back.

45
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,599
So, obviously, everything seems so good.

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,759
Very typical American Chinese dishes, and we have a lot of things that we can take a look at.

47
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,419
So let's start with language takeaway.

48
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,599
Language takeaway.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,340
In language takeaway today, we're going to be talking about some general food words, words that you can use when you're ordering food.

50
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,400
The first one we should talk about is this MSG.

51
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,379
Right, Andrea asks, do you use MSG?

52
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,759
So why is she asking this, and what is MSG?

53
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,460
MSG is an ingredient in foods.

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,680
It's kind of like a condiment, something that you put on the food after the food has been cooked, and it makes the food taste better, brighter.

55
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,639
It intensifies the flavors a little bit.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,300
Yeah, and it looks like salt or sugar.

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,740
It's on the tables usually at Chinese restaurants, but a lot of people don't like MSG because they don't think it's very safe for their bodies.

58
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,479
And so, actually, the waitress says that the food is MSG-free, which means there's no MSG in it.

59
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,280
That's right.

60
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,180
Okay, so she says, our food is MSG-free, which is this chemical.

61
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:11,439
I think it's kind of like a chemical that you describe.

62
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:16,539
That's right, and a lot of people don't want it, so you can ask, is this food MSG-free?

63
00:03:16,539 --> 00:03:18,759
You can also ask, is it fat-free?

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,639
Is it salt-free?

65
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,759
So this is a very helpful way of asking about what the ingredients are in a dish.

66
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right, that's right.

67
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:33,240
And actually, Manny is talking about the food as well, and he says, yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

68
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:41,180
Okay, so the verb here is to crave, but he said he's been craving, so he really has been wanting this food for a long time.

69
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:45,020
So if you say, I'm craving Italian food, what does that mean?

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,939
That means I really want to eat Italian food.

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,740
You feel like having Italian food.

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,719
That's right, so I'm craving some kind of food, I really want to eat it.

73
00:03:53,919 --> 00:04:01,580
Okay, and he said that he used to get takeout all the time, so he's obviously talking about Chinese food.

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,780
What does he mean by takeout?

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,840
Well, takeout is the opposite of sitting down in a restaurant and eating food.

76
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,280
Takeout is what you do when you want to go home and eat it.

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,199
So in many restaurants, you can order the food, and then you go and you pick up the food and you bring it home.

78
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,180
Okay, so that's takeout.

79
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,319
So it's a noun, you get takeout.

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,199
Right, but it's a little bit different from a different kind of takeout.

81
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:31,079
There's takeout, where you order the food and you pick it up and you bring it home.

82
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:38,100
But there's also delivery, and delivery is when you order the food and someone else brings it to you, so be careful with those two.

83
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:39,199
All right, very good.

84
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:50,920
And moving forward, Manny kept talking about the food and said, wow, everything on the menu looks so appetizing, it all looks so appetizing.

85
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:54,079
Okay, appetizing is a way to describe something.

86
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,420
In this case, we're describing food, so that's normally how we use the word appetizing.

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,779
So appetizing basically means that you're excited about eating this food because it looks like it will be good.

88
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,300
So what about the word appetizer?

89
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,819
Does this have anything to do with it?

90
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:14,420
I think appetizer is something that makes you want to eat more, that's why it's at the beginning of a meal.

91
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,879
You have your appetizer before you have your main course.

92
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,819
But the word appetizing means that it's very appealing, you really want to eat it.

93
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,220
It looks good, it looks delicious.

94
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:26,980
Okay, very good.

95
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:34,199
And Andrea was worried because Manny is ordering so much food, she asks, aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

96
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,660
Okay, so this is a phrase and I want to remind everyone to keep this phrase in mind.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,819
You can diet, which is a verb, but in this case you're on a diet, so it's a noun.

98
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:52,459
I'm on a diet, I'm trying to eat healthily, I'm trying to watch the things that I put in my body.

99
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,399
So usually if you're on a diet, you don't eat really greasy, fatty, takeout Chinese food.

100
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,959
You eat salads and soups.

101
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,779
Okay, so you are on a diet.

102
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,699
Yes, he's on a diet, or I was on a diet, but I stopped.

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:20,480
All right, a lot of great, appealing food, why don't we go and listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with language takeaway part two, where we're going to take a look at the specific American Chinese dishes.

104
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,180
All right.

105
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,800
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

106
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,579
Are there any questions with the menu?

107
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:37,980
Do you use MSG?

108
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,540
No ma'am, we are MSG-free.

109
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:49,500
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long, I want everything.

110
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,579
This place has the best sesame chicken.

111
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,600
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

112
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,560
I used to get takeout all the time.

113
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,939
It's definitely been a while.

114
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,839
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

115
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,920
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,980
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

117
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,319
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu, it all looks so appetizing.

118
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,959
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

119
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,920
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

120
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,040
You should at least get brown rice.

121
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,399
I don't think so, I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

122
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,480
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

123
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:37,579
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,779
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,100
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry, let's call the waitress over.

126
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,100
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at those delicious American Chinese dishes on Language Takeaway Part 2.

127
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,379
Language Takeaway.

128
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,579
And so here we are with a number of delicious and very appetizing dishes.

129
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,519
These are things that you'll normally find in an American Chinese restaurant.

130
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,279
The first one is called crab rangoon.

131
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,560
Okay so this doesn't sound very Chinese at all.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,980
Now a rangoon is actually a city in a country called Myanmar, or Burma.

133
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:27,720
And crab rangoon is a special deep-fried dish that's like, it's like deep-fried dumplings but on the inside there's cream cheese and crab.

134
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,060
Uh-huh, crab meat.

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:29,740
That's right.

136
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,279
Alright, so it's kind of, as you said, like a dumpling, but inside you have cream cheese and crab.

137
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,059
Right.

138
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,039
Alright, very good.

139
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,340
Now they also talked about getting the sesame chicken with fried rice.

140
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:58,580
Okay so sesame is a very common ingredient in cultures all over the world, and sesame is a kind of seed, but some people also use some sesame oil in their cooking, and so these all come from these white, small seeds, and sesame chicken is a kind of chicken that's cooked with sesame seeds.

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,759
Okay, very good.

142
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:09,899
And obviously we know what fried rice is, you just take, it's just basically rice in a pan with sometimes a little bit of meat and egg and just fry it all together.

143
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,700
But what about spring rolls, I think these are one of the typical Chinese dishes that everyone knows, and actually it's a Chinese dish as well.

144
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,419
I love spring rolls, although I've never gotten an American spring roll in China.

145
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:36,639
The spring rolls we're talking about here are basically wrappers, these like wonton wrappers, that are stuffed with meat and vegetables, and they're rolled up, so they look like a long roll, and they're deep fried.

146
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:43,440
So okay, so spring rolls are, as you said, little rolls with meat and sometimes vegetable inside.

147
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,700
Not really sure why they call it spring roll though.

148
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,539
I don't know either, maybe it has to do with the ingredients, like they're vegetables from the spring.

149
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:52,200
Maybe.

150
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,799
Now another one that I actually really, really like is this egg drop soup.

151
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:57,879
This is delicious.

152
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:11,659
This is a very simple soup, and when you're cooking it you break an egg, and the egg is mixed into the soup, so it looks like it's kind of got these yellow pieces floating, but it's a really nice simple soup with egg.

153
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay and that's what it's called, egg drop soup.

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,840
Now you mentioned the wonton wrappers, and they also mentioned fried wontons.

155
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,200
What are wontons?

156
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:29,759
Okay, wontons are also known as hundun in mainland China, but this is a special kind of dumpling.

157
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:40,860
It's got a piece of dough basically that's flattened out, and inside there's meat, maybe some vegetables, and sometimes you eat it in soup, but here we're talking about fried wontons, deep fried wontons.

158
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,720
So you put them in the deep fryer, and they're fried so that they're crunchy, and the insides are soft.

159
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:59,960
Actually this is one of my favorite dishes, the original one in China though, as you say, the hundun, because it's like in a soup, and it's very simple, but you have like dumplings in a soup, but the fried ones are also very, very good.

160
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,840
They are both delicious, and this is making me very hungry, so maybe we should listen to our dialogue again.

161
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:12,320
Hi, welcome to Happy Buddha.

162
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,919
Can I get you anything to drink?

163
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,419
Coke for me please.

164
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:16,340
I'll have a Sprite.

165
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,080
Okay, I'll go get that for you.

166
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,840
Are there any questions with the menu?

167
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,220
Do you use MSG?

168
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,840
No ma'am, we are MSG free.

169
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,759
Oh man, I haven't had Chinese food in so long, I want everything.

170
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,840
This place has the best sesame chicken.

171
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,860
Yeah, I've been craving Chinese for such a long time.

172
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:41,820
I used to get takeout all the time.

173
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,220
It's definitely been a while.

174
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,120
Let's start off with some crab rangoon.

175
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,179
Oh yeah, that sounds good.

176
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,240
I think I'm going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.

177
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,299
It's so tempting to order everything on the menu.

178
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,559
It all looks so appetizing.

179
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,200
I think I'll get general toast chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.

180
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,179
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?

181
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,259
You should at least get brown rice.

182
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,360
I don't think so.

183
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,639
I hate brown rice, and I'm so sick of eating healthy all the time.

184
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,720
I've been eating so much salad, I swear I've forgotten what meat tastes like.

185
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,820
There's no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorie-laden Chinese food.

186
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,059
I might even get an order of broccoli beef.

187
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,860
Oh gosh, I'm so hungry.

188
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,320
Let's call the waitress over.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,120
Alright, we're back.

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,740
As we mentioned, these dishes have a certain American influence to them, and they're not really spicy.

191
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:49,440
I think that's the main difference as well, that American Chinese food doesn't really have the intense garlic flavor, nor is it spicy like usual Chinese food.

192
00:12:49,779 --> 00:13:03,980
That's right, so I think that part of that is, like I said, due to the fact that a lot of the Chinese Americans who first came over came from Hong Kong, and so Hong Kong food is not as famous for its spiciness, it's not like Sichuan food.

193
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,899
You will see a lot of sweet sauces, like this General Tso's chicken is like a very, very sweet sauce.

194
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:22,740
You'll also see a lot of soy sauce in American Chinese cooking, and so these are flavors that are very, very strong, and they're not the same as the Chinese peppers and these spicy foods you get in China.

195
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,720
That's right, and actually there's one more dish that we didn't mention in the dialogue actually, but is very famous all around the United States.

196
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
It's called chop suey.

197
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:40,779
Chop suey, and many people have argued about where the name comes from, but chop suey is just basically like everything chopped up and fried together, right?

198
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,580
It's like stir-fried vegetables and meat, and all put together in just a bowl.

199
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:52,960
Yeah, well my favorite thing about the American Chinese food that we get is that we get it in these little boxes.

200
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:56,740
They're very cute, and you take them home and you open them up, and every food has a box.

201
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:06,419
And then at the end, you also get a fortune cookie, which is a very small cookie, and inside there's a piece of paper, so don't eat the paper, and the paper has a fortune for you.

202
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,679
It says, you know, you will be very lucky today, or your favorite number is 17, and they're very cute.

203
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,120
Actually, you can see these boxes that Catherine mentions on our lesson page.

204
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,879
It's the lesson photo, and it's, as you said, very, very common.

205
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:29,000
Each dish is put in this little box, so if you ever get Chinese food, you'll see people carrying these little boxes around, because they're very convenient and easy to carry.

206
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,220
But the fortune cookie thing is also very common.

207
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,500
I was actually very surprised when I went to China and there were no fortune cookies.

208
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:36,500
It's weird, isn't it?

209
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:47,500
I think it's funny because we expect these things to be very Chinese, but in fact, when you come to mainland China, they don't have fortune cookies, so I think it's a nice surprise, but also kind of confusing.

210
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,240
That's right.

211
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,700
Well, a very interesting topic, and in the future we're going to continue doing different lessons about different cuisines.

212
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,019
We have Italian food coming up sometime soon, so that's going to be very good as well.

213
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:05,639
And of course, if you have any lesson suggestions, or maybe you want to suggest the cuisine from your country, you can visit our website, EnglishPod.com, and leave your comments there.

214
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,259
We hope to see you guys there, and until next time, bye.
