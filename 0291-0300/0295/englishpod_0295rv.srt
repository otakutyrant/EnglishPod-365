2
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,900
Now say the word and hear it in a sentence.

3
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:37,579
Impress.

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,239
He is trying really hard to impress her, but she doesn't seem to notice.

5
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:51,920
Impress.

6
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,920
She was really impressed with the progress we had made while she was gone.

7
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,459
Impress.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,340
I think you will be impressed by the developments in our company.

9
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,939
Wrap up.

10
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,800
Let me wrap up my work before we go out to dinner.

11
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,419
Wrap up.

12
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,280
Well, that just about wraps it up.

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,219
Any questions?

14
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Wrap up.

15
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:49,379
He wrapped up the discussion with the Q&A session.

16
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,479
At the outset.

17
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,960
He expressed his feelings at the outset, but no one listened to him.

18
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,020
At the outset.

19
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,879
I should have stated my objections at the outset before we started working.

20
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,120
At the outset.

21
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,139
She made her intentions known at the outset, so there wouldn't be any misunderstanding.

22
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,360
Boom.

23
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,360
Boom.

24
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:47,479
Even though we are going through hard financial times, some businesses are booming.

25
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:50,560
Boom.

26
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,520
He bought a lot of houses when the economy was booming, but now he is deep in debt.

27
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,520
Boom.

28
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,520
The demand for the new iPhones is booming.

29
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,120
Sum up.

30
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,319
Let's sum up the key points we've agreed on so far.

31
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,639
Sum up.

32
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,339
I think this poem accurately sums up my feelings.

33
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:41,939
Sum up.

34
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,519
I didn't get to watch the news this morning.

35
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,740
Can you sum up the top stories for me?
