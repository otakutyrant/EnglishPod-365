2
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now say the word and hear it in a sentence.

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Impress.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He is trying really hard to impress her, but she doesn't seem to notice.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Impress.

6
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She was really impressed with the progress we had made while she was gone.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Impress.

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think you will be impressed by the developments in our company.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Wrap up.

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let me wrap up my work before we go out to dinner.

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Wrap up.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, that just about wraps it up.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Any questions?

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Wrap up.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He wrapped up the discussion with the Q&A session.

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
At the outset.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He expressed his feelings at the outset, but no one listened to him.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
At the outset.

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I should have stated my objections at the outset before we started working.

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
At the outset.

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She made her intentions known at the outset, so there wouldn't be any misunderstanding.

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Boom.

23
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Boom.

24
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Even though we are going through hard financial times, some businesses are booming.

25
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Boom.

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He bought a lot of houses when the economy was booming, but now he is deep in debt.

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Boom.

28
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The demand for the new iPhones is booming.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sum up.

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's sum up the key points we've agreed on so far.

31
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Sum up.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think this poem accurately sums up my feelings.

33
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sum up.

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I didn't get to watch the news this morning.

35
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Can you sum up the top stories for me?
