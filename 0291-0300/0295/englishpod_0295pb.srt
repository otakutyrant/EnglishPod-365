00:00:01,239 --> 00:00:03,359
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,120
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:11,460
My name is Katherine, and here today we have almost, almost to the end of our series on giving a presentation in English.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:22,940
This is part nine of ten, so this is near the end, but we've got a lot of really great words and phrases for discussing what you've talked about in the last, I don't know, ten minutes or so.

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
It's the summary of your speech, and so that's what we're going to talk about today.

6
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,219
That's right.

7
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,879
So let's take a look at what Mr.

8
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,899
Ford is saying in his summary, and we'll be back in a bit.

9
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:26,400
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,739
Once we establish the X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

11
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,680
Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement.

12
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,579
I really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and service.

13
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:55,939
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.

14
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,500
As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

15
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,620
Well, in fact, our customers are looking.

16
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,819
They're looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

17
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,479
We cannot let them down.

18
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,259
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some language on language takeaway.

19
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,819
Language takeaway.

20
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,280
So, Marco, at the very beginning of today's monologue, we have a phrase that basically means the same thing as summarize.

21
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:32,319
What was that phrase?

22
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:32,939
That's right.

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,979
At the last sentence of the first paragraph, we see Mr.

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,879
Ford say, let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,020
So the phrase there is wrap up.

26
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,460
That means to conclude, to finish, to end.

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
This is the very end of his speech.

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,879
And so to wrap something up means to finish it.

29
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,419
That's right.

30
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,199
So maybe if you're giving a speech and someone is telling you to wrap it up quickly.

31
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,199
That means stop.

32
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:57,960
That's right.

33
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,580
Please find an ending point.

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,280
Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,259
So wrap it up.

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,879
Let's go.

37
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:02,439
Come on.

38
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,379
That's right.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,840
So he's wrapping it up by summarizing what he has talked about.

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,300
And so he goes back to the very beginning and he says, as I mentioned at the outset.

41
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,400
Okay, the outset is a noun, it's a time, and it means the beginning.

42
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:25,500
So you might remember in parts one or two of this speech that he was talking about why 2010 is an important year for their company.

43
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,060
And so this is the outset.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,879
This is the beginning.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,599
You can also say, you know, at the outset, things looked bad, but it turns out that they went well.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,460
Okay.

47
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,280
So outset means beginning the start of something.

48
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,120
Okay.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,740
And he also talked about how the computer industry demand is booming.

50
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:44,879
All right.

51
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:50,719
So booming is an interesting word because boom, the noun means boom, a sound.

52
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:51,719
Right.

53
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,719
It's a sound that you hear when there's a storm.

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,460
But booming means doing very well.

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,259
That means that in this case, demand is booming.

56
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,199
There is a lot of demand.

57
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,060
That's right.

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,439
So when you hear people say business is booming.

59
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,560
That means business is going very well.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,580
It's very successful.

61
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,300
Okay.

62
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,639
So it basically means that it's doing very well, that it's growing quickly and rapidly.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:26,980
So he went on to talk about the X420 and how the company has plans to keep expanding and keep coming out with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:27,920
Okay.

65
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,199
So something is revolutionary if it changes a situation.

66
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:37,899
Because revolution basically means change, but not a small change, a really big change.

67
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:43,600
And so a product is revolutionary if it introduces something really new, really exciting.

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,199
Okay.

69
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,519
So an example of a revolutionary product was the home computer.

70
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:49,540
Exactly.

71
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:57,019
Because the home computer changed the way people typed and communicated and did all these different things.

72
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,300
And so it's revolutionary because it introduced a big change.

73
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:00,959
That's right.

74
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:01,399
Okay.

75
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,980
So revolutionary.

76
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,540
Towards the end of Mr.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,959
Ford's dialogue, he said that they're going to have a Q&A section.

78
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,060
And he left us with a quote that, according to him, sums up everything we've discussed today.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay.

80
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,120
To sum up.

81
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,939
This is very related to the word to summarize.

82
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,199
It means to say in fewer words.

83
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,379
Okay.

84
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,560
So this quote says what he wants to say, but it says it in a very short space.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,139
So if we read a book and I ask you to sum up the story, this is basically, I'm asking for a summary.

86
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

87
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:44,000
So I could say, you know, the Harry Potter story is a story about a young boy who is a wizard who loses his parents, who goes to school with his friends and learns about his powers.

88
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,720
That's a perfect way to sum up the Harry Potter story.

89
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:48,120
All right.

90
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:48,959
Very good.

91
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,579
So that's about it for language takeaway today, but we have some great phrases coming up for you in Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:57,560
Let's listen to the dialogue again first, and we'll be back in a moment.

93
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:29,279
It's clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.

94
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:37,180
If we are to succeed in this ultra-competitive field, then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels.

95
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:43,540
As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.

96
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:52,079
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

97
00:06:52,079 --> 00:07:00,399
Once we establish the X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

98
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,339
Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement.

99
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,240
I really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and service.

100
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,939
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've discussed today.

101
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:21,600
And hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.

102
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,160
As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

103
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,240
Well, in fact, our customers are looking.

104
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,459
They're looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

105
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,139
We cannot let them down.

106
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:46,420
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

107
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:48,699
Fluency Builder.

108
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:58,779
So the first phrase we've got here in Fluency Builder is an interesting one, and I think it's important to point out because we've got a verb and a noun that often go together.

109
00:07:59,540 --> 00:07:59,699
Mr.

110
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:06,639
Ford said this kind of computer can really satisfy those needs that customers have.

111
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,459
That's right.

112
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,600
So the phrase there is to satisfy a need, and as you said, this verb and this noun usually go together.

113
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,079
You want to satisfy your customers' needs.

114
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,019
All right, so what do I need?

115
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,540
I need a good computer that is fast that I can do my business on.

116
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,959
And this computer, the X420, satisfies that need.

117
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,319
It does what I need it to do.

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:42,779
Okay, so we understand the verb to satisfy, but the phrase is a very powerful phrase, especially if you use it in business where you're saying we are giving our customers what they need and we are making them happy.

119
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:43,399
Exactly.

120
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,039
Okay.

121
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:49,100
As he continued talking about the X420, he said this is just the beginning.

122
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,379
All right, so this is something we often say when we have a long project or plan.

123
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,059
You can say, yes, things are good now, but this is just the beginning.

124
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,620
There are many good things to come, and this is something we often say in a positive way.

125
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:08,019
Yes, this is good, but expect better things in the future.

126
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:08,700
Very good.

127
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, so this is just the beginning.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,899
And, well, as he continued talking about the company, he said that the customers are looking for us to lead the way.

129
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:42,279
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase because he's making a comparison with other companies and he's saying, listen, our customers have many needs, but they want us to really be ahead of them and to innovate and to make new things and new computers that will be ahead of the competition.

130
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,340
So take the lead.

131
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,240
Be in the front.

132
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:51,620
So basically the phrase to lead the way is for you to be in the front and give people a clear path.

133
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,659
Think of your saying Bolt, that runner.

134
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,240
In the Olympics, everyone's running quickly, but all of a sudden he takes the lead.

135
00:09:58,379 --> 00:09:59,740
He leads the way.

136
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,700
He is ahead of everyone else.

137
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,980
All the other runners are far, far behind him.

138
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,679
That's right.

139
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,279
Okay, so he's leading the way.

140
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,899
And he finishes his monologue by saying, we cannot let them down.

141
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:13,200
We cannot let our customers down, basically.

142
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,080
So the phrase here is to let someone down.

143
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,559
He let me down.

144
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,139
We let them down.

145
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,759
This is a great phrase and you can use it about anybody.

146
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,980
And it's a really important phrase because it means to disappoint someone.

147
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,159
So for example, Marco, when you forgot my birthday, you really let me down.

148
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:35,080
So that means I disappointed you because I forgot your birthday.

149
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:44,360
To let someone down is to disappoint them to not do what you were expected to do.

150
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,019
Exactly.

151
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,700
And so a company can do this.

152
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,879
For example, when a company like Toyota makes a car that has many problems, that company lets down its customers.

153
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,980
So you can let someone down.

154
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,460
Basically, you have to have the subject.

155
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,740
You let someone down or the company let down its customers.

156
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:03,320
Exactly.

157
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,120
Okay.

158
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,799
A lot of great stuff here.

159
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,419
Why don't we take one last listen and we'll be back in a bit.

160
00:11:13,859 --> 00:11:14,779
Right, everyone.

161
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,139
I apologize that I can't show you the marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the opportunity to see it for yourselves.

162
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,019
And I have no doubt that you will be impressed.

163
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,879
Let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

164
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,480
As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for alpha computers.

165
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,960
The recession is hopefully behind us.

166
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:40,159
It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.

167
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,019
If we are to succeed in this ultra-competitive field, then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels.

168
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,379
As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.

169
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,919
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420 range and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

170
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:11,240
Once we establish the X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

171
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,200
Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement.

172
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,100
I really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and service.

173
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,740
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've discussed today.

174
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,460
And hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.

175
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,019
As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

176
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:40,100
Well, in fact, our customers are looking.

177
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,340
They're looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

178
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,860
We cannot let them down.

179
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:57,440
All right, guys, so this is the penultimate lesson about presentation skills.

180
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:12,659
As you saw, we are summarizing and concluding the presentation and there are actually a lot of great things here to learn from, especially the vocab where you're saying, okay, to sum things up, to wrap it up, to conclude, to summarize.

181
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,379
Summarize the key points, yeah.

182
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,700
But there are also some important things coming up next week.

183
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:25,279
That's the very, very last part of this series because usually after a presentation, there is a section for questions and answers.

184
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,659
That's called Q&A and that's the topic of our next show, so you guys should stay tuned for that.

185
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:35,460
All right, so we'll see you guys next time and, of course, if you have any questions or comments, you will always find us at EnglishPod.com.

186
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,200
See you guys there.

187
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:36,500
Bye.

188
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:36,899
Bye.
