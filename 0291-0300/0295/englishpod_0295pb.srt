00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Katherine, and here today we have almost, almost to the end of our series on giving a presentation in English.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is part nine of ten, so this is near the end, but we've got a lot of really great words and phrases for discussing what you've talked about in the last, I don't know, ten minutes or so.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's the summary of your speech, and so that's what we're going to talk about today.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's take a look at what Mr.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ford is saying in his summary, and we'll be back in a bit.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Once we establish the X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and service.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, in fact, our customers are looking.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They're looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We cannot let them down.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some language on language takeaway.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Language takeaway.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So, Marco, at the very beginning of today's monologue, we have a phrase that basically means the same thing as summarize.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What was that phrase?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
At the last sentence of the first paragraph, we see Mr.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ford say, let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So the phrase there is wrap up.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That means to conclude, to finish, to end.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is the very end of his speech.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And so to wrap something up means to finish it.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So maybe if you're giving a speech and someone is telling you to wrap it up quickly.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That means stop.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please find an ending point.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So wrap it up.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So he's wrapping it up by summarizing what he has talked about.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And so he goes back to the very beginning and he says, as I mentioned at the outset.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, the outset is a noun, it's a time, and it means the beginning.

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So you might remember in parts one or two of this speech that he was talking about why 2010 is an important year for their company.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And so this is the outset.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is the beginning.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can also say, you know, at the outset, things looked bad, but it turns out that they went well.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So outset means beginning the start of something.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay.

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And he also talked about how the computer industry demand is booming.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
All right.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So booming is an interesting word because boom, the noun means boom, a sound.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Right.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a sound that you hear when there's a storm.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But booming means doing very well.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That means that in this case, demand is booming.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There is a lot of demand.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So when you hear people say business is booming.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That means business is going very well.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's very successful.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So it basically means that it's doing very well, that it's growing quickly and rapidly.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So he went on to talk about the X420 and how the company has plans to keep expanding and keep coming out with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So something is revolutionary if it changes a situation.

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because revolution basically means change, but not a small change, a really big change.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And so a product is revolutionary if it introduces something really new, really exciting.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So an example of a revolutionary product was the home computer.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Exactly.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Because the home computer changed the way people typed and communicated and did all these different things.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And so it's revolutionary because it introduced a big change.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So revolutionary.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Towards the end of Mr.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Ford's dialogue, he said that they're going to have a Q&A section.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And he left us with a quote that, according to him, sums up everything we've discussed today.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
To sum up.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is very related to the word to summarize.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It means to say in fewer words.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So this quote says what he wants to say, but it says it in a very short space.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So if we read a book and I ask you to sum up the story, this is basically, I'm asking for a summary.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So I could say, you know, the Harry Potter story is a story about a young boy who is a wizard who loses his parents, who goes to school with his friends and learns about his powers.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's a perfect way to sum up the Harry Potter story.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Very good.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So that's about it for language takeaway today, but we have some great phrases coming up for you in Fluency Builder.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again first, and we'll be back in a moment.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If we are to succeed in this ultra-competitive field, then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Once we establish the X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Alpha Computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and service.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've discussed today.

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, in fact, our customers are looking.

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They're looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We cannot let them down.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Fluency Builder.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So the first phrase we've got here in Fluency Builder is an interesting one, and I think it's important to point out because we've got a verb and a noun that often go together.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mr.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ford said this kind of computer can really satisfy those needs that customers have.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So the phrase there is to satisfy a need, and as you said, this verb and this noun usually go together.

113
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You want to satisfy your customers' needs.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All right, so what do I need?

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I need a good computer that is fast that I can do my business on.

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And this computer, the X420, satisfies that need.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It does what I need it to do.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, so we understand the verb to satisfy, but the phrase is a very powerful phrase, especially if you use it in business where you're saying we are giving our customers what they need and we are making them happy.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Exactly.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

121
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
As he continued talking about the X420, he said this is just the beginning.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
All right, so this is something we often say when we have a long project or plan.

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You can say, yes, things are good now, but this is just the beginning.

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There are many good things to come, and this is something we often say in a positive way.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes, this is good, but expect better things in the future.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Very good.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, so this is just the beginning.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And, well, as he continued talking about the company, he said that the customers are looking for us to lead the way.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase because he's making a comparison with other companies and he's saying, listen, our customers have many needs, but they want us to really be ahead of them and to innovate and to make new things and new computers that will be ahead of the competition.

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So take the lead.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Be in the front.

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So basically the phrase to lead the way is for you to be in the front and give people a clear path.

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Think of your saying Bolt, that runner.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
In the Olympics, everyone's running quickly, but all of a sudden he takes the lead.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He leads the way.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He is ahead of everyone else.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All the other runners are far, far behind him.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's right.

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, so he's leading the way.

140
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And he finishes his monologue by saying, we cannot let them down.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We cannot let our customers down, basically.

142
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So the phrase here is to let someone down.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He let me down.

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We let them down.

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This is a great phrase and you can use it about anybody.

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And it's a really important phrase because it means to disappoint someone.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So for example, Marco, when you forgot my birthday, you really let me down.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So that means I disappointed you because I forgot your birthday.

149
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
To let someone down is to disappoint them to not do what you were expected to do.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Exactly.

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And so a company can do this.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For example, when a company like Toyota makes a car that has many problems, that company lets down its customers.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you can let someone down.

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Basically, you have to have the subject.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You let someone down or the company let down its customers.

156
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Exactly.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
A lot of great stuff here.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Why don't we take one last listen and we'll be back in a bit.

160
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Right, everyone.

161
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I apologize that I can't show you the marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the opportunity to see it for yourselves.

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And I have no doubt that you will be impressed.

163
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let me wrap up the presentation by summarizing my key points.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for alpha computers.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The recession is hopefully behind us.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If we are to succeed in this ultra-competitive field, then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels.

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
As I hope I've illustrated, the X420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new X420 range and believe me, this is really just the beginning.

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Once we establish the X420 in the market, we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement.

172
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I really see no limit in our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier, quality, excellence, and service.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Before we move on to the Q&A section, I'd really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we've discussed today.

174
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.

175
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
As the great Henry Ford once said, quality means doing it right when no one is looking.

176
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Well, in fact, our customers are looking.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
They're looking for us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We cannot let them down.

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
All right, guys, so this is the penultimate lesson about presentation skills.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:12,000
As you saw, we are summarizing and concluding the presentation and there are actually a lot of great things here to learn from, especially the vocab where you're saying, okay, to sum things up, to wrap it up, to conclude, to summarize.

181
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Summarize the key points, yeah.

182
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But there are also some important things coming up next week.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's the very, very last part of this series because usually after a presentation, there is a section for questions and answers.

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's called Q&A and that's the topic of our next show, so you guys should stay tuned for that.

185
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
All right, so we'll see you guys next time and, of course, if you have any questions or comments, you will always find us at EnglishPod.com.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
See you guys there.

187
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Bye.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Bye.
