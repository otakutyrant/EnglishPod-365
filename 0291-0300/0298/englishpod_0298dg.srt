00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:13,000
EnglishPod.com Well, everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sincere thanks, Michael.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, I'm sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions, so I'd like to open up a Q&A session.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes, Janice, go ahead.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, thank you, Jonathan.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I would just like to go back to the comment Mr.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Now, as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end laptop market.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How does Mr.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think you have hit the nail on the head, actually.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle, but don't forget who won that contest.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Mr.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ford, could you elaborate on the actual technical details of the X420 a little more?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed for time right now.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
However, Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Mr.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ford, one final question.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?
