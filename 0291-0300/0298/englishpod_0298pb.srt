00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And for those of you who have been following, this is the very last episode of our 10-part series about giving a presentation in English.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is part 10, where we are going to receive questions from the audience.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this is called a Q&A session, or question and answer session.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll be back in a moment.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sincere thanks, Michael.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, I'm sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions, so I'd like to open up a Q&A session.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, Janice, go ahead.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, thank you, Jonathan.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I would just like to go back to the comment Mr.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Now, as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end laptop market.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How does Mr.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think you have hit the nail on the head, actually.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle, but don't forget who won that contest.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Mr.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ford, could you elaborate on actual technical details of the X420 a little more?

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed for time right now.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
However, Jonathan, is all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Um, Mr.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ford, one final question.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hahaha!

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright, we're back, so now let's take a look at some words on language takeaway.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Language takeaway.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, at the beginning of today's dialogue, Jonathan said, I'm sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What does this word, keen, mean?

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, so to be keen to do something, which basically means that you want to or would like to do something.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Right, are you keen?

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Would you like to do it?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you interested in doing it?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now, this is a very British form of addressing something, right?

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is very British, we don't really say this as much in America, but you can.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
People will understand you.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I would say, I'm sure many of you would like to ask some questions, and so you could say that both ways.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right, that's right.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, so many people want to ask questions, and Jonathan said, so I'd like to open it up to a Q&A session.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So these series of words here, to open it up to a Q&A session, what does that mean?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To open it up, it means the discussion.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So he would like to invite people to ask questions.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I'd like to open it up for questions means I would like to give you guys the opportunity to ask.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So to open up a discussion or to open up a conversation, right?

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I would like to open this up to you guys.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now one of the audience members asked about another company, which is their competitors, and said that they have a huge reputation and huge resources, this competitor.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So what is this word, reputation?

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Reputation is important.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A person can have a reputation, but a company can also have a reputation.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Now reputation means the way that other people talk about you.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So he has a good reputation means people say good things about him, or the media like newspapers and websites, they say good things about him.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But if you have a bad reputation, it means people are saying bad things about you.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So that pretty much sums it up, a reputation.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What other people say about you or how other people see you.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So maybe if a company like this has a huge reputation, it means that it's very well respected and people talk well about this company.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
All right.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now another question came along and they wanted to know a little bit more about the technical details of this product that they are introducing.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And Mr.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ford said that, you know what, right now we don't really have time, but I'm going to leave all the technical specs on this PowerPoint presentation and you can look at it later.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So specs, this is something you'll hear very, very often, especially in technical areas, but it means specifications for details.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So maybe I have a computer and it's, I know it's an IBM computer, but I don't know the specs.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't have the details.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So that's something that you would want to find out if you have a problem or you want to look into it more closely.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And so specs.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's right.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So these are the specs.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now, why don't we take a break?

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's take a look at our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Well, everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sincere thanks, Michael.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now I'm sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I'd like to open up a Q&A session.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all.

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, Janice, go ahead.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you, Jonathan.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I would just like to go back to the comment Mr.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now, as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end laptop market.

94
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How does Mr.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think you have hit the nail on the head, actually.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes, I admit, this is a David and Goliath battle, but don't forget who won that contest.

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Ford, could you elaborate on actual technical details of the X420 a little more?

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed for time right now.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
However, Jonathan, as all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Mr.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Ford, one final question.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
All right, we're back.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So now let's take a look at some of those phrases on Fluency Builder.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The first phrase we have here is one that I really like and I use very often.

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think you have hit the nail on the head.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right, to hit the nail on the head.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So this is a very common phrase, which basically means I think you got it exactly right.

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, so think about a nail that you're hammering something, you have a hammer in your hand.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's very easy to miss, but boom, when you hit it, hit the nail on the head, it means you have it exactly right.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So this was actually a response to one of the questions because it was a very good question and it had a valid point.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So this is why Mr.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ford said, you hit the nail on the head.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is exactly right.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I completely agree with you.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
After that, though, we had this interesting phrase.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He said, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay, so now this is obviously he's speaking metaphorically, right?

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's right.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So David and Goliath, that's actually a story that we often talk about.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a biblical story, so it comes from Christianity.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And David and Goliath fought, but David was very, very small and Goliath was a monster.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He was very big.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And so everyone said Goliath will win the fight.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But David won the fight.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And so this is an example or a story that people often use when they say, listen, it may be the case that you think the big giants will win, but actually the small man or our small company will win.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's right.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
As you said, we many times make reference to this, even not in the biblical sense, but it's just the size.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Maybe we're a small company, we're going to fight this big company.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So we say it's a David and Goliath battle or even athletes, maybe two boxers.

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
One is bigger than the other.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So they'll say it's a David and Goliath boxing match.

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Now, when we got the questions about the technical details of the computer, Mr.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ford said that we are a little bit pressed for time right now.

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's why we can't really answer that question.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's right.

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And so to be pressed for time means that you don't have a lot of time.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You are in a rush.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So if you are pressed for time, you don't have too much time.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't, you're in a hurry basically.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So I could say, Hey Marco, can you come here and look at this thing on my computer please?

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm a little bit pressed for time right now.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll take a look at it in an hour.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So those are all of our phrases from Fluency Builder.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's take another listen to our dialogue and we'll be right back.

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, everyone, I'm sure you'd like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Sincere thanks, Michael.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Now, I'm sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions, so I'd like to open up a Q&A session.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all.

161
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes, Janice, go ahead.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you, Jonathan.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I would just like to go back to the comment Mr.

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end laptop market.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How does Mr.

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, Janice, first of all, thanks for a very good question.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I think you have hit the nail on the head, actually.

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But although we can't compete in terms of size, I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes, I admit, this is a David and Goliath battle, but don't forget who won that contest.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Mr.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ford, could you elaborate on actual technical details of the X420 a little more?

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'd love to, but I think we're a little pressed for time right now.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
However, Jonathan, is all the technical specs for you on the PowerPoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mr.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ford, one final question.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right, so that was part 10 of our 10-part series about presentations.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We took a look at many different aspects where you can take it as an example, as we talked about computers and marketing, but you can more or less have an idea of how a presentation should go and the type of vocab you can use.

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's right, and I think that this particular dialogue today was very, very useful because a lot of times you're going to have people asking you questions and filling in details, and so you can use some of these phrases to help explain exactly what your presentation was about when people do have questions.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's right.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So we hope that you enjoyed this series, and we would like to hear from you if you have any other suggestions about a series of dialogues or a series of lessons that we can do.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We had one about a job interview, all the steps and everything, how a job interview would go.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We just had a series about presentations, so maybe you can give us some feedback or some ideas of what you would like to learn.

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let us know.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We'll see you there.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
All right, bye.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Bye.
