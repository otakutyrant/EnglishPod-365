2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,699
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

3
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:16,780
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,480
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,699
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,859
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,500
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,020
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

9
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:39,700
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,640
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,640
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,820
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice!

13
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,859
Um, sorry, I've lost my thread.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,259
What was I talking about again?

15
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,380
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,179
Yes, excuse me.

17
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,899
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, uh, let me see.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,939
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,659
No, sorry.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,340
IT is still fixing it.

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,700
Uh, okay, hmm.

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,019
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

24
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:17,040
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,420
Let me see, uh.

26
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,500
Mr.

27
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,799
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,420
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

29
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:28,120
That's a good question.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,280
Unfortunately, I, uh, don't have that information on me.

31
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,280
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

32
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,459
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

33
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,560
I think we're ready.

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:42,739
Thank goodness.

35
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,840
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,959
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

37
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,120
Enjoy!

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,819
Oh, uh, I'm terribly sorry.

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,420
This is not the advert.

40
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,540
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

41
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:01,200
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

42
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,560
Can we take five?

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,120
Come on, Mr.

44
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Ford!
