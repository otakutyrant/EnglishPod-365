EnglishPod.com.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice!

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Um, sorry, I've lost my thread.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What was I talking about again?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, excuse me.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, uh, let me see.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, sorry.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
IT is still fixing it.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Uh, okay, hmm.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let me see, uh.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mr.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's a good question.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Unfortunately, I, uh, don't have that information on me.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think we're ready.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Thank goodness.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Enjoy!

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, uh, I'm terribly sorry.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is not the advert.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can we take five?

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Come on, Mr.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ford!
