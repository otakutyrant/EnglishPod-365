00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,160
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:03,940
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,300
My name is Catherine, and we have another episode in our series all about giving presentations in English.

4
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:12,460
So this is show number eight for us.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:13,080
That's right.

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,960
We are getting towards the end of the series.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,899
On this occasion, presentation series number eight, we're going to continue with Mr.

8
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:25,160
Ford and try to handle a couple of problems that keep coming up.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:25,879
All right.

10
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,620
So let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss it.

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:45,359
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop, affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,020
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,219
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

14
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,340
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

15
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,020
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

16
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:04,519
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,219
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

18
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,159
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

19
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,159
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

20
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,359
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

21
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,379
Sorry, I've lost my thread.

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,799
What was I talking about again?

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,920
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

24
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,280
Yes, excuse me, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,500
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, uh, let me see, is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

26
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,019
No, sorry, IT is still fixing it.

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,560
Uh, okay, hmm, well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

28
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:48,079
I haven't actually got my notes with me, uh, let me see, uh.

29
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,019
Mr.

30
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,319
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,980
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,659
That's a good question.

33
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,819
Unfortunately, I, uh, don't have that information on me.

34
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,840
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

35
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

36
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,099
I think we're ready.

37
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,280
Thank goodness.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,379
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

39
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,520
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

40
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:19,659
Enjoy!

41
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,360
Oh, uh, I'm terribly sorry.

42
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,960
This is not the advert.

43
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,080
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

44
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,719
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,080
Can we take five?

46
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,659
Come on, Mr.

47
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,240
Ford!

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,180
Alright, we're back and Mr.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:43,460
Ford faced a very embarrassing moment here, um, but he also used a lot of interesting vocab.

50
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,120
Why don't we take a look at that now on Language Takeaway?

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,599
So, at the beginning of today's dialogue we heard a word that's very interesting, an anecdote.

52
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,020
What is an anecdote, Marco?

53
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:06,039
Right, he started telling a story and that's basically an anecdote, a life experience or a story, something that happened to you and you want to share with people.

54
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,400
Right, so an anecdote is a story.

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,620
Mm-hmm, so he was talking about golfing with a client and this is why, and so this is called an anecdote.

56
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,360
He was telling a story about it.

57
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,780
After that, though, we realized that he is a little bit distracted.

58
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,259
He says, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

59
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:33,460
That's right, so he's obviously talking about the computer and the marketing campaign and then he starts talking about golf and how great it is.

60
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:42,219
So he says, I got sidetracked and that means that you got distracted or you started talking about something that's not related to the topic.

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:50,080
So I really like to eat hamburgers and I like hamburgers with cheese, actually, but wait, sorry, just got a little sidetracked there.

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,139
I think we should focus on English right now.

63
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,840
That's right.

64
00:03:53,219 --> 00:04:01,500
So, it happens sometimes, maybe you're even, um, maybe you're even talking to someone and something is happening behind that person.

65
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,360
You get sidetracked and you're not really paying attention.

66
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,319
That's right.

67
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,639
And after that, we realized that there's still a problem with the projector and Mr.

68
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:17,660
Ford asks if it's working yet, Jonathan, his assistant says, no, sorry, IT are still fixing it.

69
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,259
All right, so this acronym, IT, I think many of you have heard it and it means for information technology.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,819
Okay, information technology that has to do with computers and so when we have a technical problem or a computer problem, we usually call IT.

71
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:32,800
That's right.

72
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:42,360
So your company probably has an IT department or if you have, as Catherine said, a problem with your computer, you just call IT to get them to fix it for you.

73
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:43,319
Exactly.

74
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:46,060
Another computer related word comes up later when Mr.

75
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,839
Ford says that all of the information about the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

76
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,100
That's right.

77
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,680
So PowerPoint, this is a computer program that is very well known for giving presentations.

78
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
So you probably use this if you ever have to give a presentation.

79
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:01,800
That's right.

80
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:07,800
And PowerPoint is a part of the Microsoft Office suite, so you know the program Word or the program Excel.

81
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:14,300
Well, so PowerPoint helps you use your computer to give a presentation, so you often hear us just talk about PowerPoint.

82
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,060
Can you help me with this PowerPoint in English?

83
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,920
That's right.

84
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:22,240
Okay, so that's all the words we have for you on language takeaway.

85
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:23,680
Why don't we listen to Mr.

86
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:26,680
Ford again and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

87
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:38,720
So, as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

88
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,800
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

89
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:47,500
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

90
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,759
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

91
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,839
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

92
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,500
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

93
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,100
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

94

95
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,639
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,680
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,839
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

98
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,860
Um, sorry, I've lost my thread.

99
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,279
What was I talking about again?

100
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,379
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,199
Yes, excuse me.

102
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,759
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

103
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,920
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, uh, let me see.

104
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,959
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,660
No, sorry.

106
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,379
IT is still fixing it.

107
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,759
Uh, okay, hmm.

108
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,019
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,040
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,459
Let me see, uh.

111
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,480
Mr.

112
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,800
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

113
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,420
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

114
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,139
That's a good question.

115
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,300
Unfortunately, I, uh, don't have that information on me.

116
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,680
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

117
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,459
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

118
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,579
I think we're ready.

119
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,740
Thank goodness.

120
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,839
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

121
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,980
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

122
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,139
Enjoy!

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,839
Oh, uh, I'm terribly sorry.

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,459
This is not the advert.

125
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,540
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

126
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,199
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

127
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,600
Can we take five?

128
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,139
Come on, Mr.

129
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:30,699
Ford!

130
00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:36,839
Alright, so we've picked out a lot of great phrases for you today.

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,199
Let's start with the first one on Fluency Builder.

132
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,899
At the very beginning, Mr.

133
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,699
Ford says we have pulled out all the stops to make a really great product.

134
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,660
That's right.

135
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,699
So the phrase used here, to pull out all the stops, what does that mean?

136
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,420
Well, you don't have to think about what it actually means.

137
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,839
We use this when we're trying to say that we've done our best.

138
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,939
We have really gone as far as we can, 100%.

139
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:08,279
We're giving everything we can to make this thing the best that it can be.

140
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,759
Okay, so you've put a lot of effort and resources into making something great.

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,459
You didn't hold back, you didn't save any money, you just went for it.

142
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,600
Okay, very good.

143
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,379
Now, when we were talking about Mr.

144
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:26,899
Ford being distracted and he started talking about golf, he said, oh, I'm sorry, I've lost my thread.

145
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,360
What was I talking about again?

146
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:36,539
Alright, so this is interesting because the word thread can mean something that you, it's like a string that you use to sew clothes with.

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:43,440
But in this particular case, we're talking about a thread of conversation, and so that's basically the topic that he's talking about.

148
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,559
Okay, so when he said, I lost my thread, he makes reference to the thread of conversation, of what he was talking about.

149
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,620
Right, so he's talking about golf, but he lost his thread, so then he doesn't remember what he was talking about.

150
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,919
Okay, very good.

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,759
And Mr.

152
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,100
Ford actually faced a couple of questions from the audience members.

153
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,460
One of them asked about the schedule for the campaign and he said, you know what, I really don't have that information.

154
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,779
I will have to get back to you on that point.

155
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:14,899
Well, this is a really great way to answer a question you don't actually know how to answer.

156
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,919
In this case, Mr.

157
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,519
Ford doesn't have the answer to this audience member's question like you said, Marco, so he just says, I will have to get back to you on that.

158
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,840
I will have to let you know later.

159
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,500
So it's much better to say I will get back to you instead of saying I don't know.

160
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,120
For example, if your boss asks you, I don't know, how were sales last year compared to this year?

161
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,440
And if you don't know, it's really not recommendable to say I don't know.

162
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,039
You don't want to say I don't know.

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,159
It makes you sound like you don't know anything.

164
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,740
And so in this case, you say, listen, I really have to get back to you about that.

165
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:54,440
I want to check some numbers or something.

166
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,080
Right, very good.

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:05,879
Okay, so moving on to our next phrase, when finally he was going to present the ad campaign, he said, so without further ado, the new 420 marketing campaign.

168
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:16,379
Alright, this phrase without further ado is something that we commonly hear in speeches or more formal occasions, but it's something that we say when we want to introduce something.

169
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,159
We say we're not going to talk about it anymore.

170
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,019
Let's just do it.

171
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:19,820
Let's just show you.

172
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
So the word ado is this.

173
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,440
This is, I think, like classic English.

174
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,419
It's not really common to hear it anymore.

175
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:31,580
No, there is actually a very famous play by Shakespeare called Much Ado about nothing.

176
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,399
And that means, you know, that there's a lot of talking and a lot of problems and a lot of drama about this one thing.

177
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,980
And so basically, when we say the phrase without further ado, we're saying, you know, without further talking, talking about this anymore.

178
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,279
Yeah.

179
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:46,740
Okay.

180
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:53,340
So it's a nice way to say, okay, finally, we're going to do this or finally we're going to see this.

181
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,320
And obviously, the video was not the campaign.

182
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,220
It was his golfing holiday in Barbados.

183
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,820
So he asked someone if he could take five.

184
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:06,279
Alright, this phrase to take five is very, very common in English.

185
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,399
And it's just another way to say, can we take a five minute break?

186
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:14,940
So maybe you can ask your teacher, excuse me, can we take five or something like that?

187
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:15,399
Yeah.

188
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,080
Or, hey, guys, I need a glass of water.

189
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,899
Let's take five.

190
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:19,379
Right.

191
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,700
So that means let's have a short break.

192
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,820
Let's take a five minute break.

193
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,899
But it doesn't always necessarily have to be five minutes.

194
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,179
No, it can be seven minutes or ten minutes, but take five means a short break.

195
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:30,220
Okay, very good.

196
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,039
So you don't say, can we take ten or can we take seven?

197
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,100
No, I usually just say take five.

198
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:35,600
Take five.

199
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:35,940
Okay.

200
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,179
Alright, so a lot of phrases there, a lot of great stuff.

201
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,080
Let's review it one last time.

202
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,879
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

203
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:56,919
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

204
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,620
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

205
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,860
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

206
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,940
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

207
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,620
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

208
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,220
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

209
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,820
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

210
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:21,759
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

211
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,779
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

212
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,960
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

213
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,000
Um, sorry, I've lost my thread.

214
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,399
What was I talking about again?

215
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,519
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

216
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,899
Yes, excuse me, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

217
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:43,059
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, let me see.

218
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,120
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

219
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,759
No, sorry.

220
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,600
IT is still fixing it.

221
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:49,960
Uh, okay.

222
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,159
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

223
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,179
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

224
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,860
Let me see.

225
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,600
Mr.

226
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,940
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

227
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,539
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

228
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,240
That's a good question.

229
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,419
Unfortunately, I don't have that information on me.

230
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,419
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

231
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,600
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

232
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,720
I think we're ready.

233
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,879
Thank goodness.

234
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,980
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

235
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,120
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

236
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,259
Enjoy!

237
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,980
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

238
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,580
This is not the advert.

239
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,700
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,340
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

241
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,700
Can we take five?

242
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:44,259
Come on, Mr.

243
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:44,840
Ford.

244
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,779
Okay, so we're coming towards the end of our presentation series.

245
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,399
So be sure to listen to us next week when we're talking about presentation series part nine.

246
00:13:55,659 --> 00:14:00,580
And as you may know, it ends with part ten, so then we'll start with a new series very, very soon.

247
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,779
And I don't know if you have any questions or any suggestions about a series, you can always contact us.

248
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,080
Yeah, please do let us know.

249
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,620
What are the things that you have a hard time with when you're studying English?

250
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,440
Are there things that are confusing or difficult?

251
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,779
We're happy to hear your suggestions and we hope that we can help out.

252
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,679
That's about it for us today, though, so until next time.
