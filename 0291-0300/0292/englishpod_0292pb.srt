00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and we have another episode in our series all about giving presentations in English.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So this is show number eight for us.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are getting towards the end of the series.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
On this occasion, presentation series number eight, we're going to continue with Mr.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Ford and try to handle a couple of problems that keep coming up.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All right.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let's take a listen to our dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss it.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop, affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sorry, I've lost my thread.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What was I talking about again?

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, excuse me, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, uh, let me see, is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, sorry, IT is still fixing it.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Uh, okay, hmm, well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I haven't actually got my notes with me, uh, let me see, uh.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Mr.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's a good question.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Unfortunately, I, uh, don't have that information on me.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think we're ready.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank goodness.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Enjoy!

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, uh, I'm terribly sorry.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is not the advert.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Can we take five?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on, Mr.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ford!

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Alright, we're back and Mr.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Ford faced a very embarrassing moment here, um, but he also used a lot of interesting vocab.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why don't we take a look at that now on Language Takeaway?

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, at the beginning of today's dialogue we heard a word that's very interesting, an anecdote.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is an anecdote, Marco?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Right, he started telling a story and that's basically an anecdote, a life experience or a story, something that happened to you and you want to share with people.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right, so an anecdote is a story.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Mm-hmm, so he was talking about golfing with a client and this is why, and so this is called an anecdote.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He was telling a story about it.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
After that, though, we realized that he is a little bit distracted.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He says, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right, so he's obviously talking about the computer and the marketing campaign and then he starts talking about golf and how great it is.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So he says, I got sidetracked and that means that you got distracted or you started talking about something that's not related to the topic.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I really like to eat hamburgers and I like hamburgers with cheese, actually, but wait, sorry, just got a little sidetracked there.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think we should focus on English right now.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's right.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So, it happens sometimes, maybe you're even, um, maybe you're even talking to someone and something is happening behind that person.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You get sidetracked and you're not really paying attention.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And after that, we realized that there's still a problem with the projector and Mr.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Ford asks if it's working yet, Jonathan, his assistant says, no, sorry, IT are still fixing it.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right, so this acronym, IT, I think many of you have heard it and it means for information technology.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, information technology that has to do with computers and so when we have a technical problem or a computer problem, we usually call IT.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's right.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So your company probably has an IT department or if you have, as Catherine said, a problem with your computer, you just call IT to get them to fix it for you.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Exactly.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Another computer related word comes up later when Mr.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ford says that all of the information about the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So PowerPoint, this is a computer program that is very well known for giving presentations.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So you probably use this if you ever have to give a presentation.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And PowerPoint is a part of the Microsoft Office suite, so you know the program Word or the program Excel.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Well, so PowerPoint helps you use your computer to give a presentation, so you often hear us just talk about PowerPoint.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can you help me with this PowerPoint in English?

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so that's all the words we have for you on language takeaway.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Why don't we listen to Mr.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ford again and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So, as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Um, sorry, I've lost my thread.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What was I talking about again?

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes, excuse me.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, uh, let me see.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, sorry.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
IT is still fixing it.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Uh, okay, hmm.

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let me see, uh.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's a good question.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Unfortunately, I, uh, don't have that information on me.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I think we're ready.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank goodness.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Enjoy!

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, uh, I'm terribly sorry.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This is not the advert.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Can we take five?

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Come on, Mr.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ford!

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Alright, so we've picked out a lot of great phrases for you today.

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's start with the first one on Fluency Builder.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
At the very beginning, Mr.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ford says we have pulled out all the stops to make a really great product.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So the phrase used here, to pull out all the stops, what does that mean?

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, you don't have to think about what it actually means.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We use this when we're trying to say that we've done our best.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We have really gone as far as we can, 100%.

139
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're giving everything we can to make this thing the best that it can be.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay, so you've put a lot of effort and resources into making something great.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You didn't hold back, you didn't save any money, you just went for it.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, very good.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Now, when we were talking about Mr.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ford being distracted and he started talking about golf, he said, oh, I'm sorry, I've lost my thread.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What was I talking about again?

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Alright, so this is interesting because the word thread can mean something that you, it's like a string that you use to sew clothes with.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But in this particular case, we're talking about a thread of conversation, and so that's basically the topic that he's talking about.

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, so when he said, I lost my thread, he makes reference to the thread of conversation, of what he was talking about.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Right, so he's talking about golf, but he lost his thread, so then he doesn't remember what he was talking about.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay, very good.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And Mr.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ford actually faced a couple of questions from the audience members.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
One of them asked about the schedule for the campaign and he said, you know what, I really don't have that information.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I will have to get back to you on that point.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, this is a really great way to answer a question you don't actually know how to answer.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In this case, Mr.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ford doesn't have the answer to this audience member's question like you said, Marco, so he just says, I will have to get back to you on that.

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will have to let you know later.

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So it's much better to say I will get back to you instead of saying I don't know.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
For example, if your boss asks you, I don't know, how were sales last year compared to this year?

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And if you don't know, it's really not recommendable to say I don't know.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't want to say I don't know.

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It makes you sound like you don't know anything.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And so in this case, you say, listen, I really have to get back to you about that.

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I want to check some numbers or something.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right, very good.

167
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay, so moving on to our next phrase, when finally he was going to present the ad campaign, he said, so without further ado, the new 420 marketing campaign.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Alright, this phrase without further ado is something that we commonly hear in speeches or more formal occasions, but it's something that we say when we want to introduce something.

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We say we're not going to talk about it anymore.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's just do it.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's just show you.

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So the word ado is this.

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is, I think, like classic English.

174
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not really common to hear it anymore.

175
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No, there is actually a very famous play by Shakespeare called Much Ado about nothing.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And that means, you know, that there's a lot of talking and a lot of problems and a lot of drama about this one thing.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And so basically, when we say the phrase without further ado, we're saying, you know, without further talking, talking about this anymore.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So it's a nice way to say, okay, finally, we're going to do this or finally we're going to see this.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And obviously, the video was not the campaign.

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It was his golfing holiday in Barbados.

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So he asked someone if he could take five.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Alright, this phrase to take five is very, very common in English.

185
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And it's just another way to say, can we take a five minute break?

186
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So maybe you can ask your teacher, excuse me, can we take five or something like that?

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Or, hey, guys, I need a glass of water.

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let's take five.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So that means let's have a short break.

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let's take a five minute break.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But it doesn't always necessarily have to be five minutes.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No, it can be seven minutes or ten minutes, but take five means a short break.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay, very good.

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So you don't say, can we take ten or can we take seven?

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, I usually just say take five.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Take five.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Alright, so a lot of phrases there, a lot of great stuff.

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's review it one last time.

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So as I mentioned previously, the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop.

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Affordability, quality, speed, and reliability.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Actually, just to illustrate my point, let me give you an anecdote here.

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers.

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It was a lovely summer afternoon.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf and wanted to get his input on the new X420.

209
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It really is a wonderful way to relax.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
To be honest, I'm not that great at golf, but I've improved in the last few years.

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice.

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Um, sorry, I've lost my thread.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What was I talking about again?

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement, Michael.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes, excuse me, I'm afraid I got sidetracked there.

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes, anyway, the campaign, well, let me see.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Is the projector working yet, Jonathan?

219
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No, sorry.

220
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
IT is still fixing it.

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Uh, okay.

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Well, all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I haven't actually got my notes with me.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let me see.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mr.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign?

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
When were the first advertisements scheduled for?

228
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's a good question.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Unfortunately, I don't have that information on me.

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll have to get back to you on that point.

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Okay, Michael, the projector is fixed.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I think we're ready.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank goodness.

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay, everyone, sorry for the delay.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So, without further ado, the new X420 marketing campaign.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Enjoy!

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is not the advert.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This is my golfing holiday in Barbados.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think I must have brought the wrong file.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Can we take five?

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come on, Mr.

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Ford.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Okay, so we're coming towards the end of our presentation series.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So be sure to listen to us next week when we're talking about presentation series part nine.

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And as you may know, it ends with part ten, so then we'll start with a new series very, very soon.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And I don't know if you have any questions or any suggestions about a series, you can always contact us.

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, please do let us know.

249
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What are the things that you have a hard time with when you're studying English?

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Are there things that are confusing or difficult?

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We're happy to hear your suggestions and we hope that we can help out.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's about it for us today, though, so until next time.
