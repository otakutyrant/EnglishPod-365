00:00:01,499 --> 00:00:07,879
EnglishPod.com Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,820
Oh, I can't.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,679
I have a date.

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:11,740
Really?

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,560
Wow, with who?

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,859
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,640
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,699
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,500
You mean you met her online?

10
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:24,719
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:28,239
I signed up for a website called Match.com and it's great.

12
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,060
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,159
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,000
That's kind of weird.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,000
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

16
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,899
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

17
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,539
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

18
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:52,979
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

19
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,359
I guess it does seem logical.

20
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,840
I'll have to check it out.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,719
Thanks for watching!
