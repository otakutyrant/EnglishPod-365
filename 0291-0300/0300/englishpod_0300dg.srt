00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, I can't.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I have a date.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Really?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Wow, with who?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You mean you met her online?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I signed up for a website called Match.com and it's great.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's kind of weird.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I guess it does seem logical.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll have to check it out.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thanks for watching!
