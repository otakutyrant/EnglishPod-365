00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,980
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,660
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:09,580
My name is Catherine, and this is our 300th lesson here at EnglishPod, so it's a special lesson.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,160
But today we're talking a little bit about dating.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,140
That's right.

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we're going to talk about dating now in a little bit of a less conventional way, a new type of dating, very modern with using technology.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,579
Using technology, that's right.

8
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,059
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,719
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

10
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:36,679
Oh, I can't.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,560
I have a date.

12
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:38,579
Really?

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,380
Wow, with who?

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,700
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,460
She's really cool, and she's driving over here this weekend.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,539
Wait a minute.

17
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:50,320
You mean you met her online?

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,520
Yeah.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,640
Yeah.

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,060
I signed up for a website called Match.com, and it's great.

21
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,899
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

22
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,000
Then you find people that have similar characteristics, and you can email them or chat.

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,819
That's kind of weird.

24
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:09,819
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,760
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,379
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,799
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

28
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,200
I guess it does seem logical.

29
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,200
I'll have to check it out.

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,760
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,420
So now let's take a look at some of these keywords that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,079
So the first word is a word that you're going to hear English speakers say all the time, especially if they're Americans.

34
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,560
So cool is our first word.

35
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:47,000
Right.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,640
This guy described this girl that he is seeing as really cool.

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,659
She's really cool.

38
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,319
So what does that mean if I describe someone as a cool person?

39
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,019
A cool person is someone who you like.

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,900
It's a good thing.

41
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:07,040
So someone who is cool, I think of as relaxed and interesting and someone who maybe had lots of ideas or things to say.

42
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,620
Okay.

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,639
So if you say that a person is cool, you're saying that you like that person.

44
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,539
Now, what if you say something is cool, like Paris is really cool?

45
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,780
Paris is cool.

46
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,800
It's a cool city.

47
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,539
That means it's an interesting city.

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,060
It's something that you like.

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,259
Maybe you're trying to recommend someone to go there.

50
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,759
You can also say that movie was really cool.

51
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,840
So again, it means you liked it.

52
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,060
Okay.

53
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,439
So talking about dating, this friend was a bit surprised when he said that he met this girl online.

54
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:38,639
That's right.

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,780
So online, where is this place online?

56
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,800
It's in cyberspace.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,560
All right.

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,680
So online means on the internet, and we often use this when describing things.

59
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,740
So EnglishPod is an online English learning site.

60
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,379
That's right.

61
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,080
So anything that is in the internet, in cyberspace, you say that is online.

62
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,639
So our website is online, or maybe you have pictures online.

63
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,400
I have many photographs online, or I like to meet people online.

64
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:07,099
Okay.

65
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:13,759
So continuing on, we talked about a website that obviously that's online where you find people.

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:20,259
And talking about preferences, you mentioned that you can state whether you are a smoker or if you have pets.

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,560
So what is a person that's a smoker?

68
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,319
Well, many of you have probably heard the term to smoke before.

69
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,379
I smoke cigarettes.

70
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:28,960
I smoke.

71
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,659
But a smoker is a person who smokes cigarettes.

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,800
And so I could say that I want a non-smoker if I'm looking for a boyfriend because I don't want someone who smokes.

73
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,500
But maybe if you do smoke, you can say, I'm looking for a smoker, someone who does smoke.

74
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,159
So his friend was a little bit concerned, saying, well, that's weird.

75
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,500
What if this girl is a psycho or something like that?

76
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:52,620
All right.

77
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,479
A psycho.

78
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,719
Now, maybe you've heard of the movie Psycho.

79
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,620
But psycho is something that we use in English to say that someone is really crazy, almost scary crazy.

80
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,800
It comes from the word psychopath, right?

81
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,599
That's right.

82
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,740
And a psychopath is someone who is crazy but also very dangerous.

83
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,199
Right.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,099
So obviously, when we use this word, we're describing someone as being a little bit strange or maybe even a little bit dangerous.

85
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:15,819
That's right.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,579
So we don't want any psychos to come and talk to us online, right?

87
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:21,379
That's right.

88
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:31,379
So he went on to explain how dating is just the same online as it is offline and that he thinks it's a really cool alternative, even if you're shy.

89
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:41,180
So something is an alternative if you have different options, maybe dating by going to a bar and meeting someone is what normal people do.

90
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,920
But an alternative to that would be dating online.

91
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:45,560
That's right.

92
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,019
That means it's another option.

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,959
So the word alternative is a second option.

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,899
Another option.

95
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:51,519
Right.

96
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,459
For example, if I want to go have Italian food tonight but you don't want to, I'd say, hey Marco, well, can you give me an alternative idea?

97
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,560
That is the other option.

98
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:00,839
All right.

99
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,060
Great.

100
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,459
So a lot of words in this very interesting dialogue.

101
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,339
Stay with us.

102
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,120
We'll be right back where we'll take a look at Fluency Builder.

103
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,060
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, I can't.

105
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:17,879
I have a date.

106
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,920
Really?

107
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,980
Wow.

108
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:20,699
With who?

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,040
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

110
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,800
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

111
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,860
Wait a minute.

112
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,660
You mean you met her online?

113
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:31,879
Yeah.

114
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,399
I signed up for a website called match.com and it's great.

115
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,199
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

116
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:45,319
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

117
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:47,160
That's kind of weird.

118
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,160
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

119
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,060
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

120
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

121
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,120
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

122
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,519
I guess it does seem logical.

123
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll have to check it out.

124
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:10,839
All right, we're back and we've picked out five key phrases for you.

125
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,680
Let's check those out on Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,259
Fluency Builder.

127
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,040
All right, the first phrase we've got here is one that we often use in English, spoken English, to talk about seeing our friends.

128
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,600
Okay, so the first person says, do you want to hang out tomorrow?

129
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,379
To hang out.

130
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:27,980
That's right.

131
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,079
So let's hang out.

132
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,399
We never hang out anymore.

133
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,139
What does that mean?

134
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,699
Well, to hang out is, it's hard to define because you can do many things when you're hanging out.

135
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,480
But basically it means friends being together.

136
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:46,220
So watching a movie, listening to music, chatting, these are all examples of hanging out.

137
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,459
So maybe if you get together with your friend, just sit in the living room and talk, you're hanging out.

138
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,100
That's right.

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,439
Or you could go drive a car together and you're hanging out, you're talking.

140
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,439
So to hang out is to be social, is to talk to your friends.

141
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,680
To spend time together.

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,040
And he said, wait, oh, I can't because I have a date.

143
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,319
Okay, to have a date.

144
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,639
So a date is a romantic appointment with someone that you want to go out with, but you have a date.

145
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,620
This is something you have.

146
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,839
I have a date that night.

147
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,879
So this is actually a very important part because as you said, it's a romantic appointment.

148
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:27,620
So if you have to go to the doctor and he's not your boyfriend or anything like this, you don't say, I have a date with the doctor.

149
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,220
No, you say, I have an appointment with the doctor.

150
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,040
But if it's romantic, you say, ooh, I want to get my hair done because I have a date tonight.

151
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,699
Right.

152
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,560
I have a date.

153
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,939
I want to look nice for my date.

154
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:39,720
Okay.

155
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,120
And then he goes on to explain that this date that he has is with a girl that he has been chatting with.

156
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:46,579
Okay.

157
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,139
So the verb here is to chat with, chat.

158
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,439
Chat just means to talk to talk to, but in internet terms, to chat with means to talk to on the internet.

159
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:03,959
So maybe you use a program like MSN or Google G chat to talk to somebody online.

160
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,180
That's called chatting.

161
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,100
That's right.

162
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:15,060
So I think everyone has done this at one point or another when you are online chatting via MSN messenger or any of these chat clients.

163
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:21,319
So very, very common thing, but remember to add the chat with, I am chatting with my friends.

164
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:21,920
Yeah.

165
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,660
I don't like to chat with people while I'm at work on the internet.

166
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,759
Now this guy explained about the website, match.com, and he said that he signed up for this website.

167
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,240
Okay.

168
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,600
Another really key verb when you're talking about internet things.

169
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,980
So for example, if you want to come to EnglishPod, you can sign up for a free trial.

170
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
That means provide your information, right?

171
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,820
Start to use.

172
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:48,539
That's right.

173
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,700
So it applies for things online and offline.

174
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:57,519
For example, in the real world or offline, you can sign up for a cooking class.

175
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,200
That's right.

176
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:02,120
Or last week I signed up for a dance class so I can learn how to dance.

177
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:02,899
Very good.

178
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,500
Okay.

179
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:12,179
And then to finish off, the guy explained that he's tired of meeting people at bars or that his friends set up dates for him.

180
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:13,500
Okay.

181
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,759
So he doesn't like to be set up.

182
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:22,039
To be set up, remember that B, to be set up, that means someone else is doing this to you.

183
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,399
So Marco, I want to set you up with my friend.

184
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,299
That means I want to take you and my friend and make you have a date.

185
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,580
Right, exactly.

186
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,480
So this is exactly what it means.

187
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:38,480
To set someone up or to be set up is to have them go on a date with someone else.

188
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,019
All right.

189
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:45,500
So I don't like to be set up because I like to know the person I will have a date with before we go out.

190
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,039
But when you're set up, someone else makes the decision for you.

191
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,340
That's right.

192
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,440
So it's a little bit difficult.

193
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,159
That's right.

194
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,539
So a lot of interesting things here.

196
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,940
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue one last time and we'll be right back.

197
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,539
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

198
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,559
Oh, I can't.

199
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,379
I have a date.

200
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,440
Really?

201
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:09,460
Wow.

202
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,179
With who?

203
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,519
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

204
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,320
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

205
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,360
Wait a minute.

206
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
You mean you met her online?

207
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,360
Yeah.

208
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,899
I signed up for a website called Match.com and it's great.

209
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:30,700
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

210
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,840
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

211
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:36,679
That's kind of weird.

212
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,659
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

213
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:42,580
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

214
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,159
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

215
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,639
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,039
I guess it does seem logical.

217
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:53,620
I'll have to check it out.

218
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:56,919
All right.

219
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:03,899
So talking about setting up, this is another word that comes to mind when your friends set you up for a date is a blind date.

220
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:04,740
Okay.

221
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,039
So a blind date is not a date with two blind people.

222
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:08,460
Right.

223
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:14,779
A blind date is a date that you go to when you don't know who the other person is before you go.

224
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:15,419
That's right.

225
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:20,779
So for example, my friend's mother loves to set people up on blind dates.

226
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,919
She's a match maker.

227
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,620
She makes couples.

228
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
And so she will call one person and call the other person and then she'll make them have a date.

229
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,279
She sets them up and then they have this date, a blind date.

230
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,220
A blind date.

231
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,720
That's right.

232
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:47,100
And actually what you're doing with this technology now that you can use a website to find and meet people who are also looking for romance, it's very interesting.

233
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,539
It's very modern, obviously, because now we have the technology to do it.

234
00:11:50,840 --> 00:12:00,220
And many people actually have very successful or very great love stories of how they met online, chatting or while playing a video game online or many different things like this.

235
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,940
Well, the thing that I like about it, and I have to say I've never done it.

236
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:11,519
So what I like from hearing about it is that like Match.com, you save a lot of time.

237
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:12,759
It seems that way.

238
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,679
Because you get to tell the person, hey, I don't like people who smoke.

239
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,279
I don't like people who have pets, but I really like people who play video games.

240
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,940
And so you find people who are like that and then you can, you know, get to know that person better.

241
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,100
But I think it's hard when you're going on dates, especially, you know, your friends, they set you up and you have nothing in common.

242
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,700
You have no interests that are in common and that can be really frustrating.

243
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:51,059
So it seems like online dating is a new type of efficient way of dating because you preliminary already filter out everyone or everything that you don't like about a person and you find someone that has your same or similar likes.

244
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,419
So it.

245
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,519
But that's that's modern day, right?

246
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,279
That's right.

247
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,379
A lot of people I know have dated using these websites and have been very successful.

248
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,399
They've been married.

249
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:01,159
Yeah.

250
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:01,940
Wow.

251
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,519
It's amazing.

252
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,279
So actually, this is a great thing.

253
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:12,259
Let us know if you have any friend who has found their significant other husband or wife via online dating or if you've tried it.

254
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,700
Maybe you can let us know how it is.

255
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,899
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,980
Don't forget to sign up if you don't have an account.

257
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,960
And we'll see you there.

258
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,340
All right.

259
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:19,740
Bye, guys.

260
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,059
Bye.
