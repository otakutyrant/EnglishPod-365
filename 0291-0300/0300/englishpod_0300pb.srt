00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and this is our 300th lesson here at EnglishPod, so it's a special lesson.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But today we're talking a little bit about dating.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we're going to talk about dating now in a little bit of a less conventional way, a new type of dating, very modern with using technology.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Using technology, that's right.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, I can't.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have a date.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Really?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Wow, with who?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
She's really cool, and she's driving over here this weekend.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait a minute.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You mean you met her online?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I signed up for a website called Match.com, and it's great.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then you find people that have similar characteristics, and you can email them or chat.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's kind of weird.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I guess it does seem logical.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll have to check it out.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So now let's take a look at some of these keywords that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So the first word is a word that you're going to hear English speakers say all the time, especially if they're Americans.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So cool is our first word.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Right.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This guy described this girl that he is seeing as really cool.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She's really cool.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So what does that mean if I describe someone as a cool person?

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A cool person is someone who you like.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a good thing.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So someone who is cool, I think of as relaxed and interesting and someone who maybe had lots of ideas or things to say.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So if you say that a person is cool, you're saying that you like that person.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now, what if you say something is cool, like Paris is really cool?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Paris is cool.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a cool city.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That means it's an interesting city.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's something that you like.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Maybe you're trying to recommend someone to go there.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can also say that movie was really cool.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So again, it means you liked it.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So talking about dating, this friend was a bit surprised when he said that he met this girl online.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's right.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So online, where is this place online?

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's in cyberspace.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So online means on the internet, and we often use this when describing things.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So EnglishPod is an online English learning site.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So anything that is in the internet, in cyberspace, you say that is online.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So our website is online, or maybe you have pictures online.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have many photographs online, or I like to meet people online.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So continuing on, we talked about a website that obviously that's online where you find people.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
And talking about preferences, you mentioned that you can state whether you are a smoker or if you have pets.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So what is a person that's a smoker?

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, many of you have probably heard the term to smoke before.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I smoke cigarettes.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I smoke.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But a smoker is a person who smokes cigarettes.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And so I could say that I want a non-smoker if I'm looking for a boyfriend because I don't want someone who smokes.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But maybe if you do smoke, you can say, I'm looking for a smoker, someone who does smoke.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So his friend was a little bit concerned, saying, well, that's weird.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What if this girl is a psycho or something like that?

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
All right.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A psycho.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Now, maybe you've heard of the movie Psycho.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But psycho is something that we use in English to say that someone is really crazy, almost scary crazy.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It comes from the word psychopath, right?

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And a psychopath is someone who is crazy but also very dangerous.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Right.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So obviously, when we use this word, we're describing someone as being a little bit strange or maybe even a little bit dangerous.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So we don't want any psychos to come and talk to us online, right?

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So he went on to explain how dating is just the same online as it is offline and that he thinks it's a really cool alternative, even if you're shy.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So something is an alternative if you have different options, maybe dating by going to a bar and meeting someone is what normal people do.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But an alternative to that would be dating online.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's right.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That means it's another option.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So the word alternative is a second option.

94
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Another option.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
For example, if I want to go have Italian food tonight but you don't want to, I'd say, hey Marco, well, can you give me an alternative idea?

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That is the other option.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Great.

100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So a lot of words in this very interesting dialogue.

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Stay with us.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We'll be right back where we'll take a look at Fluency Builder.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, I can't.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have a date.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Really?

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Wow.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
With who?

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wait a minute.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You mean you met her online?

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I signed up for a website called match.com and it's great.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's kind of weird.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I guess it does seem logical.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll have to check it out.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right, we're back and we've picked out five key phrases for you.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's check those out on Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Fluency Builder.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,000
All right, the first phrase we've got here is one that we often use in English, spoken English, to talk about seeing our friends.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, so the first person says, do you want to hang out tomorrow?

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
To hang out.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's right.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So let's hang out.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We never hang out anymore.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What does that mean?

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, to hang out is, it's hard to define because you can do many things when you're hanging out.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But basically it means friends being together.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So watching a movie, listening to music, chatting, these are all examples of hanging out.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So maybe if you get together with your friend, just sit in the living room and talk, you're hanging out.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's right.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or you could go drive a car together and you're hanging out, you're talking.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So to hang out is to be social, is to talk to your friends.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
To spend time together.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And he said, wait, oh, I can't because I have a date.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay, to have a date.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So a date is a romantic appointment with someone that you want to go out with, but you have a date.

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is something you have.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have a date that night.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So this is actually a very important part because as you said, it's a romantic appointment.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So if you have to go to the doctor and he's not your boyfriend or anything like this, you don't say, I have a date with the doctor.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, you say, I have an appointment with the doctor.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But if it's romantic, you say, ooh, I want to get my hair done because I have a date tonight.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Right.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I have a date.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I want to look nice for my date.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And then he goes on to explain that this date that he has is with a girl that he has been chatting with.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So the verb here is to chat with, chat.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Chat just means to talk to talk to, but in internet terms, to chat with means to talk to on the internet.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So maybe you use a program like MSN or Google G chat to talk to somebody online.

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's called chatting.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So I think everyone has done this at one point or another when you are online chatting via MSN messenger or any of these chat clients.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So very, very common thing, but remember to add the chat with, I am chatting with my friends.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't like to chat with people while I'm at work on the internet.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Now this guy explained about the website, match.com, and he said that he signed up for this website.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Another really key verb when you're talking about internet things.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So for example, if you want to come to EnglishPod, you can sign up for a free trial.

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That means provide your information, right?

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Start to use.

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So it applies for things online and offline.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
For example, in the real world or offline, you can sign up for a cooking class.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Or last week I signed up for a dance class so I can learn how to dance.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Very good.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then to finish off, the guy explained that he's tired of meeting people at bars or that his friends set up dates for him.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So he doesn't like to be set up.

182
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
To be set up, remember that B, to be set up, that means someone else is doing this to you.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So Marco, I want to set you up with my friend.

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That means I want to take you and my friend and make you have a date.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Right, exactly.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So this is exactly what it means.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
To set someone up or to be set up is to have them go on a date with someone else.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
All right.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So I don't like to be set up because I like to know the person I will have a date with before we go out.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But when you're set up, someone else makes the decision for you.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's right.

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So it's a little bit difficult.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's right.

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Okay.

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So a lot of interesting things here.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why don't we take a look at our dialogue one last time and we'll be right back.

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Do you want to hang out tomorrow?

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, I can't.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have a date.

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Wow.

202
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
With who?

203
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend.

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait a minute.

206
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You mean you met her online?

207
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I signed up for a website called Match.com and it's great.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.

211
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's kind of weird.

212
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What if she's a psycho or something like that?

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I guess it does seem logical.

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll have to check it out.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
All right.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So talking about setting up, this is another word that comes to mind when your friends set you up for a date is a blind date.

220
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So a blind date is not a date with two blind people.

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Right.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A blind date is a date that you go to when you don't know who the other person is before you go.

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's right.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So for example, my friend's mother loves to set people up on blind dates.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
She's a match maker.

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
She makes couples.

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And so she will call one person and call the other person and then she'll make them have a date.

229
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
She sets them up and then they have this date, a blind date.

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A blind date.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's right.

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And actually what you're doing with this technology now that you can use a website to find and meet people who are also looking for romance, it's very interesting.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's very modern, obviously, because now we have the technology to do it.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And many people actually have very successful or very great love stories of how they met online, chatting or while playing a video game online or many different things like this.

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, the thing that I like about it, and I have to say I've never done it.

236
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So what I like from hearing about it is that like Match.com, you save a lot of time.

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It seems that way.

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Because you get to tell the person, hey, I don't like people who smoke.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't like people who have pets, but I really like people who play video games.

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And so you find people who are like that and then you can, you know, get to know that person better.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But I think it's hard when you're going on dates, especially, you know, your friends, they set you up and you have nothing in common.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have no interests that are in common and that can be really frustrating.

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So it seems like online dating is a new type of efficient way of dating because you preliminary already filter out everyone or everything that you don't like about a person and you find someone that has your same or similar likes.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So it.

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But that's that's modern day, right?

246
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's right.

247
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
A lot of people I know have dated using these websites and have been very successful.

248
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They've been married.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yeah.

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wow.

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's amazing.

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So actually, this is a great thing.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Let us know if you have any friend who has found their significant other husband or wife via online dating or if you've tried it.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Maybe you can let us know how it is.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't forget to sign up if you don't have an account.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And we'll see you there.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
All right.

259
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Bye, guys.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Bye.
