00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another podcast with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we're going to be looking at a very popular topic, something that everyone has to do at least once in their life.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right, we're talking about mobile phones and getting a mobile phone plan.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right, so you have a mobile phone, you need to get a plan or you need to do something in order to make it work, right?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, and in this lesson we're going to learn some language to help you do that.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Alright, so let's start with the language on vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the dialogue we're going to compare two types of mobile phone plans, the prepaid plan and the monthly rate plan.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, so we have two types of plans.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Prepaid.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Prepaid plan.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, a prepaid plan.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, a prepaid plan basically, just like the name suggests, you pay before you use the minutes.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So maybe you have to buy a card and then you can use maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 100 minutes.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Exactly.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then when you run out of money or you use all your minutes, you can buy another card and like that.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yep, but the monthly rate plan is different.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So the monthly rate plan you have to pay each month.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Right, at the end of each month.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
At the end of each month.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And what do you pay?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You pay for everything you used.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You get a bill at the end of the month.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Exactly.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so very interesting, these are the ways that mobile phone plans usually work and well, now it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the first time.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We are going to be listening as a shopper is looking to buy maybe a mobile phone or get a mobile phone plan.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I see.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, can I look at your phone?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What?

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Really?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, you're in luck.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You see, if you sign up for our three year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Really?

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's the catch?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's no catch.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You just choose a plan, sign a three year contract and that's it.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And we're giving away a BlackBerry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So what does this plan include?

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tell mobile clients.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wow.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All this for $40 per month.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Plus the activation fee and the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, and any charges for extra minutes and...

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, it sounds like a lot more than $40, doesn't it?

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is very common.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
They always say that it's a very low price and they always have these hidden charges, right?

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So why don't we look at some of the language they were using in the dialogue now in Language Takeaway.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alright, on Language Takeaway today, we're going to be looking at four very basic words that are used in this whole mobile phone context.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And the first one is activate.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
To activate my cell phone.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Alright, so you have to activate your cell phone.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You have to make the cell phone work.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So basically you make it work.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now, can you only apply this to mobile phones?

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No, there's many things that you must activate to make work.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For example, you must activate your computer software.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, or maybe you have to activate your credit card.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Or activate your bank account.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So usually you do this for the first time before you start using it.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah, like imagine your mobile phone is sleeping, right?

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And you need to activate it to make it start working.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But you only do it once.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right, only once.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, we talk about mobile phone or we say the cell phone, but this also has a specific name, right?

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right, a handset.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Handset.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A handset.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And call it a handset.

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Exactly.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Alright, a very easy word, but it's kind of a little bit more technical.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Now, one of the things they were talking about with this monthly rate plan was a rollover option.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Rollover.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
A rollover option.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So what is this rollover option about?

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, okay, I'll give you an example.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's say you have 500 minutes each month.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And you only use 4 of them in this month.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
100 of those minutes can rollover, can move over to the next month.

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So now you have 600 minutes.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So basically the minutes that you don't use, you can still use the following month.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, so that's a rollover plan.

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now we might recognize the verb to rollover, right?

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Right, so it's very similar to physically move from one place to another.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yep.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Alright, rollover.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And now in the end we talked about many types of fees.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's right, activation fee.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, or we also had emergency services fee.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So what is a fee?

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A fee is the amount of money you must pay for a service.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay, so this is important, it's for a service.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yep, you can't pay a fee for something you can touch.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, so if I go to the store, I don't say, what is the fee for filling this bottle of water?

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, so for a service.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, for an action.

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Alright, very good.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We're going to slow it down because it was a little bit fast.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Hi there, can I help you?

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, I've just moved here.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And I'd like to if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I see.

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's not compatible with our 3g network.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Really?

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, you're plan will throw in a handset for free.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Really?

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's the catch?

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There's no catch.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You just choose a plan, sign a three year contract, and that's it.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And we're giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So what does this plan include?

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes, and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tell mobile clients 1000 text messages per month, and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wow.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All this for $40 per month.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Plus the activation fee, the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, and any charges for extra minutes and Well, you know, there's some interesting phrases in this dialogue.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And you know, a lot of them can be used when you're talking about a negotiation or a contract or a deal.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
All right, great.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So let's take a look at these phrases in fluency builder.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Fluency builder.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Okay, the first phrase that we have on fluency builder today was the problem that she had with her mobile phone was that it wasn't compatible with a 3g network.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, to be compatible with to be compatible with to be compatible with now this word compatible means that it works well with something else.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Exactly.

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now, there's a lot of things that you can use this phrase compatible with together with, you know, people things.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So why don't we hear a few examples now.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Example one.

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Our application is compatible with most smartphones.

153
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Example two.

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
My roommate and I are just not compatible.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
All she ever does is study.

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
And I like to stay up late and party.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Example three.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry, your computer is not compatible with our software.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's too old.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, great example.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So compatible with very clear and it's very useful.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's right.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now, what about the next phrase?

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, you know, the girl was hearing about all of these great things that are included in the contract and she asked, what's the catch?

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's the catch?

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's the catch?

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So she was asking for the catch.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What is the catch?

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, good thing you asked.

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A catch is something negative, something that's hidden, that makes the deal seem not so great.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, so if somebody offers me a new car, they say you can have this new for free.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Okay, well, that seems too good to be true.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So what is the catch?

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The catch is that I can only drive it at night.

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, that's kind of annoying.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Right, so that's the catch.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There's like a condition.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now, she asked about the catch and she said, well, there's no catch, you know, you just signed the contract.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And then the salesman told the lady that she is in luck.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're in luck.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
To be in luck.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, okay, I think we can really understand the meaning, right?

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When you're in luck, something lucky has happened.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Right, you're having good fortune.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But how do we use it?

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So maybe you're looking for a very special bottle of wine for dinner tonight.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yep, it's very rare.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay, and you go into this little store and all of a sudden you're in luck.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You found it there.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Exactly.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This phrase is actually most commonly used in the second person.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're in luck.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You are in luck.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You are in luck tonight.

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, and usually when someone asks you for something, then you say, you're in luck.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're in luck, I have it.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Or, you're in luck, I have the very last one.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Exactly.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Alright, and now to end Affluency Builder, we have one more phrase and so it was when the salesman said, we'll throw in a handset for free.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Alright, to throw something in.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So if she signs the contract, he will throw in a free handset.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It means to include something for free.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, so you can say, if you buy this house, I'll throw in the dog.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The dog for free, right?

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So to throw in, to include for free.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Right.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Okay, alright, so great phrases and I think we understand them now, so let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone and I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I see.

211
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Unfortunately this phone can't be used in the U.S.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What?

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Really?

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, you're in luck.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You see, if you sign up for our 3 year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What's the catch?

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's no catch.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You just choose a plan, sign a 3 year contract and that's it.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now and we're giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

224
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So, what does this plan include?

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tell mobile clients.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Wow.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
All this for $40 per month?

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's right.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Plus the activation fee and the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, and any charges for extra minutes and mobile phones.

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is very common in the United States, right?

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
These monthly plans.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Most places where I have lived, it's much more common to pay as you go, right?

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
To have a prepaid plan.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But in the States, almost everyone goes with the monthly plan.

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Maybe it's because in order to have a monthly plan, you need to have a credit card.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You might be on to something.

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Right?

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, if you don't have a credit card or maybe you're 18, you can't get a monthly plan.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, you gotta do this prepaid plan.

244
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You know, another interesting thing that I've noticed when living in different countries and seeing mobile phone habits, Americans and North Americans respond very differently to a ringing mobile phone than other people do.

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How so?

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For example, if I was in a meeting in America and my phone rang and I answered it, people might think that I was very rude to answer the phone in a meeting.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But you know, here when we're living in China, it's totally normal.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's, you know, everyone does it.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's the polite thing to do.

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Answer your phone.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Right.

253
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I think that's absolutely true.

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And maybe it's because in North America, you have this voicemail option for your mobile phone.

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah.

256
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And everyone has it.

257
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Everyone has it.

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So, if it's something very important, then the person will leave you a voicemail message and then you will know what it's about or you can call them back.

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But here, I guess, or in other countries, maybe they don't have that option.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So, they need to answer every call.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's interesting.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
An interesting sort of cultural difference in the way we use our phones.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But what about listeners?

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
In your country, do you answer the phone immediately or do you let it ring?

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Right.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Or maybe do you see who's calling and maybe just not answer it.

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yeah.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I screen your calls.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I screen a call.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
