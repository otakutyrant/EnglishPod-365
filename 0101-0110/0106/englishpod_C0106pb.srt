00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:06,700
Welcome back to another podcast with us here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,419
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,599
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,059
And today we're going to be looking at a very popular topic, something that everyone has to do at least once in their life.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,260
That's right, we're talking about mobile phones and getting a mobile phone plan.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,480
Right, so you have a mobile phone, you need to get a plan or you need to do something in order to make it work, right?

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,719
Yes, and in this lesson we're going to learn some language to help you do that.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,039
Alright, so let's start with the language on vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,460
Vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:48,960
In the dialogue we're going to compare two types of mobile phone plans, the prepaid plan and the monthly rate plan.

12
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,479
Okay, so we have two types of plans.

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:52,479
Prepaid.

14
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,640
Prepaid plan.

15
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,560
Okay, a prepaid plan.

16
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:04,420
Well, a prepaid plan basically, just like the name suggests, you pay before you use the minutes.

17
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,819
So maybe you have to buy a card and then you can use maybe 20 minutes or 30 minutes or 100 minutes.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:10,560
Exactly.

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,159
And then when you run out of money or you use all your minutes, you can buy another card and like that.

20
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,920
Yep, but the monthly rate plan is different.

21
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,280
So the monthly rate plan you have to pay each month.

22
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:25,780
Right, at the end of each month.

23
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,859
At the end of each month.

24
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,680
And what do you pay?

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,120
You pay for everything you used.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,040
You get a bill at the end of the month.

27
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:32,519
Exactly.

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Okay, so very interesting, these are the ways that mobile phone plans usually work and well, now it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the first time.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,780
We are going to be listening as a shopper is looking to buy maybe a mobile phone or get a mobile phone plan.

30
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:59,319
Yeah, I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone.

31
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,599
And I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

32
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:04,780
I see.

33
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,500
Well, can I look at your phone?

34
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,780
Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

35
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,819
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:12,780
What?

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,699
Really?

38
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:16,879
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

39
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:17,740
Well, you're in luck.

40
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,139
You see, if you sign up for our three year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

41
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:21,900
Really?

42
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:23,039
What's the catch?

43
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,819
There's no catch.

44
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,860
You just choose a plan, sign a three year contract and that's it.

45
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,539
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now.

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,419
And we're giving away a BlackBerry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

47
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,219
So what does this plan include?

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,879
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tell mobile clients.

49
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,740
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

50
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:49,500
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

51
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,460
Wow.

52
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,919
All this for $40 per month.

53
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,460
That's right.

54
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,500
Plus the activation fee and the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee.

55
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,960
Oh, and any charges for extra minutes and...

56
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Well, it sounds like a lot more than $40, doesn't it?

57
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,599
This is very common.

58
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,780
They always say that it's a very low price and they always have these hidden charges, right?

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,879
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,680
So why don't we look at some of the language they were using in the dialogue now in Language Takeaway.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,819
Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:34,400
Alright, on Language Takeaway today, we're going to be looking at four very basic words that are used in this whole mobile phone context.

63
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,939
And the first one is activate.

64
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,800
To activate my cell phone.

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,960
Alright, so you have to activate your cell phone.

66
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:43,819
That's right.

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,199
You have to make the cell phone work.

68
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,740
So basically you make it work.

69
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,439
Now, can you only apply this to mobile phones?

70
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,659
No, there's many things that you must activate to make work.

71
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,240
For example, you must activate your computer software.

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay, or maybe you have to activate your credit card.

73
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,460
Or activate your bank account.

74
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,680
So usually you do this for the first time before you start using it.

75
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,740
Yeah, like imagine your mobile phone is sleeping, right?

76
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,199
And you need to activate it to make it start working.

77
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,199
But you only do it once.

78
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,159
Right, only once.

79
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,279
Okay, we talk about mobile phone or we say the cell phone, but this also has a specific name, right?

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,959
That's right, a handset.

81
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,439
Handset.

82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,240
A handset.

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,279
And call it a handset.

84
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,180
Exactly.

85
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,519
Alright, a very easy word, but it's kind of a little bit more technical.

86
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:34,959
Yeah.

87
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:43,720
Now, one of the things they were talking about with this monthly rate plan was a rollover option.

88
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,199
Rollover.

89
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:46,779
A rollover option.

90
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,079
So what is this rollover option about?

91
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,459
Well, okay, I'll give you an example.

92
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,620
Let's say you have 500 minutes each month.

93
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,899
And you only use 4 of them in this month.

94
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,800
100 of those minutes can rollover, can move over to the next month.

95
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,040
So now you have 600 minutes.

96
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,180
So basically the minutes that you don't use, you can still use the following month.

97
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:10,639
Right.

98
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,300
Okay, so that's a rollover plan.

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,259
Now we might recognize the verb to rollover, right?

100
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,939
Right, so it's very similar to physically move from one place to another.

101
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:22,339
Yep.

102
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,560
Alright, rollover.

103
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,759
And now in the end we talked about many types of fees.

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,180
That's right, activation fee.

105
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,660
Okay, or we also had emergency services fee.

106
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,439
So what is a fee?

107
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,180
A fee is the amount of money you must pay for a service.

108
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:43,040
Okay, so this is important, it's for a service.

109
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,800
Yep, you can't pay a fee for something you can touch.

110
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:54,800
Okay, so if I go to the store, I don't say, what is the fee for filling this bottle of water?

111
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:56,259
Okay, so for a service.

112
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,180
Yes, for an action.

113
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,480
Alright, very good.

114
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,459
So I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

115
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,360
We're going to slow it down because it was a little bit fast.

116
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:08,160
And then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

117
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,459
Hi there, can I help you?

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,399
Yeah, I've just moved here.

119
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:27,279
And I'd like to if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

120
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:28,620
I see.

121
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:31,319
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

122
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,879
Unfortunately, this phone can't be used in the US.

123
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,160
It's not compatible with our 3g network.

124
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,879
What?

125
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,160
Really?

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,839
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

127
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,480
Well, you're plan will throw in a handset for free.

128
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:53,699
Really?

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,519
What's the catch?

130
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,040
There's no catch.

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,120
You just choose a plan, sign a three year contract, and that's it.

132
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,800
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now.

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,939
And we're giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

134
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,079
So what does this plan include?

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:29,439
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes, and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tell mobile clients 1000 text messages per month, and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

136
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,720
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

137
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:33,660
Wow.

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,819
All this for $40 per month.

139
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:37,839
That's right.

140
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,839
Plus the activation fee, the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee.

141
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:53,759
Oh, and any charges for extra minutes and Well, you know, there's some interesting phrases in this dialogue.

142
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,259
And you know, a lot of them can be used when you're talking about a negotiation or a contract or a deal.

143
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,040
All right, great.

144
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,879
So let's take a look at these phrases in fluency builder.

145
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:06,620
Fluency builder.

146
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:16,839
Okay, the first phrase that we have on fluency builder today was the problem that she had with her mobile phone was that it wasn't compatible with a 3g network.

147
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:26,660
Okay, to be compatible with to be compatible with to be compatible with now this word compatible means that it works well with something else.

148
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,139
Exactly.

149
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:34,379
Now, there's a lot of things that you can use this phrase compatible with together with, you know, people things.

150
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,019
So why don't we hear a few examples now.

151
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,220
Example one.

152
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,240
Our application is compatible with most smartphones.

153
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,360
Example two.

154
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,759
My roommate and I are just not compatible.

155
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,519
All she ever does is study.

156
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,519
And I like to stay up late and party.

157
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,139
Example three.

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,299
I'm sorry, your computer is not compatible with our software.

159
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:02,279
It's too old.

160
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,759
Okay, great example.

161
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,080
So compatible with very clear and it's very useful.

162
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:08,820
That's right.

163
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Now, what about the next phrase?

164
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:19,080
Well, you know, the girl was hearing about all of these great things that are included in the contract and she asked, what's the catch?

165
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,559
What's the catch?

166
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,460
What's the catch?

167
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,919
So she was asking for the catch.

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,419
What is the catch?

169
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,740
Well, good thing you asked.

170
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,700
A catch is something negative, something that's hidden, that makes the deal seem not so great.

171
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:38,559
Okay, so if somebody offers me a new car, they say you can have this new for free.

172
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,059
Okay, well, that seems too good to be true.

173
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,639
So what is the catch?

174
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,360
The catch is that I can only drive it at night.

175
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,080
Okay, that's kind of annoying.

176
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,740
Right, so that's the catch.

177
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,039
There's like a condition.

178
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,220
Now, she asked about the catch and she said, well, there's no catch, you know, you just signed the contract.

179
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,639
And then the salesman told the lady that she is in luck.

180
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:02,720
You're in luck.

181
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,500
To be in luck.

182
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,899
Well, okay, I think we can really understand the meaning, right?

183
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,019
When you're in luck, something lucky has happened.

184
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:11,960
Right, you're having good fortune.

185
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,700
But how do we use it?

186
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,179
So maybe you're looking for a very special bottle of wine for dinner tonight.

187
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,299
Yep, it's very rare.

188
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,200
Okay, and you go into this little store and all of a sudden you're in luck.

189
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
You found it there.

190
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:24,759
Exactly.

191
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,480
Okay.

192
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,000
This phrase is actually most commonly used in the second person.

193
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,240
You're in luck.

194
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,379
You are in luck.

195
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,700
You are in luck tonight.

196
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:38,320
Yeah, and usually when someone asks you for something, then you say, you're in luck.

197
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,600
You're in luck, I have it.

198
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,820
Or, you're in luck, I have the very last one.

199
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,500
Exactly.

200
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:52,639
Alright, and now to end Affluency Builder, we have one more phrase and so it was when the salesman said, we'll throw in a handset for free.

201
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,100
Alright, to throw something in.

202
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,980
So if she signs the contract, he will throw in a free handset.

203
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,820
It means to include something for free.

204
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,240
Okay, so you can say, if you buy this house, I'll throw in the dog.

205
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,340
The dog for free, right?

206
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,679
So to throw in, to include for free.

207
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,000
Right.

208
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,919
Okay, alright, so great phrases and I think we understand them now, so let's listen to this dialogue for the very last time.

209
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:36,879
Yeah, I just moved here and I'd like to activate my cell phone and I'm not sure if I should go with a prepaid plan or a monthly rate plan.

210
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:38,039
I see.

211
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:39,720
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

212
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,080
Unfortunately this phone can't be used in the U.S.

213
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,039
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

214
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:46,620
What?

215
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:46,980
Really?

216
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,159
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

217
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, you're in luck.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,379
You see, if you sign up for our 3 year plan, we'll throw in a handset for free.

219
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:55,139
Really?

220
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,299
What's the catch?

221
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,080
There's no catch.

222
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,100
You just choose a plan, sign a 3 year contract and that's it.

223
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,679
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now and we're giving away a blackberry curve with our special mega value $40 plan.

224
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,460
So, what does this plan include?

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,100
Well, you get 900 anytime minutes and you can also enjoy free mobile to mobile calling to other tell mobile clients.

226
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,980
A thousand text messages per month and unlimited evening and weekend minutes.

227
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,759
Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

228
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Wow.

229
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,159
All this for $40 per month?

230
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:26,720
That's right.

231
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,779
Plus the activation fee and the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee.

232
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:39,360
Oh, and any charges for extra minutes and mobile phones.

233
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,740
This is very common in the United States, right?

234
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,960
These monthly plans.

235
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:43,539
Yeah.

236
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,940
Most places where I have lived, it's much more common to pay as you go, right?

237
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,840
To have a prepaid plan.

238
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,820
But in the States, almost everyone goes with the monthly plan.

239
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,899
Maybe it's because in order to have a monthly plan, you need to have a credit card.

240
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
You might be on to something.

241
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:01,759
Right?

242
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,519
So, if you don't have a credit card or maybe you're 18, you can't get a monthly plan.

243
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,720
So, you gotta do this prepaid plan.

244
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:09,059
Yeah.

245
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:23,659
You know, another interesting thing that I've noticed when living in different countries and seeing mobile phone habits, Americans and North Americans respond very differently to a ringing mobile phone than other people do.

246
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,259
How so?

247
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:33,059
For example, if I was in a meeting in America and my phone rang and I answered it, people might think that I was very rude to answer the phone in a meeting.

248
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,500
But you know, here when we're living in China, it's totally normal.

249
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,919
It's, you know, everyone does it.

250
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:39,399
That's the polite thing to do.

251
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:40,120
Answer your phone.

252
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:40,840
Right.

253
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,419
And I think that's absolutely true.

254
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,220
And maybe it's because in North America, you have this voicemail option for your mobile phone.

255
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:49,379
Yeah.

256
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,220
And everyone has it.

257
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,980
Everyone has it.

258
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:57,779
So, if it's something very important, then the person will leave you a voicemail message and then you will know what it's about or you can call them back.

259
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,379
But here, I guess, or in other countries, maybe they don't have that option.

260
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:03,960
So, they need to answer every call.

261
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:04,460
Yeah.

262
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,360
It's interesting.

263
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,139
An interesting sort of cultural difference in the way we use our phones.

264
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:10,519
But what about listeners?

265
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,639
In your country, do you answer the phone immediately or do you let it ring?

266
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,259
Right.

267
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,240
Or maybe do you see who's calling and maybe just not answer it.

268
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:18,440
Yeah.

269
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:19,360
I screen your calls.

270
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,200
I screen a call.

271
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,840
