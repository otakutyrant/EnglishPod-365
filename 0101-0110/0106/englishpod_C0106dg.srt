00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:15,140
I see.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,820
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,120
Unfortunately this phone can't be used in the US.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,140
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,179
What?

00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,260

Really?

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,399
What's the catch?

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,179
There's no catch.

14
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,219
You just choose a plan, sign a 3-year contract, and that's it.

15
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,759
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now and we're giving away a BlackBerry Curve with our special MegaValue $40 plan.

16
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,579
So what does this plan include?

Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,259
All this for $40 per month?
