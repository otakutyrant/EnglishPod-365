00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I see.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, can I have a look at your phone?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Unfortunately this phone can't be used in the US.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's not compatible with our 3G network.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What?

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Really?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't really want to have to buy a new phone.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Really?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's the catch?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There's no catch.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You just choose a plan, sign a 3-year contract, and that's it.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Actually, we're running a special promotion right now and we're giving away a BlackBerry Curve with our special MegaValue $40 plan.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So what does this plan include?

Oh, and we also offer a rollover option.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
All this for $40 per month?
