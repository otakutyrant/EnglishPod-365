00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:11,619
Welcome, ski lovers of all ages.

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,439
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

3
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,719
Thank you, Rick.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,100
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12 inches of fresh powder.

5
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,559
It doesn't get much better than this.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,300
That's right, Bob.

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
We're joined here by Ian Rusey, four-time giant slalom champion.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,100
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,539
So let's hit the slopes.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,100
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,600
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,500
That's right.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,119
Now snap them into your bindings.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,000
And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

16
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,719
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,780
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:02,579
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,859
Easy there, Rick.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,340
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,359
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill.

22
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,760
So Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns?

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,799
Gnarly run, Rick.

24
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,879
Nice carving.

25
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,659
You've got some mad skills.

26
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,400
That was sick.

27
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,879
You want to see gnarly?

28
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,379
Well, see that bump over there?

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,959
I'm going to catch some major air.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,980
Ha ha ha.

31
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,019
Butt plant.

32
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,120
Ha ha ha.

33
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,260
He lost his skis.

34
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,319
Yard sale.

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,719
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

36
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,319
I think that about does it.

37
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,980
Bob, Ian, time for some apres ski?

38
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,219
No way, man.

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,739
We're off to grab some freshies.
