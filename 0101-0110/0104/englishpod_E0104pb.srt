00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:09,599
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,300
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,240
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,780
And today we're bringing you another part of our sports series, and this time it's an advanced lesson.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,420
That's right.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,100
We're heading to the mountains today to take a skiing lesson.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,000
All right.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,719
So we're going to be learning about skiing, a winter sport, and very popular throughout the world.

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,239
So before we get started, why don't we take a look at a couple of words in Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,140
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,240
All right.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,000
So we're going to hear these two words in our dialogue.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,960
The first one is fresh powder.

15
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,320
Fresh powder.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,060
Fresh powder.

17
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:41,960
Okay.

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:42,920
So powder.

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,320
We probably know this phrase already.

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:44,600
Yeah.

21
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:48,520
But here we're talking about fresh, light snow.

22
00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:49,780
So fresh, light snow.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Snow that recently fell.

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,560
Yep.

25
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,119
Okay.

26
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,719
So it looks like powder.

27
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,039
The best kind for skiing on.

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:56,700
Okay.

29
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:57,700
The best kind.

30
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:58,380
All right.

31
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,380
So fresh powder.

32
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,939
What about our next phrase?

33
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,400
Well, we're also going to meet a four-time giant slalom champion.

34
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,319
All right.

35
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,859
A four-time giant slalom champion.

36
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,700
So giant slalom is a type of ski race.

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,939
You probably see it on TV when they go down the hill and they have to go through these red or blue flags, right?

38
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,760
Now four-time giant slalom champion means he won the giant slalom four times.

39
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:24,819
Yes.

40
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,280
Okay.

41
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,939
So this is an interesting way of saying that somebody did something many times.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,319
Right.

43
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,900
So I can say the three-time Nobel Prize winner.

44
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:34,620
Yes.

45
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,079
Exactly.

46
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:35,640
Okay.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
Or the five-time Olympic gold medalist.

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,099
Okay.

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,560
Perfect.

50
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:46,120
So now it's time for us to go to the mountains with our famous Rick Fields and Bob Copeland and we'll see what happens.

51
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,760
Welcome, ski lovers of all ages.

52
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:03,599
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

53
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:04,859
Thank you, Rick.

54
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:12,259
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12 inches of fresh powder.

55
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,719
It doesn't get much better than this.

56
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,460
That's right, Bob.

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,199
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

58
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,539
We're joined here by Ian Rucy, four-time giant slalom champion.

59
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:25,259
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,680
So let's hit the slopes.

61
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,259
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

62
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,759
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

63
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,659
That's right.

64
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:38,159
Now snap them into your bindings and you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

65
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,879
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,979
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,759
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have a good, warm pair of dry ski gloves.

68
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
Easy there, Rick.

69
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,460
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,939
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns?

71
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,960
Gnarly run, Rick.

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,039
Nice carving.

73
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,780
You've got some mad skills.

74
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,599
That was sick.

75
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:14,939
You want to see gnarly?

76
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:16,560
Well, see that bump over there?

77
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm going to catch some major air.

78
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

79
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,199
Butt plant.

80
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,240
Ha, ha, ha.

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,419
He lost his skis.

82
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,500
Yard sale.

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,879
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

84
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,599
I think that about does it.

85
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,139
Bob, Ian, time for some apres-ski?

86
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,379
No way, man.

87
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,939
We're off to grab some freshies.

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Pretty embarrassing for Rick there, wasn't it?

89
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,639
Yeah, he was a little bit cocky, and then he ended up falling.

90
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,479
Well, I think there's a lesson in that for all of us, but what the real lesson is today is language.

91
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,939
So, why don't we start with language takeaway?

92
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,680
All right, on language takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word.

93
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:05,620
We have some bindings.

94
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:06,919
Bindings.

95
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,759
Bindings.

96
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,439
Bindings are sort of like a lock that attaches your boot to your ski.

97
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,639
So, those are the bindings.

98
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,600
I guess it comes from the verb to bind.

99
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,040
Yeah, to tie something so that it stays.

100
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,759
Okay, binding.

101
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,319
So, for example, my bindings are broken.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,120
Okay, and another piece of skiing equipment and very important is goggles.

103
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,879
Goggles.

104
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,040
Okay, we have goggles now.

105
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,079
Yep, not to be confused with Google.

106
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,060
It's spelled almost the same way, huh?

107
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,339
Yep, but goggles are kind of like, imagine a big pair of glasses that you wear when you ski.

108
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,300
So, it makes people kind of look like flies.

109
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,939
Yes.

110
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,220
They have these huge glasses.

111
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,279
Yeah, and you'll also see safety goggles, which you might wear if you are a mechanic fixing a car or someone working with wood or chemicals or what have you.

112
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,259
Okay, so goggles basically protect your eyes from snow, from the sun, from anything.

113
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:00,899
That's right.

114
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,959
All right.

115
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,279
So, moving on to our next keyword.

116
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:10,079
They said you should wear the goggles so that you don't accidentally go over the moguls.

117
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,220
Okay, moguls.

118
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,959
Moguls.

119
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,319
Okay, moguls.

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,600
It sounds kind of strange.

121
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,680
What are these things?

122
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,120
Basically, these are the bumps that are in a ski hill.

123
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:20,899
Bumps.

124
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,680
Okay, so they're kind of like mini little hills.

125
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:24,060
Yep.

126
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,920
And they're very difficult to ski over, right?

127
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,339
That's right.

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,680
You got to be pretty good to handle those moguls.

129
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:30,500
Okay.

130
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,060
Now, since these guys are beginner skiers, they're starting out on the bunny hill.

131
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,300
A bunny hill?

132
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,220
The bunny hill.

133
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay, very popular among skiers.

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,459
Because the bunny hill is the easiest hill.

135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,319
So it's where the beginners start to learn.

136
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,339
Yeah, all the kids.

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,019
All the kids are on the bunny hill.

138
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:47,839
All right.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,980
And our final words.

140
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,519
Actually, we're going to look at two words here because they mean almost exactly the same thing.

141
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,980
We heard the ski instructor say, gnarly.

142
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,519
Gnarly run.

143
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,660
Yeah, gnarly.

144
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,079
So, an interesting word.

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,600
It's spelled G-N-A-R-L-E-Y.

146
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:05,040
Okay.

147
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,899
So, but you don't say gnarly.

148
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,160
No.

149
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,459
You say gnarly.

150
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:08,759
Yep.

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,180
And a related word, sick.

152
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:12,060
Okay.

153
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,560
Now, sick means to be sick, right?

154
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:15,379
No, no, no.

155
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,980
Not here.

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,300
Let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

157
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:20,480
Example one.

158
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,560
Those were some sick dance moves.

159
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,600
You are amazing.

160
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,819
Example two.

161
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,480
Jack and I went to the beach yesterday and surfed some really gnarly waves.

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,560
Example three.

163
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,199
Man, the concert last night was sick.

164
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,519
I can't believe we got front row seats.

165
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:46,980
Okay.

166
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,579
So, basically, gnarly and sick, they mean that it's amazing.

167
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,220
It was cool.

168
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:51,819
It's awesome.

169
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,420
Awesome.

170
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,740
Yep.

171
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:55,860
So, these two words are very, very informal.

172
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,019
It's slang.

173
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah.

174
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,259
And actually, skier slang.

175
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,740
Both of these words, I think, originated with skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders.

176
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,720
Gnarly dudes.

177
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,379
Gnarly dudes.

178
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:06,019
Okay.

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,680
So, that's all the words we have for language takeaway, but we have some great phrases that we want to take a look at before we listen to the dialogue again.

180
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,100
So, it's time now for Fluency Builder.

181
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,240
Fluency Builder.

182
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,379
All right.

183
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,740
So, Rick said that it is time to...

184
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,639
So, Rick invited everyone to start skiing by saying, let's hit the slopes.

185
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:28,379
Okay.

186
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,779
So, to hit the slopes.

187
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,819
To hit the slopes.

188
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,759
Okay.

189
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,220
Now, we want to hit the slopes.

190
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,000
What does that mean?

191
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:35,860
Go skiing.

192
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,819
Let's go skiing.

193
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,939
Let's go to the mountain.

194
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:38,360
Yep.

195
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,459
Now, we can change the noun slope for something else, right?

196
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:42,740
Yeah.

197
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,620
You can change it for a lot of other different nouns.

198
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,939
And why don't we hear some examples of how you can do that?

199
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,839
Example one.

200
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:55,759
I really have to hit the books and study for my exam tomorrow.

201
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:58,439
Example two.

202
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:00,920
I'm really tired.

203
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,180
I think I'm going to hit the bed now.

204
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,480
Example three.

205
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,660
Honey, can we hit the supermarket on our way home?

206
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:11,980
I need to buy some milk.

207
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,540
Okay, great.

208
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,560
So, great examples and now we understand how we can use the hit the something.

209
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,660
All right.

210
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,019
What about our next phrase?

211
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,439
Well, Rick warned Bob that he might take a few spills.

212
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,180
Okay.

213
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,360
So, to take a spill.

214
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,279
To take a spill.

215
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,800
Take a spill.

216
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,420
To fall.

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,180
To fall.

218
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,720
It means like a light fall?

219
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,299
Pretty dramatic fall.

220
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:35,879
Pretty dramatic.

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,539
So, you fell.

222
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:36,919
Yeah.

223
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,480
So, for example, instead of saying that little girl was riding her bike and she fell.

224
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,340
I can say that little girl was riding her bike and she took a bad spill.

225
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:47,820
Yep.

226
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay.

227
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:50,139
So, to take a spill.

228
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,720
You have to use the verb take though.

229
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,059
Yes.

230
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:52,500
Exactly.

231
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,720
You cannot just spill.

232
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,600
Okay.

233
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,860
You have to take a spill.

234
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,080
All right.

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,080
What about our next phrase?

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,519
Well, you might take a spill when you catch some major air.

237
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,559
Catch some major air.

238
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,980
To catch some major air.

239
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,159
So, am I catching something?

240
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,740
How am I catching air?

241
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,419
That's impossible.

242
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:13,500
Well, imagine if you're jumping and your skis are catching the air.

243
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,320
Okay.

244
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,419
So, I'm in the air for a very long time maybe?

245
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:17,980
Yeah.

246
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,860
When you catch some air, basically it's like you're flying for a couple seconds.

247
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,240
So, you're flying for a couple of seconds.

248
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,580
You're very high up in the air.

249
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:24,820
Yep.

250
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:25,639
Okay.

251
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,980
To catch some air.

252
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:37,379
And you'll hear this phrase not only when you're talking about skiing but also maybe if you're driving your car really fast and it sort of jumps up in the air for a minute.

253
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,139
Well, not a minute.

254
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,799
A second.

255
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,720
That would be catching air as well.

256
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,039
Okay.

257
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:43,000
So, to catch air.

258
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,559
All right.

259
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,580
So, they finished skiing.

260
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,639
They were kind of tired and he said, well, let's call it a day.

261
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
To call it a day.

262
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,240
Let's call it a day.

263
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,139
Let's go home.

264
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,159
Let's go home.

265
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:53,820
It's over.

266
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:54,840
Let's finish.

267
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,799
Let's finish the day.

268
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,039
Yep.

269
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,759
Let's call it a day and go home.

270
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:58,259
Mm-hmm.

271
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:03,159
But not before we go to our next word to grab some freshies.

272
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:03,759
All right.

273
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,919
Grab some freshies.

274
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,019
Grab some freshies.

275
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:06,960
Okay.

276
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,820
Freshies.

277
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,080
What are these freshies?

278
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,600
Remember we talked about fresh powder?

279
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,220
Mm-hmm.

280
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:13,059
It's that.

281
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,460
So, it's an informal way of saying fresh powder.

282
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:15,879
Yeah.

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Fresh powdery light snow.

284
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

285
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:18,759
Freshies.

286
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,019
Yep.

287
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,320
So, the snow that nobody has skied on before.

288
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,159
Really good phrases and some amazing vocabulary.

289
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:30,899
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this really fun sport.

290
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,820
Welcome ski lovers of all ages.

291
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,639
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

292
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,980
Thank you, Rick.

293
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,320
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12 inches of fresh powder.

294
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,799
It doesn't get much better than this.

295
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,519
That's right, Bob.

296
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,279
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

297
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,639
We're joined here by Ian Russey, four-time giant slalom champion.

298
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,340
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

299
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,799
So, let's hit the slopes.

300
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,340
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

301
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,840
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

302
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,740
That's right.

303
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,299
Now, snap them into your bindings.

304
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,240
And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

305
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,960
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

306
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,100
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

307
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,799
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

308
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,100
Easy there, Rick.

309
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,559
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

310
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,279
All right.

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,600
We're up here on the bunny hill.

312
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,000
So, Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns.

313
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,019
Gnarly run, Rick.

314
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,120
Nice carving.

315
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,879
You've got some mad skills.

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,659
That was sick.

317
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,039
You want to see gnarly?

318
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,620
Well, see that bump over there?

319
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,159
I'm going to catch some major air.

320
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,240
Ha ha ha.

321
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:04,279
Butt plant.

322
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,340
Ha ha ha.

323
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:06,519
He lost his skis.

324
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,580
Yard sale.

325
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,960
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

326
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,620
I think that about does it.

327
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,220
Bob, Ian, time for some apres ski?

328
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,440
No way, man.

329
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,980
We're off to grab some freshies.

330
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,139
Thank you.

331
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:30,340
Well, we heard the guys talk about apres ski, and actually this is one of my favorite parts of skiing.

332
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,539
What is this?

333
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,500
It sounds French.

334
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah, it is.

335
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,600
I guess the Frenchness sort of gives it an air of specialness, right?

336
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:42,279
But apres ski is basically the party that you have after you're finished skiing.

337
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,440
So, usually you would have parties after skiing.

338
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,879
Right, so you finish your ski day.

339
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,720
You've called it a day.

340
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,940
You've glided down those slopes.

341
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,159
You head on over to the lodge, you know, the little cabin.

342
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,500
Grab a beer or two or maybe some hot alcoholic drink and kick back and relax with your friends.

343
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:00,820
Wow.

344
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,960
So, it's popular for families to go to a ski resort and stay there for a couple of days.

345
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,559
So, this is when you would do this with your friends or family.

346
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,820
And you know what?

347
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,620
If it's with your friends, it's going to last until late into the night.

348
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,720
Alright, so it sounds fun.

349
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:26,519
And next time, maybe if you go skiing with your friends and you guys are speaking English now, you can use all these great phrases and maybe surprise your friends if you tell them, let's go grab some freshies or something like that.

350
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,100
Yeah, you'll sound pretty, pretty dialed.

351
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:29,620
Pretty cool.

352
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,899
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

353
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,899
Be sure to check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

354
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,139
Marco and I are always around to answer your questions.

355
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:39,960
And, well, thanks for downloading.

356
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,460
Until next time, goodbye.

357
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:41,899
Bye.
