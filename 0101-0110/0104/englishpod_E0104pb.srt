00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we're bringing you another part of our sports series, and this time it's an advanced lesson.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're heading to the mountains today to take a skiing lesson.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All right.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we're going to be learning about skiing, a winter sport, and very popular throughout the world.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So before we get started, why don't we take a look at a couple of words in Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So we're going to hear these two words in our dialogue.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The first one is fresh powder.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Fresh powder.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Fresh powder.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So powder.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We probably know this phrase already.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But here we're talking about fresh, light snow.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So fresh, light snow.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Snow that recently fell.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yep.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So it looks like powder.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The best kind for skiing on.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The best kind.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All right.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So fresh powder.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What about our next phrase?

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, we're also going to meet a four-time giant slalom champion.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All right.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A four-time giant slalom champion.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So giant slalom is a type of ski race.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You probably see it on TV when they go down the hill and they have to go through these red or blue flags, right?

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now four-time giant slalom champion means he won the giant slalom four times.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okay.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So this is an interesting way of saying that somebody did something many times.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Right.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I can say the three-time Nobel Prize winner.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Exactly.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Or the five-time Olympic gold medalist.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Perfect.

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So now it's time for us to go to the mountains with our famous Rick Fields and Bob Copeland and we'll see what happens.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Welcome, ski lovers of all ages.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you, Rick.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12 inches of fresh powder.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It doesn't get much better than this.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right, Bob.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're joined here by Ian Rucy, four-time giant slalom champion.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So let's hit the slopes.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now snap them into your bindings and you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have a good, warm pair of dry ski gloves.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Easy there, Rick.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
All right, we're up here on the bunny hill, so Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns?

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Gnarly run, Rick.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Nice carving.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You've got some mad skills.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That was sick.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You want to see gnarly?

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, see that bump over there?

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to catch some major air.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Butt plant.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ha, ha, ha.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He lost his skis.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yard sale.

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think that about does it.

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Bob, Ian, time for some apres-ski?

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No way, man.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We're off to grab some freshies.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Pretty embarrassing for Rick there, wasn't it?

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah, he was a little bit cocky, and then he ended up falling.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, I think there's a lesson in that for all of us, but what the real lesson is today is language.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So, why don't we start with language takeaway?

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, on language takeaway today, let's take a look at the first word.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We have some bindings.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Bindings.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Bindings.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Bindings are sort of like a lock that attaches your boot to your ski.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, those are the bindings.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I guess it comes from the verb to bind.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, to tie something so that it stays.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, binding.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, for example, my bindings are broken.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, and another piece of skiing equipment and very important is goggles.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Goggles.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, we have goggles now.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yep, not to be confused with Google.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's spelled almost the same way, huh?

107
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yep, but goggles are kind of like, imagine a big pair of glasses that you wear when you ski.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, it makes people kind of look like flies.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
They have these huge glasses.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, and you'll also see safety goggles, which you might wear if you are a mechanic fixing a car or someone working with wood or chemicals or what have you.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay, so goggles basically protect your eyes from snow, from the sun, from anything.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So, moving on to our next keyword.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They said you should wear the goggles so that you don't accidentally go over the moguls.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, moguls.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Moguls.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, moguls.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It sounds kind of strange.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are these things?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Basically, these are the bumps that are in a ski hill.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Bumps.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay, so they're kind of like mini little hills.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yep.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And they're very difficult to ski over, right?

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's right.

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You got to be pretty good to handle those moguls.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, since these guys are beginner skiers, they're starting out on the bunny hill.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A bunny hill?

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The bunny hill.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, very popular among skiers.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Because the bunny hill is the easiest hill.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's where the beginners start to learn.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, all the kids.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All the kids are on the bunny hill.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right.

139
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And our final words.

140
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Actually, we're going to look at two words here because they mean almost exactly the same thing.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We heard the ski instructor say, gnarly.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Gnarly run.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, gnarly.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So, an interesting word.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's spelled G-N-A-R-L-E-Y.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So, but you don't say gnarly.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No.

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You say gnarly.

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yep.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And a related word, sick.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

153
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now, sick means to be sick, right?

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, no, no.

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Not here.

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's listen to some examples to help us understand.

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Example one.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Those were some sick dance moves.

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You are amazing.

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Example two.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Jack and I went to the beach yesterday and surfed some really gnarly waves.

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Example three.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Man, the concert last night was sick.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't believe we got front row seats.

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay.

166
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, basically, gnarly and sick, they mean that it's amazing.

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It was cool.

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's awesome.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Awesome.

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yep.

171
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So, these two words are very, very informal.

172
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's slang.

173
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And actually, skier slang.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Both of these words, I think, originated with skiers, snowboarders, skateboarders.

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Gnarly dudes.

177
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Gnarly dudes.

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, that's all the words we have for language takeaway, but we have some great phrases that we want to take a look at before we listen to the dialogue again.

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So, it's time now for Fluency Builder.

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Fluency Builder.

182
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
All right.

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, Rick said that it is time to...

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So, Rick invited everyone to start skiing by saying, let's hit the slopes.

185
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

186
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, to hit the slopes.

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
To hit the slopes.

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Now, we want to hit the slopes.

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What does that mean?

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go skiing.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go skiing.

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go to the mountain.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yep.

195
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Now, we can change the noun slope for something else, right?

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You can change it for a lot of other different nouns.

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And why don't we hear some examples of how you can do that?

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Example one.

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I really have to hit the books and study for my exam tomorrow.

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Example two.

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm really tired.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I think I'm going to hit the bed now.

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Example three.

205
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Honey, can we hit the supermarket on our way home?

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I need to buy some milk.

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay, great.

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So, great examples and now we understand how we can use the hit the something.

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
All right.

210
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What about our next phrase?

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, Rick warned Bob that he might take a few spills.

212
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So, to take a spill.

214
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
To take a spill.

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Take a spill.

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To fall.

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
To fall.

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It means like a light fall?

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Pretty dramatic fall.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Pretty dramatic.

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So, you fell.

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yeah.

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, for example, instead of saying that little girl was riding her bike and she fell.

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can say that little girl was riding her bike and she took a bad spill.

225
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yep.

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

227
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So, to take a spill.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You have to use the verb take though.

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes.

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Exactly.

231
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You cannot just spill.

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You have to take a spill.

234
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
All right.

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What about our next phrase?

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, you might take a spill when you catch some major air.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Catch some major air.

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
To catch some major air.

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So, am I catching something?

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How am I catching air?

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's impossible.

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, imagine if you're jumping and your skis are catching the air.

243
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So, I'm in the air for a very long time maybe?

245
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

246
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When you catch some air, basically it's like you're flying for a couple seconds.

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So, you're flying for a couple of seconds.

248
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're very high up in the air.

249
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yep.

250
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
To catch some air.

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you'll hear this phrase not only when you're talking about skiing but also maybe if you're driving your car really fast and it sort of jumps up in the air for a minute.

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, not a minute.

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A second.

255
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That would be catching air as well.

256
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay.

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So, to catch air.

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
All right.

259
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So, they finished skiing.

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They were kind of tired and he said, well, let's call it a day.

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
To call it a day.

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's call it a day.

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's go home.

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's go home.

265
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's over.

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's finish.

267
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's finish the day.

268
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yep.

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's call it a day and go home.

270
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Mm-hmm.

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But not before we go to our next word to grab some freshies.

272
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All right.

273
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Grab some freshies.

274
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Grab some freshies.

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

276
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Freshies.

277
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What are these freshies?

278
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Remember we talked about fresh powder?

279
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mm-hmm.

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's that.

281
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So, it's an informal way of saying fresh powder.

282
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah.

283
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Fresh powdery light snow.

284
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

285
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Freshies.

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yep.

287
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So, the snow that nobody has skied on before.

288
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Really good phrases and some amazing vocabulary.

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this really fun sport.

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Welcome ski lovers of all ages.

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man that needs no introduction, Bob Copeland.

292
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you, Rick.

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What a beautiful day here in Aspen, Colorado, where the sun is shining and we've got 12 inches of fresh powder.

294
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It doesn't get much better than this.

295
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's right, Bob.

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But today we have a special treat for our viewers.

297
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We're joined here by Ian Russey, four-time giant slalom champion.

298
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And on this special edition of the show, Ian is going to teach us the basics of skiing.

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So, let's hit the slopes.

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, first off, let's get those boots on.

301
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're going to want to make sure your boots fit snugly.

302
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's right.

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now, snap them into your bindings.

304
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And you're also going to want a good pair of goggles to protect your eyes.

305
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's a bright day today, so there's going to be a lot of glare out there on the slopes.

306
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We don't want you hitting any of those moguls.

307
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Bob, since you're a beginner skier and might take a few spills, it's a good idea to have a good warm pair of dry ski gloves.

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Easy there, Rick.

309
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, let's head over onto the chairlift and test your skills.

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
All right.

311
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We're up here on the bunny hill.

312
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So, Bob, why don't you do a few snowplow turns.

313
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Gnarly run, Rick.

314
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Nice carving.

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You've got some mad skills.

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That was sick.

317
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You want to see gnarly?

318
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well, see that bump over there?

319
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to catch some major air.

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ha ha ha.

321
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Butt plant.

322
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Ha ha ha.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He lost his skis.

324
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yard sale.

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well, thanks for joining us here today.

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think that about does it.

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Bob, Ian, time for some apres ski?

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No way, man.

329
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We're off to grab some freshies.

330
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you.

331
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, we heard the guys talk about apres ski, and actually this is one of my favorite parts of skiing.

332
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What is this?

333
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It sounds French.

334
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, it is.

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I guess the Frenchness sort of gives it an air of specialness, right?

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But apres ski is basically the party that you have after you're finished skiing.

337
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, usually you would have parties after skiing.

338
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Right, so you finish your ski day.

339
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You've called it a day.

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You've glided down those slopes.

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You head on over to the lodge, you know, the little cabin.

342
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Grab a beer or two or maybe some hot alcoholic drink and kick back and relax with your friends.

343
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wow.

344
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, it's popular for families to go to a ski resort and stay there for a couple of days.

345
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So, this is when you would do this with your friends or family.

346
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And you know what?

347
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If it's with your friends, it's going to last until late into the night.

348
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Alright, so it sounds fun.

349
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And next time, maybe if you go skiing with your friends and you guys are speaking English now, you can use all these great phrases and maybe surprise your friends if you tell them, let's go grab some freshies or something like that.

350
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, you'll sound pretty, pretty dialed.

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Pretty cool.

352
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

353
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Be sure to check out our website, EnglishPod.com.

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Marco and I are always around to answer your questions.

355
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And, well, thanks for downloading.

356
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Until next time, goodbye.

357
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Bye.
