EnglishPod.com Hey man, how's it hanging?

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,240
Hey man, everything is just groovy, baby.

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,419
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,620
I heard it was far out, man.

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,899
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,940
I was chatting her up a bit, and then we mellowed out at her place.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,600
Right on, right on.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,539
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry, and he said it was dynamite!

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,640
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:36,979
Gravy!

11
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,539
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,079
He's always hitting me up for cash.

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,399
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,299
Yeah, man.

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm starving.
