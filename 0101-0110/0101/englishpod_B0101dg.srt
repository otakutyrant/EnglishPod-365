EnglishPod.com Hey man, how's it hanging?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey man, everything is just groovy, baby.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I heard it was far out, man.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was chatting her up a bit, and then we mellowed out at her place.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Right on, right on.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry, and he said it was dynamite!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Gravy!

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, man.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm starving.
