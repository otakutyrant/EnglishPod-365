00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,900
Hello English learners, welcome back to another edition here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,599
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:08,580
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:16,539
And today we are doing the third part of our Old English series, and today we're transported back to the 1970s.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:27,320
That's right, so we're going to learn some 1970s slang, some phrases that were really popular back in the 70s but are also still in use today.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,039
Exactly.

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,980
So it's going to be a very cool lesson today.

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,960
And before we start with the dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words that we're going to find in Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:45,740
Well, we have two words for you in Vocabulary Preview and they're both found in the dialogue.

10
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,000
The first one, roller rink.

11
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:49,100
A roller rink.

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,060
A roller rink.

13
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,340
Okay, so a roller rink.

14
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,479
Let's break that down and let's look at the first part.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,859
Alright, so roller.

16
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,899
We might recognize this from roller blades or roller skates.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,579
Okay, so yeah, when you go roller blading, roller skating, those things that you put on your feet to skate.

18
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,480
Right, wheels, not like a blade or a knife.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,060
Exactly.

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,420
So that's roller.

21
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,599
And what about rink?

22
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,920
Rink is the place where you do skating.

23
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,200
Okay, so if you go to a roller rink, it's this big area where everyone can roller blade or roller skate.

24
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:21,640
That's right.

25
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,260
Okay.

26
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,359
And what about the next word?

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,120
A block.

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:24,780
Block.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,640
A block.

30
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,120
Okay, so this is a noun.

31
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:27,640
A block.

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,319
And a block is a part of a city that is surrounded by four streets.

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,439
Okay, so a city is made up of many blocks and everyone lives on a block.

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,859
Exactly, so it's a square within the city.

35
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:41,680
Alright, very good.

36
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:46,299
So these are the two words that we previewed and we're going to listen to them now in the dialogue.

37
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:53,079
We're going to hear two guys just talking about normal everyday things, but we're going to be listening to them in 1970.

38
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,060
Hey man, how's it hanging?

39
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,659
Hey man, everything is just groovy, baby.

40
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,860
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,080
I heard it was far out, man.

42
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:19,360
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,400
I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,819
Right on, right on.

45
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,979
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite.

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,139
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

47
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:33,419
Gravy!

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,020
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

49
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,520
He's always hitting me up for cash.

50
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,860
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

51
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,780
Yeah, man.

52
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:43,780
I'm starving.

53
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:56,780
Okay, groovy dialogue.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,280
Yeah, really nice, huh?

55
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,400
All right, so some interesting language in here.

56
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,000
Like we said, it sounds a bit strange, but a lot of this is still used today in modern English.

57
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,139
So why don't we look at some of these words in Language Takeaway?

58
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:17,719
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we have the first word, far out.

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,740
Far out.

60
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,340
That was far out.

61
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,460
To be far out.

62
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,879
Okay, so it's just another way of saying cool.

63
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,419
Cool.

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,080
That was nice.

65
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,020
It was really cool.

66
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,560
So they went to the roller rink.

67
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,379
It was far out.

68
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:33,240
It was really cool, but the other guy couldn't go because he saw a foxy lady.

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
A foxy lady.

70
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,340
Okay, foxy lady.

71
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,699
So basically a foxy lady is a really good looking or sexy woman.

72
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,680
Right, commonly you would hear some men refer to an attractive woman as a fox.

73
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,319
Okay, so foxy lady.

74
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,159
Now Marco, can we say a foxy man?

75
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:53,139
No, this is a phrase that you would only use for women.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,719
Okay, so foxy lady.

77
00:03:54,979 --> 00:03:55,360
Foxy lady.

78
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,419
So after he met up with the foxy lady, they both just decided to mellow out at her place.

79
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,699
To mellow out.

80
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,680
To mellow out.

81
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,360
Okay, so mellow out.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,699
What does this mean exactly?

83
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,659
Basically just to relax.

84
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,259
Right, so to relax, to take it easy.

85
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,939
To mellow out.

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,360
So what did you do on the weekend?

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,319
Oh, nothing.

88
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,920
I just stayed at home and mellowed out.

89
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:17,459
Okay.

90
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Alright, and so the response to that was?

91
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,660
Right on.

92
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:22,500
Right on.

93
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,420
Right on.

94
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,519
Right on.

95
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:25,000
Right on.

96
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,500
And so basically they're saying, okay, good, I agree.

97
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,759
Yeah, this phrase, you can say as good, yeah that's nice, or you can also say it as well, correct, correct, I agree.

98
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,680
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this word in other situations.

99
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,800
Example one.

100
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,339
Right on.

101
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,500
You got a high score.

102
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,360
That's amazing.

103
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,199
Example two.

104
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,259
You got the job?

105
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,180
Right on.

106
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:55,180
Example three.

107
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,180
Jenny was right when she told me she thought Rick was no good for me.

108
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,560
I should have listened to her.

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,120
Okay, so I think that's pretty clear.

110
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,660
We can see how it means, correct, or also, okay, good.

111
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,899
Alright, right on.

112
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,379
And now we also have another word that's similar to far out.

113
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:15,699
He said gravy.

114
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:16,920
Gravy.

115
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:17,759
Gravy.

116
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,399
Gravy.

117
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,139
Now, if you look it up in a dictionary, it's going to tell you something else, right?

118
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,199
Gravy is a sauce you put on meat.

119
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:24,759
Right.

120
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:26,980
But in this case, we say gravy is cool.

121
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:27,860
It's nice.

122
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,259
Yep.

123
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,500
Alright, so gravy.

124
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,279
That was gravy.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,920
Now, finally, at the end of their conversation, they said, wanna book.

126
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:37,819
Okay, let's book.

127
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:39,000
Book.

128
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,759
So, to book, that is a verb.

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,160
Yeah, interesting verb.

130
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,079
It basically means to leave a place quickly.

131
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,839
Okay, so we have to book.

132
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,839
The police are coming.

133
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,199
Right.

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,779
Or, I got a book, guys.

135
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,259
I'm late.

136
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:52,339
So, book.

137
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,420
To leave quickly.

138
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,360
To leave suddenly.

139
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:54,680
Yep.

140
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,939
And that word is used quite commonly today, isn't it?

141
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:57,399
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:59,279
It's used among, like, younger people.

143
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,439
So, you would say, yeah, let's book.

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,339
This party is dead.

145
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,060
Okay, great.

146
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,600
So, there's a lot of pretty cool phrases in this dialogue.

147
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:06,120
Pretty groovy phrases.

148
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,819
Why don't we hear them again in context?

149
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,279
Hey, man.

150
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,519
How's it hangin'?

151
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,160
Hey.

152
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,860
Everything is just groovy, baby.

153
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,620
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

154
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,839
I heard it was far out, man.

155
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:39,759
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

156
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,579
I was chatting her up a bit, and then we mellowed out at her place.

157
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,540
Right on, right on.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,959
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry, and he said it was dinomite.

159
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,660
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

160
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,199
Gravy!

161
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,980
Jim is such a chive turkey, man.

162
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,620
He's always hitting me up for cash.

163
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

164
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:06,920
Yeah, man.

165
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,279
I'm starving.

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:22,540
Alright, so now that we understand these six words that we saw in Language Takeaway, it's time for us now to take a look at some great phrases that we can use today in Fluency Builder.

167
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:31,399
Okay, so at the start of the conversation, there was an interesting way he started talking to his friend, right?

168
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,019
Alright, he said, how's it hangin'?

169
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:34,939
How's it hangin'?

170
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,379
How's it hangin'?

171
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:39,300
Okay, so basically, how is it going?

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,120
How's it going?

173
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:40,800
How are you?

174
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,579
Now, you notice in the spelling that we do have a G at the end, I-N-G, right?

175
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:50,579
Yeah, but usually you don't really pronounce the G in this context, because it's very informal.

176
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,399
So how's it hangin'?

177
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,360
How's it hangin'?

178
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,420
So he said everything was just groovy, and then he started telling him about how he met a girl, and he chat her up a bit.

179
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,459
To chat her up.

180
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,319
Okay, so to chat somebody up.

181
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:11,459
So when you chat someone up, you talk with them, right?

182
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,459
Yeah, you're making conversation.

183
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,779
But it's more than just conversation, isn't it?

184
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:23,160
Yeah, you're trying to be a little bit flirty and maybe say nice romantic phrases or something like that.

185
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,860
Yeah, so usually it's between a woman and a man, right?

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,980
And it's the man who chats up the woman.

187
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,100
Yeah, exactly.

188
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,080
So a little bit of a sexist phrase here.

189
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,539
To chat someone up, or to chat up a girl, right?

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,639
Okay, so he was chatting her up.

191
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,360
That's right.

192
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,460
And so they were talking about how Jim went to the roller rink, but he didn't have any money, right?

193
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,799
Because Jim is always hitting his friends up for cash.

194
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,539
Okay, so to hit someone up.

195
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,620
To hit someone up.

196
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,860
So before we explain this word, let's listen to some other examples so then we can maybe understand the meaning.

197
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,120
Example one.

198
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:04,639
Can you believe Patrick?

199
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,139
Patrick, he came up to me a month ago and tried to hit me up for some money.

200
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,039
Example two.

201
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,700
When I was a kid, I used to always hit my dad up for lunch money.

202
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,679
Example three.

203
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,399
This is the last time I lend you money.

204
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,279
Don't even try to hit me up for more.

205
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,580
All right, so when you hit someone up for something, you ask for it.

206
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,399
So usually it's to ask for money.

207
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:32,919
That's right.

208
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,460
Okay, so to hit someone up.

209
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,539
And now for our last phrase.

210
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,360
Let's book and let's go grab some grub.

211
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,000
To grab some grub.

212
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Grab some grub.

213
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,279
Okay, let's break this one down.

214
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,919
With the final word, grub, what are we talking about?

215
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,299
Grub is an informal way of saying food.

216
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,299
Okay, so to grab some grub is to get some food quickly.

217
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:55,799
Yeah, let's go get some food.

218
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,879
All right, so maybe it's time for us to grab some grub.

219
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,759
And while we're doing that, you can listen to the dialogue one last time.

220
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,220
Hey, man, how's it hanging?

221
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,799
Hey, man, everything is just groovy, baby.

222
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,019
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

223
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,220
I heard it was far out, man.

224
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,519
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

225
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,559
I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

226
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,159
Right on, right on.

227
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,139
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite.

228
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,299
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

229
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,580
Gravy!

230
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,179
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

231
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,720
He's always hitting me up for cash.

232
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:50,000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

233
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,919
Yeah, man, I'm starving.

234
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:15,059
All right, so some interesting phrases, and even though some of these words you may not really commonly hear anymore, they might still be used in movies or something that's related to the disco era because it's very, very popular still, right?

235
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,860
Yeah, that's right.

236
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:24,019
Some of our more advanced users could even use a lot of these phrases in a kind of funny way to reference back to 1970.

237
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,019
Yeah, exactly.

238
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:31,019
So it's fun and, well, you will use them or you will hear them from time to time, even today.
