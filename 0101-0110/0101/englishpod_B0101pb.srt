00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another edition here with us at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we are doing the third part of our Old English series, and today we're transported back to the 1970s.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right, so we're going to learn some 1970s slang, some phrases that were really popular back in the 70s but are also still in use today.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Exactly.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So it's going to be a very cool lesson today.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And before we start with the dialogue, let's take a look at some of the words that we're going to find in Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, we have two words for you in Vocabulary Preview and they're both found in the dialogue.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The first one, roller rink.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A roller rink.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A roller rink.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, so a roller rink.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's break that down and let's look at the first part.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Alright, so roller.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We might recognize this from roller blades or roller skates.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, so yeah, when you go roller blading, roller skating, those things that you put on your feet to skate.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Right, wheels, not like a blade or a knife.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Exactly.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So that's roller.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And what about rink?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Rink is the place where you do skating.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay, so if you go to a roller rink, it's this big area where everyone can roller blade or roller skate.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's right.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And what about the next word?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A block.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Block.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A block.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay, so this is a noun.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
A block.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And a block is a part of a city that is surrounded by four streets.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Okay, so a city is made up of many blocks and everyone lives on a block.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Exactly, so it's a square within the city.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Alright, very good.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So these are the two words that we previewed and we're going to listen to them now in the dialogue.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We're going to hear two guys just talking about normal everyday things, but we're going to be listening to them in 1970.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hey man, how's it hanging?

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey man, everything is just groovy, baby.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I heard it was far out, man.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Right on, right on.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Gravy!

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, man.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm starving.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, groovy dialogue.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, really nice, huh?

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right, so some interesting language in here.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Like we said, it sounds a bit strange, but a lot of this is still used today in modern English.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So why don't we look at some of these words in Language Takeaway?

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we have the first word, far out.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Far out.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That was far out.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
To be far out.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay, so it's just another way of saying cool.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Cool.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That was nice.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It was really cool.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So they went to the roller rink.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It was far out.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It was really cool, but the other guy couldn't go because he saw a foxy lady.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A foxy lady.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, foxy lady.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So basically a foxy lady is a really good looking or sexy woman.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Right, commonly you would hear some men refer to an attractive woman as a fox.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay, so foxy lady.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now Marco, can we say a foxy man?

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No, this is a phrase that you would only use for women.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, so foxy lady.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Foxy lady.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So after he met up with the foxy lady, they both just decided to mellow out at her place.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
To mellow out.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
To mellow out.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, so mellow out.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What does this mean exactly?

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Basically just to relax.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, so to relax, to take it easy.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
To mellow out.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So what did you do on the weekend?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, nothing.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I just stayed at home and mellowed out.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Alright, and so the response to that was?

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Right on.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right on.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Right on.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Right on.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Right on.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And so basically they're saying, okay, good, I agree.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, this phrase, you can say as good, yeah that's nice, or you can also say it as well, correct, correct, I agree.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So why don't we listen to some examples of how we can use this word in other situations.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Example one.

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right on.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You got a high score.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's amazing.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Example two.

104
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You got the job?

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Right on.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Example three.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Jenny was right when she told me she thought Rick was no good for me.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I should have listened to her.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay, so I think that's pretty clear.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We can see how it means, correct, or also, okay, good.

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Alright, right on.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And now we also have another word that's similar to far out.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He said gravy.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Gravy.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Gravy.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Gravy.

117
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now, if you look it up in a dictionary, it's going to tell you something else, right?

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Gravy is a sauce you put on meat.

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But in this case, we say gravy is cool.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's nice.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yep.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Alright, so gravy.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That was gravy.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Now, finally, at the end of their conversation, they said, wanna book.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, let's book.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Book.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, to book, that is a verb.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah, interesting verb.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It basically means to leave a place quickly.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, so we have to book.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The police are coming.

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Right.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Or, I got a book, guys.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm late.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, book.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
To leave quickly.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
To leave suddenly.

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yep.

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And that word is used quite commonly today, isn't it?

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's used among, like, younger people.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So, you would say, yeah, let's book.

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This party is dead.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay, great.

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So, there's a lot of pretty cool phrases in this dialogue.

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Pretty groovy phrases.

148
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why don't we hear them again in context?

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hey, man.

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How's it hangin'?

151
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everything is just groovy, baby.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I heard it was far out, man.

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was chatting her up a bit, and then we mellowed out at her place.

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right on, right on.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry, and he said it was dinomite.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Gravy!

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jim is such a chive turkey, man.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

163
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah, man.

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm starving.

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Alright, so now that we understand these six words that we saw in Language Takeaway, it's time for us now to take a look at some great phrases that we can use today in Fluency Builder.

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, so at the start of the conversation, there was an interesting way he started talking to his friend, right?

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Alright, he said, how's it hangin'?

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How's it hangin'?

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How's it hangin'?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, so basically, how is it going?

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How's it going?

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How are you?

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Now, you notice in the spelling that we do have a G at the end, I-N-G, right?

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, but usually you don't really pronounce the G in this context, because it's very informal.

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So how's it hangin'?

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How's it hangin'?

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So he said everything was just groovy, and then he started telling him about how he met a girl, and he chat her up a bit.

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
To chat her up.

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, so to chat somebody up.

181
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So when you chat someone up, you talk with them, right?

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, you're making conversation.

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But it's more than just conversation, isn't it?

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, you're trying to be a little bit flirty and maybe say nice romantic phrases or something like that.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, so usually it's between a woman and a man, right?

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And it's the man who chats up the woman.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So a little bit of a sexist phrase here.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
To chat someone up, or to chat up a girl, right?

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay, so he was chatting her up.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's right.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so they were talking about how Jim went to the roller rink, but he didn't have any money, right?

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Because Jim is always hitting his friends up for cash.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, so to hit someone up.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
To hit someone up.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So before we explain this word, let's listen to some other examples so then we can maybe understand the meaning.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Example one.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can you believe Patrick?

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Patrick, he came up to me a month ago and tried to hit me up for some money.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Example two.

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I was a kid, I used to always hit my dad up for lunch money.

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Example three.

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This is the last time I lend you money.

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't even try to hit me up for more.

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, so when you hit someone up for something, you ask for it.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So usually it's to ask for money.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's right.

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, so to hit someone up.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And now for our last phrase.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's book and let's go grab some grub.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
To grab some grub.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Grab some grub.

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, let's break this one down.

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
With the final word, grub, what are we talking about?

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Grub is an informal way of saying food.

216
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay, so to grab some grub is to get some food quickly.

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, let's go get some food.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
All right, so maybe it's time for us to grab some grub.

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And while we're doing that, you can listen to the dialogue one last time.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey, man, how's it hanging?

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hey, man, everything is just groovy, baby.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Did you go to the roller rink on Saturday?

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I heard it was far out, man.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I wanted to, but I ran into this foxy lady that just moved to my block.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was chatting her up a bit and then we mellowed out at her place.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Right on, right on.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dynamite.

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Gravy!

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Jim is such a jive turkey, man.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He's always hitting me up for cash.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Anyway, you want to book and go grab some grub?

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yeah, man, I'm starving.

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:15,000
All right, so some interesting phrases, and even though some of these words you may not really commonly hear anymore, they might still be used in movies or something that's related to the disco era because it's very, very popular still, right?

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, that's right.

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Some of our more advanced users could even use a lot of these phrases in a kind of funny way to reference back to 1970.

237
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, exactly.

238
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So it's fun and, well, you will use them or you will hear them from time to time, even today.
