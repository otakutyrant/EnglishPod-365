00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:32,619
EnglishPod.com And, well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,060
What?

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:33,880
Why?

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,920
I mean, we've had our ups and downs, and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,100
That's just it.

6
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,119
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,039
It's not you, it's me.

8
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,140
I know that I can be hard to deal with, and you're a great guy.

9
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,259
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,060
So, what are you saying?

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,000
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,399
Tim, you are too good for me.

13
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:05,180
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

14
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:08,560
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,180
I know I'd only hurt you.

16
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,180
I know I'd only make you cry.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,280
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,200
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

19
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:18,180
Just give me another chance.

20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,200
I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick together.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,599
Don't leave me.

22
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,219
I can't, Tim.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,799
I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.

24
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,859
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

25
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,280
Laura.

26
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:37,799
Here are your keys.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,980
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

28
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,140
I'm sorry, Tim.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,159
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

30
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,079
I'll always love you.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,060
Goodbye.

32
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,939
Make you cry.

33
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,060
I'm not the one you need.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,480
I love you.

35
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:05,700
Goodbye.
