00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another show with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're bringing you another romantic lesson, but a little bit sad as well.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, unfortunately, our couple is going to be breaking up.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So it's a little bit sad today, but it's going to be good because we're going to be teaching you some great words and phrases that you can use when you are faced in this situation.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And so we're going to learn some phrases for breaking up and also some phrases for staying together.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and see what happens with our young couple.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Wish I could be the one, the one who could give you love.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Honey, do you have a second?

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sure.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you okay?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You seem a bit worried.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What's on your mind?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We need to talk.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Why?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's just it.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's not you.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's me.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I know that I can be hard to deal with and you're a great guy.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So what are you saying?

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Tim, you are too good for me.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know I'd only hurt you.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know I'd only make you cry.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Just give me another chance.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't leave me.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't, Tim.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Laura.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Here are your keys.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry, Tim.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll always love you.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Goodbye.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, so a pretty sad ending to this relationship, isn't it?

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, but I don't think the girl was very moved or very sad by breaking up with him.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I wonder why.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Maybe she's got some other boyfriend somewhere else.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Maybe.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, as you mentioned, we listened to some great phrases, and it's time for us to take a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Fluency Builder.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, here we're going to focus on phrases that people use when they break up.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So maybe you've heard these in movies, and we're going to look at the meaning now.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
All right, our first phrase, as we heard, she started by saying, we need to talk.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We need to talk.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right, so it's a very direct sentence, we need to talk.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So when you tell someone, we need to talk, you're telling them that you want to talk about a serious thing, right?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Right, so if somebody tells you, we need to talk, you know that you're going to talk about a very serious matter.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, a problem or a breakup or something.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And after that, she told him that they should start seeing other people.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Start seeing other people.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, I think we need to start seeing other people.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
To see other people.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
All right, so this is very easy to understand.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It means to?

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
To date other people.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, so it basically means that you will break up.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's an indirect way of saying that, right?

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, you're not saying, hey, let's stop dating.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're saying, oh, well, maybe we should date other people and kind of giving the idea that you will still date each other, but everyone knows you won't.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
All right, so let's start seeing other people.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now for our third phrase.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She says, it's not you, it's me.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's not you, it's me.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not you, it's me.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now this is a very cliche phrase and you hear it all the time in movies and well, some people still use it, right?

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everyone says this.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've heard this.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I've said this.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It means basically, I'm the problem.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're not the problem.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm the problem.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Right, so I am breaking up with you because it's my fault, not your fault.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So it's kind of a nice way to break up with someone, but actually everyone knows that it's kind of a lie.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Not true, right?

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It is you.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are the problem.

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
All right, so it's not you, it's me.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And then, well, in order to emphasize this, that it's not his fault, she said that I know I'm hard to deal with.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So hard to deal with.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, if somebody is hard to deal with.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
They're maybe difficult to talk to, difficult to please, maybe difficult to manage.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, so it's very difficult to talk to that person.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
All right, hard to deal with.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's only for people.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can't use it for a situation or something else?

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, you can use it for people or situations or even sometimes things.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So for example, I can say, I find this problem at work so hard to deal with.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, hard to deal with.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So we've seen these four phrases that we can use to break up with someone.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And well, let's listen to our dialogue again.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some other phrases to stay together with someone.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
anymore, Tim.

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not you.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's me.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I know that I can be hard to deal with.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And you're a great guy.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So what are you saying?

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Tim, you are too good for me.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know I'd only hurt you.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I know I'd only make you cry.

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Just give me another chance.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't leave me.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't, Tim.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm only doing this for you.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Laura.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Here are your keys.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry, Tim.

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I wish you all the best and I hope that one day we can meet again.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll always love you.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Goodbye.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
OK, so as you said, we're now going to focus on the phrases you use to stay in a relationship with someone.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder, part two.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Fluency Builder.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So the girl was trying to break up with him and he kept on trying to convince her to stay.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's right.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And one of the things he said was, we've had our ups and downs.

147
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We've had our ups and downs.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ups and downs.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, ups and downs are good times and bad times.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right, so the good times would be the ups and the bad times.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Obviously, the downs.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
All right, so it's an informal way of saying good times, bad times.

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So they've had their ups and downs and he said, we can work it out.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We can work it out.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So whatever the problem is, we can work it out.

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So why don't we hear some examples of how this phrase is used and that will help us understand it a bit better.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Example one.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Peter and Claudia were having some problems, but they finally worked out their personal differences.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Example two.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We need to work out a new marketing plan for this upcoming quarter.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Example three.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
After an hour, I finally worked out the answer to this math problem.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay, so to work something out means to find a solution for it.

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, to solve the problem.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
To solve the problem.

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And again, he kept on insisting and saying, well, we can get through this.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We can get through this.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay, get through this.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So to get through something.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What does it mean to get through something?

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, basically to survive a difficult situation.

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or live through a difficult time.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, so for them, the difficult time was this in their relationship.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, or maybe you're having a problem at work and you might say, hey guys, don't worry, we can get through this.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Just give us one more week.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay, very good.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And well, as he was saying that they can get through this, he mentioned that they have to stick together.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
To stick together.

180
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We got to stick together.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Stick together.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So again, to stick.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So when something sticks together, it stays together like glue.

184
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Right, so they have to be a team and not separate in order to solve their problems.

185
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Exactly, it gives you the idea that they're going to work together and stay together.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okay, very good.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So let's stick it together.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
All right, so again, we have four great phrases to convince somebody or to say that you want to stay together in a relationship, right?

189
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's right.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So I think it'll help us to understand these if we hear them one more time in the dialogue.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Honey, do you have a second?

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Sure.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Are you okay?

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You seem a bit worried.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What's on your mind?

196
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We need to talk.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why?

201
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's just it.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's not you.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's me.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I know that I can be hard to deal with.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And you're a great guy.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So what are you saying?

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Tim, you are too good for me.

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

213
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know I'd only hurt you.

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I know I'd only make you cry.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just give me another chance.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't leave me.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't, Tim.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm only doing this for you.

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

225
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Laura.

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Here are your keys.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry, Tim.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll always love you.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Goodbye.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I know I'd only make you cry.

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm not the one you're being.

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I love you goodbye.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
All right, so breaking up can be a difficult situation, especially if you're the one breaking up, right?

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Well, I guess it's never happy if you're the person who's being broken up with or you're the person doing the breaking up.

237
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But you know what?

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I really noticed that a lot of the phrases the girl used to break up were very cliche, like you said.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They were very- Too common.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Mm-hmm.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
And kind of a joke, almost.

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So the phrase, it's not you, it's me, it's one of them.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yep.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And she also said, you deserve better.

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You deserve someone better.

246
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yeah.

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's a very common one, saying like, I'm not good enough for you.

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, but again, it kind of just loses its meaning, doesn't it?

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And also another phrase that's very cliche, but it wasn't in her dialogue, was maybe the timing is just not right.

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, people say that all the time.

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, so they say, no, the timing is not right.

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not the appropriate time to be together.

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah, that's just an excuse for not wanting to date that special person.

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Exactly.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So it can be a difficult situation, and people do it every day through letters.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yep.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Sometimes through the phone.

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yep.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
In this case, they were breaking up in person.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So listeners, why don't you tell us if you have any stories of breaking up with someone, or maybe somebody broke up with you.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's right.

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
