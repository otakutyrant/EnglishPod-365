00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,179
Hello English learners, welcome back to another show with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,179 --> 00:00:07,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:08,859
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're bringing you another romantic lesson, but a little bit sad as well.

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,939
That's right.

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,219
Today, unfortunately, our couple is going to be breaking up.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:20,559
Right.

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:29,300
So it's a little bit sad today, but it's going to be good because we're going to be teaching you some great words and phrases that you can use when you are faced in this situation.

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:29,960
That's right.

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:36,700
And so we're going to learn some phrases for breaking up and also some phrases for staying together.

11
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:37,560
All right.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,899
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and see what happens with our young couple.

13
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:53,420
Wish I could be the one, the one who could give you love.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,000
Honey, do you have a second?

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,799
Sure.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,780
Are you okay?

17
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,979
You seem a bit worried.

18
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:04,840
What's on your mind?

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,420
We need to talk.

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,400
Okay.

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,959
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

22
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:14,420
What?

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,219
Why?

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,260
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

25
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:21,439
That's just it.

26
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,480
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

27
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,840
It's not you.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,420
It's me.

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,500
I know that I can be hard to deal with and you're a great guy.

30
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,680
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,420
So what are you saying?

32
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,359
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,760
Tim, you are too good for me.

34
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,540
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

35
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,900
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,540
I know I'd only hurt you.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,540
I know I'd only make you cry.

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,640
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,560
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,540
Just give me another chance.

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,540
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

42
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,920
Don't leave me.

43
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,579
I can't, Tim.

44
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,139
I hope someday you can find some way to understand I'm only doing this for you.

45
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:17,180
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

46
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,639
Laura.

47
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,159
Here are your keys.

48
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,319
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

49
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,460
I'm sorry, Tim.

50
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,500
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

51
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,439
I'll always love you.

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,419
Goodbye.

53
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:56,439
Okay, so a pretty sad ending to this relationship, isn't it?

54
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,939
Yeah, but I don't think the girl was very moved or very sad by breaking up with him.

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,960
I wonder why.

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,599
Maybe she's got some other boyfriend somewhere else.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,240
Maybe.

58
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,539
Well, as you mentioned, we listened to some great phrases, and it's time for us to take a look at them now in Fluency Builder.

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,800
Fluency Builder.

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,580
Okay, here we're going to focus on phrases that people use when they break up.

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,599
So maybe you've heard these in movies, and we're going to look at the meaning now.

62
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:32,240
All right, our first phrase, as we heard, she started by saying, we need to talk.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,259
We need to talk.

64
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,419
All right, so it's a very direct sentence, we need to talk.

65
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:45,860
So when you tell someone, we need to talk, you're telling them that you want to talk about a serious thing, right?

66
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:53,319
Right, so if somebody tells you, we need to talk, you know that you're going to talk about a very serious matter.

67
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,580
Yeah, a problem or a breakup or something.

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,180
And after that, she told him that they should start seeing other people.

69
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,460
Start seeing other people.

70
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay, I think we need to start seeing other people.

71
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,879
To see other people.

72
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:11,360
All right, so this is very easy to understand.

73
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,939
It means to?

74
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,120
To date other people.

75
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,259
Okay, so it basically means that you will break up.

76
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:19,759
It's an indirect way of saying that, right?

77
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,660
Yeah, you're not saying, hey, let's stop dating.

78
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:32,899
You're saying, oh, well, maybe we should date other people and kind of giving the idea that you will still date each other, but everyone knows you won't.

79
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,560
All right, so let's start seeing other people.

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,060
Now for our third phrase.

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,540
She says, it's not you, it's me.

82
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,300
It's not you, it's me.

83
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,480
It's not you, it's me.

84
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:52,819
Now this is a very cliche phrase and you hear it all the time in movies and well, some people still use it, right?

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,339
Everyone says this.

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,319
I've heard this.

87
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,379
I've said this.

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:56,939
Okay.

89
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,459
It means basically, I'm the problem.

90
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,839
You're not the problem.

91
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,759
I'm the problem.

92
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:06,339
Right, so I am breaking up with you because it's my fault, not your fault.

93
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:14,459
So it's kind of a nice way to break up with someone, but actually everyone knows that it's kind of a lie.

94
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:15,319
Not true, right?

95
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,199
It is you.

96
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,079
You are the problem.

97
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,819
All right, so it's not you, it's me.

98
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,420
And then, well, in order to emphasize this, that it's not his fault, she said that I know I'm hard to deal with.

99
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,879
So hard to deal with.

100
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay, if somebody is hard to deal with.

101
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,500
They're maybe difficult to talk to, difficult to please, maybe difficult to manage.

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,420
Okay, so it's very difficult to talk to that person.

103
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,699
All right, hard to deal with.

104
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,720
It's only for people.

105
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,180
You can't use it for a situation or something else?

106
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,540
No, you can use it for people or situations or even sometimes things.

107
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:58,620
So for example, I can say, I find this problem at work so hard to deal with.

108
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,420
Okay, hard to deal with.

109
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,779
So we've seen these four phrases that we can use to break up with someone.

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,720
And well, let's listen to our dialogue again.

111
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,720
We're going to slow it down a little bit, and then we'll come back and look at some other phrases to stay together with someone.

112
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,199
anymore, Tim.

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,699
It's not you.

114
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,279
It's me.

115
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,879
I know that I can be hard to deal with.

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,339
And you're a great guy.

117
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,579
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

118
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,319
So what are you saying?

119
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:56,199
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

120
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,639
Tim, you are too good for me.

121
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:05,399
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

122
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,779
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

123
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:10,439
I know I'd only hurt you.

124
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,480
I know I'd only make you cry.

125
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,240
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

126
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,420
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

127
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,399
Just give me another chance.

128
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,420
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

129
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,800
Don't leave me.

130
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,439
I can't, Tim.

131
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,420
I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

132
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,019
I'm only doing this for you.

133
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,060
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

134
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,500
Laura.

135
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,019
Here are your keys.

136
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,220
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,360
I'm sorry, Tim.

138
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,399
I wish you all the best and I hope that one day we can meet again.

139
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,300
I'll always love you.

140
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:49,319
Goodbye.

141
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,879
OK, so as you said, we're now going to focus on the phrases you use to stay in a relationship with someone.

142
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,019
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder, part two.

143
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,980
Fluency Builder.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,879
So the girl was trying to break up with him and he kept on trying to convince her to stay.

145
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:13,399
That's right.

146
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,939
And one of the things he said was, we've had our ups and downs.

147
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,699
We've had our ups and downs.

148
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,160
Ups and downs.

149
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:25,240
Well, ups and downs are good times and bad times.

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,680
Right, so the good times would be the ups and the bad times.

151
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,759
Obviously, the downs.

152
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,840
All right, so it's an informal way of saying good times, bad times.

153
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,379
So they've had their ups and downs and he said, we can work it out.

154
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,519
We can work it out.

155
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,919
So whatever the problem is, we can work it out.

156
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,120
So why don't we hear some examples of how this phrase is used and that will help us understand it a bit better.

157
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:50,960
Example one.

158
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:57,179
Peter and Claudia were having some problems, but they finally worked out their personal differences.

159
00:08:58,899 --> 00:08:59,840
Example two.

160
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,940
We need to work out a new marketing plan for this upcoming quarter.

161
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,259
Example three.

162
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,220
After an hour, I finally worked out the answer to this math problem.

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
Okay, so to work something out means to find a solution for it.

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah, to solve the problem.

165
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,240
To solve the problem.

166
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,059
And again, he kept on insisting and saying, well, we can get through this.

167
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,980
We can get through this.

168
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,919
Okay, get through this.

169
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,679
So to get through something.

170
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,980
What does it mean to get through something?

171
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,100
Well, basically to survive a difficult situation.

172
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,879
All right.

173
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,740
Or live through a difficult time.

174
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,840
Okay, so for them, the difficult time was this in their relationship.

175
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,440
Yeah, or maybe you're having a problem at work and you might say, hey guys, don't worry, we can get through this.

176
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,960
Just give us one more week.

177
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,480
Okay, very good.

178
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,539
And well, as he was saying that they can get through this, he mentioned that they have to stick together.

179
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,039
To stick together.

180
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,919
We got to stick together.

181
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:06,759
Stick together.

182
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,039
So again, to stick.

183
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,100
So when something sticks together, it stays together like glue.

184
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:18,720
Right, so they have to be a team and not separate in order to solve their problems.

185
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,919
Exactly, it gives you the idea that they're going to work together and stay together.

186
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,240
Okay, very good.

187
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,639
So let's stick it together.

188
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,980
All right, so again, we have four great phrases to convince somebody or to say that you want to stay together in a relationship, right?

189
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:35,639
That's right.

190
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,480
So I think it'll help us to understand these if we hear them one more time in the dialogue.

191
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,919
Honey, do you have a second?

192
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:58,720
Sure.

193
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,700
Are you okay?

194
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,919
You seem a bit worried.

195
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:03,799
What's on your mind?

196
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,360
We need to talk.

197
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,379
Okay.

198
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,879
I've been thinking and well, I think we need to start seeing other people.

199
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,379
What?

200
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,159
Why?

201
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,240
I mean, we've had our ups and downs and we have the occasional disagreement, but we're happy together, aren't we?

202
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,360
That's just it.

203
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,419
I'm not happy anymore, Tim.

204
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,779
It's not you.

205
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:24,379
It's me.

206
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,940
I know that I can be hard to deal with.

207
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,419
And you're a great guy.

208
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,639
You're the type of guy that any woman would kill for.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,360
So what are you saying?

210
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,299
You're breaking up with me because I'm perfect?

211
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,679
Tim, you are too good for me.

212
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,480
You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy.

213
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,840
I could say that I'll be all you need, but that'd be a lie.

214
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,480
I know I'd only hurt you.

215
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,500
I know I'd only make you cry.

216
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,580
Baby, come on, don't do this to me.

217
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,500
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

218
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,480
Just give me another chance.

219
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,480
I know that we can get through this, but we got to stick together.

220
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,860
Don't leave me.

221
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,519
I can't, Tim.

222
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,480
I hope someday you can find some way to understand.

223
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm only doing this for you.

224
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,100
I don't really want to go, but deep in my heart, I know this is the kindest thing to do.

225
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:16,559
Laura.

226
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,100
Here are your keys.

227
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,279
I'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week.

228
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,399
I'm sorry, Tim.

229
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,460
I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again.

230
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,379
I'll always love you.

231
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:29,360
Goodbye.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,039
I know I'd only make you cry.

233
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:39,519
I'm not the one you're being.

234
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,960
I love you goodbye.

235
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,980
All right, so breaking up can be a difficult situation, especially if you're the one breaking up, right?

236
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,120
Well, I guess it's never happy if you're the person who's being broken up with or you're the person doing the breaking up.

237
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,940
But you know what?

238
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:13,539
I really noticed that a lot of the phrases the girl used to break up were very cliche, like you said.

239
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,759
They were very- Too common.

240
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,279
Mm-hmm.

241
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:17,679
And kind of a joke, almost.

242
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,299
So the phrase, it's not you, it's me, it's one of them.

243
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:20,600
Yep.

244
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,840
And she also said, you deserve better.

245
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,600
You deserve someone better.

246
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,100
Yeah.

247
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,080
That's a very common one, saying like, I'm not good enough for you.

248
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,360
Yeah, but again, it kind of just loses its meaning, doesn't it?

249
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,700
And also another phrase that's very cliche, but it wasn't in her dialogue, was maybe the timing is just not right.

250
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:39,519
Yeah, people say that all the time.

251
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,460
Yeah, so they say, no, the timing is not right.

252
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,039
It's not the appropriate time to be together.

253
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,820
Yeah, that's just an excuse for not wanting to date that special person.

254
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:49,759
Exactly.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,179
So it can be a difficult situation, and people do it every day through letters.

256
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,500
Yep.

257
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,679
Sometimes through the phone.

258
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,139
Yep.

259
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:57,919
In this case, they were breaking up in person.

260
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,159
So listeners, why don't you tell us if you have any stories of breaking up with someone, or maybe somebody broke up with you.

261
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:04,919
That's right.

262
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:12,419
