EnglishPod.com Excuse me, is this where I register?

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,679
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,179
Yes, of course.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,399
I need your student ID, please.

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:18,699
Here you are.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,480
Okay, Susan.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,300
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,640
Is this information correct?

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,839
Yes, I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,299
Sure, that's not a problem.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,100
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, here's my list.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,920
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

14
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:43,159
Yeah, that's perfect.

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,240
What about the subjects for your minor?

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,100
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,579
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,759
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,780
Okay, here you go.

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,159
You're registered now.

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,979
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.
