00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com Excuse me, is this where I register?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes, of course.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I need your student ID, please.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here you are.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, Susan.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is this information correct?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes, I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sure, that's not a problem.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, here's my list.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yeah, that's perfect.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What about the subjects for your minor?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Okay, here you go.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're registered now.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.
