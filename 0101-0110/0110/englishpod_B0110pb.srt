00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:06,839
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:08,039
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,359
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:14,099
And today we have a lesson for all our university students out there.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,880
That's right.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,480
We're talking about registering for university.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:32,299
Okay, so it's a difficult process sometimes, even in your own language, so we're going to try and make it a little bit easier by giving you some of the common words you would need to register at a university.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,600
All right, well, I think it's time we get started by listening to the dialogue.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,299
And we're going to listen to a young female student as she tries to choose her classes.

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,600
Excuse me, is this where I register?

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,119
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Yes, of course.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,820
I need your student ID, please.

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,119
Here you are.

15
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:04,920
Okay, Susan.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,719
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

17
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,079
Is this information correct?

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,260
Um, I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

20
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,739
Sure, that's not a problem.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,519
Do you have the list of courses that you want to take this semester?

22
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,459
Yeah, here's my list.

23
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:26,319
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.

24
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,620
Yeah, that's perfect.

25
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:29,680
What about the subjects for your minor?

26
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,540
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

27
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:37,019
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

28
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:39,180
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,219
Okay, here you go.

30
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:45,599
You're registered now.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,519
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,579
All right, great.

33
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:58,340
A very good student taking a lot of classes this semester.

34
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,879
I know, and it sounds like some of them are pretty hard as well.

35
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:02,819
Yeah, they are.

36
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:13,120
Well, she used some of those very common phrases that we would need when we are registering at university, so let's take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
Language Takeaway.

38
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,180
Okay, so the first thing, I think we need to deal with this word to register.

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,759
Mm-hmm, register.

40
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,719
So register for university.

41
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:35,080
Okay, so we've mentioned this word many times, so I think it would be a good idea to listen to some examples, and then we'll come back and explain it.

42
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,599
Example one.

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,120
I registered to attend the conference on international trade this month.

44
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,379
Example two.

45
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,400
It is your obligation as a good citizen to register to vote.

46
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,139
Example three.

47
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,919
It is necessary to register on our website before joining the conference.

48
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,439
So when you register for something, you put your name down on a list, right?

49
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,780
So in this case, when you register for university, you officially put your name on the list of students in that course.

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,680
Okay, so you can register for university.

51
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,599
What else can you register for?

52
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,219
Register for a class.

53
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,039
You can even register to vote.

54
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,180
Okay, so register.

55
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:36,280
Now, she was registering for her classes, and we saw these words that we know already, but it's a good idea to take a look at them.

56
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,580
We heard that she is a business major.

57
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,000
So a major.

58
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,400
A major.

59
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,460
A business major.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,300
And what is your major?

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,379
The major is the major area that you study, the most important area that you study.

62
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,199
The area where you are specialized.

63
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,139
The area that you focus on.

64
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,580
Okay, now we heard another one that's called a minor.

65
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,419
So this is another area that you study, but it is less important than your major.

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,900
Okay, so major and your minor.

67
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,199
So let's give an example.

68
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,500
Imagine you must take 100 classes to graduate from university.

69
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:21,480
Maybe you have to take 50 for your major and maybe 30 for your minor.

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay, very good.

71
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,019
And now on your degree, on your title, does it say what is your major and minor?

72
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,339
Well, I think it depends on the university, but in my case, yes.

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,519
Okay, very good.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,160
So major and minor.

75
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:43,120
Now related to this and what you were saying about your classes, it takes us to our next word, which is credits.

76
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,079
Credits.

77
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,759
Now this is easily confused with classes sometimes.

78
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:51,420
That's right.

79
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, a credit is kind of a point.

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,740
So like maybe, so in university you need a certain number of credits or points to graduate.

81
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,319
Okay, so suppose you need 100 credits to graduate.

82
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:15,579
So that's not 100 courses because each course might be worth four or six or eight credits depending on how important it is.

83
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,220
Very good.

84
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:20,379
So maybe the classes that are part of your major will have more credits.

85
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,620
All right, very good.

86
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,100
And now we have our last word in this dialogue and it was tuition.

87
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,139
She had to pay her tuition.

88
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,879
So tuition is the money that you must pay for education.

89
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,759
Okay, only for education.

90
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,240
That's right.

91
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:43,360
So university tuition, private school tuition, or even language course tuition.

92
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,560
Okay, so a tuition is the money you must pay for school only.

93
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,480
So we've seen a lot of great words used for registering at university.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,699
So I think it's time to listen to the dialogue for the second time a little bit slower, and then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

95
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:08,220
Excuse me, is this where I register?

96
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,199
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

97
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,139
Yes, of course.

98
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:15,579
I need your student ID, please.

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,759
Here you are.

100
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,740
Okay, Susan, it says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

101
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,079
Is this information correct?

102
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,319
Yes.

103
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,899
Um, I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

104
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,660
Sure, that's not a problem.

105
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,759
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Yeah, here's my list.

107
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

108
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,439
Yeah, that's perfect.

109
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,519
What about the subjects for your minor?

110
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,600
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

111
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,060
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,240
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

113
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,120
Okay, here you go.

114
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,500
You're registered now.

115
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,339
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

116
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,220
All right, so it's time for putting it together.

117
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,480
Putting it together.

118
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:15,759
And we're going to look at some phrases here that we can use to talk about education and university and we can use them in different ways.

119
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,139
All right, and our first phrase is actually very similar to register.

120
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,819
To sign up for something.

121
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay, I want to sign up for.

122
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,540
I'd like to sign up for my courses.

123
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,620
I think it would be a good idea if we listen to some examples of how we can use this phrase.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,519
Example one.

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,120
I signed up for a one-year gym membership.

126
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,060
Example two.

127
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,779
If you want to assist our meeting, you need to sign up first.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
Example three.

129
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,540
I hate signing up for things online because they just send you spam emails.

130
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:03,699
Okay, so I can see that to sign up for something is to agree to take part in it.

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,759
Okay, so it's a little bit more informal than register.

132
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:07,459
Yeah, exactly.

133
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:08,319
Less formal.

134
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,199
All right.

135
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,839
So moving on to our second phrase.

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,079
This is very important because it's often used improperly, right?

137
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,220
Yeah, people often make mistakes with this phrase.

138
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,839
All right, so let's look at this phrase second year.

139
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,579
So she is in her second year.

140
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:30,220
Now it seems very simple, so why are we explaining this?

141
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:34,039
Well, it often gets confused with grade.

142
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,000
So when we talk about university, we talk about first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

143
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,120
We cannot say grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four.

144
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,980
Or year one, year two.

145
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,700
No, it's always first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

146
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:49,840
Okay, very good.

147
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,799
Or last year.

148
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,600
Yeah, last year.

149
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,059
My last year of college.

150
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,700
Exactly.

151
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:54,679
Very good.

152
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,059
So now you know how you can explain to someone what year of college or university you're in.

153
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:01,019
Yes, that's right.

154
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:01,860
Very good.

155
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:07,059
And we have one more phrase to you, and it was when she was getting her class schedule.

156
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,059
So class schedule.

157
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,759
Class schedule.

158
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,940
Now a schedule is the list of things you do at what time.

159
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,220
Right, so it's the timetable of your day or your week.

160
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:20,720
Yep.

161
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,360
All right.

162
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,480
And your class schedule will say all the classes that you have and what time they're at.

163
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,940
So what other types of schedules can we have?

164
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:32,279
You also have maybe a gym schedule.

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:32,879
That's right.

166
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,759
Or even a work schedule.

167
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:35,580
Right.

168
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,019
So we have different types of schedules, and you can use it depending on what you are doing.

169
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:43,379
Those are all the phrases we have for putting it together today.

170
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,799
And now let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back.

171
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,320
Excuse me.

172
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,480
Is this where I register?

173
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,980
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

174
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,480
Yes, of course.

175
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,700
I need your student ID, please.

176
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,840
Here you are.

177
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,820
Okay, Susan.

178
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,600
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

179
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,940
Is this information correct?

180
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:15,860
Yes.

181
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,159
I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

182
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:20,799
Sure.

183
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,600
That's not a problem.

184
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,399
Do you have the list of courses that you want to take this semester?

185
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:25,360
Yeah.

186
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,320
Here's my list.

187
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

188
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,460
Yeah, that's perfect.

189
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,559
What about the subjects for your minor?

190
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,419
Oh, yeah.

191
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,419
I almost forgot.

192
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,899
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

193
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,059
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

194
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,139
Okay, here you go.

195
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,480
You're registered now.

196
00:10:49,659 --> 00:10:52,740
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

197
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,960
All right, so we were talking about second year, first year, third year, et cetera.

198
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:03,179
Yeah.

199
00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:09,580
Now, there are also other names that we give to each year, both for high school and university.

200
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,059
I think this is only for America, like in the United States.

201
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:18,120
We don't do this in Canada, and I always get so confused.

202
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,679
So, Marco, what is the name you give to first year students?

203
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,799
Okay, so first year students are called freshmen.

204
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,940
Okay, because they're fresh.

205
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,059
Because they're fresh, yeah.

206
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,340
They just came from middle school.

207
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,460
They just came from high school.

208
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,179
All right, and what about the second year students?

209
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,740
They're called sophomores.

210
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,559
Okay, because they're soft?

211
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,700
Well, it's not soft.

212
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,700
It's sophomore, like S-O-P-H.

213
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,539
Sophomore.

214
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,200
Sophomore.

215
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,179
And then third year students are called juniors.

216
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,480
Okay, because they're almost the junior manager.

217
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,139
Exactly.

218
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,100
Because then last year students are called seniors.

219
00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:56,100
So, they're the oldest guys in the school.

220
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:56,840
Exactly.

221
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,460
So you can say, yeah, I'm a sophomore at Arizona State University.

222
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,080
Okay, so we only use this in America, though, right?

223
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:09,379
Yes, yes, it's very, and not only for university, but also for high school.

224
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,120
Okay.

225
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,700
All right, guys, that's all the time we have for today.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:24,480
I hope you enjoyed this lesson, and if you have any questions or comments, or you want to share with us your experiences in high school or university, please come to the website at EnglishPod.com.

227
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:25,179
That's right.

228
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,179
So, Marco and I are there to answer your questions, and until next time, thanks for listening, and goodbye.
