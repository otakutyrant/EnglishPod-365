00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we have a lesson for all our university students out there.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're talking about registering for university.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, so it's a difficult process sometimes, even in your own language, so we're going to try and make it a little bit easier by giving you some of the common words you would need to register at a university.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right, well, I think it's time we get started by listening to the dialogue.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And we're going to listen to a young female student as she tries to choose her classes.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Excuse me, is this where I register?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, of course.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I need your student ID, please.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here you are.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, Susan.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is this information correct?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Um, I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sure, that's not a problem.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Do you have the list of courses that you want to take this semester?

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, here's my list.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, that's perfect.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What about the subjects for your minor?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, here you go.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You're registered now.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
All right, great.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
A very good student taking a lot of classes this semester.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know, and it sounds like some of them are pretty hard as well.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, they are.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, she used some of those very common phrases that we would need when we are registering at university, so let's take a look at them now in Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Language Takeaway.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, so the first thing, I think we need to deal with this word to register.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Mm-hmm, register.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So register for university.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, so we've mentioned this word many times, so I think it would be a good idea to listen to some examples, and then we'll come back and explain it.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Example one.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I registered to attend the conference on international trade this month.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Example two.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It is your obligation as a good citizen to register to vote.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Example three.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It is necessary to register on our website before joining the conference.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So when you register for something, you put your name down on a list, right?

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So in this case, when you register for university, you officially put your name on the list of students in that course.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, so you can register for university.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What else can you register for?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Register for a class.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can even register to vote.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, so register.

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, she was registering for her classes, and we saw these words that we know already, but it's a good idea to take a look at them.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We heard that she is a business major.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So a major.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A major.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A business major.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And what is your major?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The major is the major area that you study, the most important area that you study.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The area where you are specialized.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The area that you focus on.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay, now we heard another one that's called a minor.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So this is another area that you study, but it is less important than your major.

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, so major and your minor.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So let's give an example.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Imagine you must take 100 classes to graduate from university.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Maybe you have to take 50 for your major and maybe 30 for your minor.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, very good.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And now on your degree, on your title, does it say what is your major and minor?

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Well, I think it depends on the university, but in my case, yes.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay, very good.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So major and minor.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Now related to this and what you were saying about your classes, it takes us to our next word, which is credits.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Credits.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now this is easily confused with classes sometimes.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, a credit is kind of a point.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So like maybe, so in university you need a certain number of credits or points to graduate.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, so suppose you need 100 credits to graduate.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So that's not 100 courses because each course might be worth four or six or eight credits depending on how important it is.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Very good.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So maybe the classes that are part of your major will have more credits.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All right, very good.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And now we have our last word in this dialogue and it was tuition.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
She had to pay her tuition.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So tuition is the money that you must pay for education.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, only for education.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So university tuition, private school tuition, or even language course tuition.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay, so a tuition is the money you must pay for school only.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So we've seen a lot of great words used for registering at university.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So I think it's time to listen to the dialogue for the second time a little bit slower, and then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Excuse me, is this where I register?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes, of course.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I need your student ID, please.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Here you are.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, Susan, it says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Is this information correct?

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Um, I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sure, that's not a problem.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you have a list of courses that you want to take this semester?

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, here's my list.

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, that's perfect.

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What about the subjects for your minor?

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh yeah, I almost forgot.

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, here you go.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You're registered now.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
All right, so it's time for putting it together.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Putting it together.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And we're going to look at some phrases here that we can use to talk about education and university and we can use them in different ways.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
All right, and our first phrase is actually very similar to register.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To sign up for something.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, I want to sign up for.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'd like to sign up for my courses.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think it would be a good idea if we listen to some examples of how we can use this phrase.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Example one.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I signed up for a one-year gym membership.

126
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Example two.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you want to assist our meeting, you need to sign up first.

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Example three.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I hate signing up for things online because they just send you spam emails.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay, so I can see that to sign up for something is to agree to take part in it.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, so it's a little bit more informal than register.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Less formal.

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
All right.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So moving on to our second phrase.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is very important because it's often used improperly, right?

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah, people often make mistakes with this phrase.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All right, so let's look at this phrase second year.

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So she is in her second year.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now it seems very simple, so why are we explaining this?

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, it often gets confused with grade.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So when we talk about university, we talk about first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We cannot say grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or year one, year two.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, it's always first year, second year, third year, fourth year.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, very good.

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Or last year.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, last year.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
My last year of college.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Exactly.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Very good.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So now you know how you can explain to someone what year of college or university you're in.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes, that's right.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Very good.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And we have one more phrase to you, and it was when she was getting her class schedule.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So class schedule.

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Class schedule.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Now a schedule is the list of things you do at what time.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right, so it's the timetable of your day or your week.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yep.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
All right.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And your class schedule will say all the classes that you have and what time they're at.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So what other types of schedules can we have?

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You also have maybe a gym schedule.

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's right.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Or even a work schedule.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So we have different types of schedules, and you can use it depending on what you are doing.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Those are all the phrases we have for putting it together today.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And now let's listen to the dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Excuse me.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Is this where I register?

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'd like to sign up for my courses for next semester.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, of course.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I need your student ID, please.

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Here you are.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, Susan.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It says here that you are a business major and that you're in your second year.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is this information correct?

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sure.

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's not a problem.

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you have the list of courses that you want to take this semester?

185
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah.

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Here's my list.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them, though.

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah, that's perfect.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What about the subjects for your minor?

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, yeah.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I almost forgot.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology, and neuroanatomy.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Wow, you're going to be busy this semester.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Okay, here you go.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're registered now.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
All right, so we were talking about second year, first year, third year, et cetera.

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah.

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Now, there are also other names that we give to each year, both for high school and university.

200
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I think this is only for America, like in the United States.

201
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We don't do this in Canada, and I always get so confused.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So, Marco, what is the name you give to first year students?

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, so first year students are called freshmen.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay, because they're fresh.

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Because they're fresh, yeah.

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They just came from middle school.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They just came from high school.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
All right, and what about the second year students?

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
They're called sophomores.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay, because they're soft?

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, it's not soft.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's sophomore, like S-O-P-H.

213
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sophomore.

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Sophomore.

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And then third year students are called juniors.

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay, because they're almost the junior manager.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Exactly.

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Because then last year students are called seniors.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
So, they're the oldest guys in the school.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Exactly.

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So you can say, yeah, I'm a sophomore at Arizona State University.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Okay, so we only use this in America, though, right?

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes, yes, it's very, and not only for university, but also for high school.

224
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
All right, guys, that's all the time we have for today.

226
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I hope you enjoyed this lesson, and if you have any questions or comments, or you want to share with us your experiences in high school or university, please come to the website at EnglishPod.com.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's right.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So, Marco and I are there to answer your questions, and until next time, thanks for listening, and goodbye.
