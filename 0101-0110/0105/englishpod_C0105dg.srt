00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,500
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,099
Thank you very much for your time.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,039
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,760
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,780
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Ah, come on.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,399
It was nothing.

00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:26,760
I'm just doing my job.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:27,640
No.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,780
I think you deserve some recognition here.

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,380
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, Kristen did give me a hand with the slides.

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,600
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,240
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

16
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:45,579
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,840
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,979
You made some really good points.

19
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,640
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

20
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,020
Really, you did a great job.
