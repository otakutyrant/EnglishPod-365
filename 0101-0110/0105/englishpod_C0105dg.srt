00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you very much for your time.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ah, come on.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It was nothing.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm just doing my job.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I think you deserve some recognition here.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, Kristen did give me a hand with the slides.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You made some really good points.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Really, you did a great job.
