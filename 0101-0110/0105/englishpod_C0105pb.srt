00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today, we're bringing you a lesson about the office, so something related to business, right?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And in this lesson, we're learning language you can use to tell someone they did a good job.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So a job well done.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You want to praise somebody.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we're going to listen in as a manager praises his employee on a presentation.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So before we listen to the dialogue, let's take a look very quickly at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, we're going to hear both of these words in the dialogue.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And the first one is a whiz.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Whiz.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
To be a whiz.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So it's an adjective.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Somebody is a whiz.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And whiz comes from the word wizard.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So kind of like a witch, but a guy witch.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, man witch.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So a whiz is someone who is really good at something.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So I can say David is a computer whiz.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Or Antony is a math whiz.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So he's really good at computers or he's really good at math or he knows a lot about math.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Exactly.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And our second word.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, we're going to hear about slides.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Slides.

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
PowerPoint slides.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
PowerPoint slides.

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So everyone knows PowerPoint, right?

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A computer program.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A computer program that you use to make presentations.

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And a slide is one page in that presentation.

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So if you have 10 pages in your PowerPoint presentation, you basically have 10 slides.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Exactly.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Very good.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So now let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and we're going to see what's happening in this business meeting.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you very much for your time.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ah, come on.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It was nothing.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm just doing my job.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, I think you deserve some recognition here.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Well, Kristen did give me a hand with the slides.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You made some really good points.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Really, you did a great job.

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All right, well, it sounds like the employee is a little bit shy or embarrassed by receiving all of these compliments.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah, I guess he's kind of being humble about it.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Exactly.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So why don't we move on to the language now?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There are so many really useful phrases in this dialogue that I think we're just going to focus on those today.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So let's get started with Fluency Builder.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, so today on Fluency Builder, let's start with our first phrase.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The boss was so impressed with the presentation that he said, I was completely blown away.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
To be completely blown away.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, so to be completely blown away.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Or to be blown away.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All right, so what does that mean, to be blown away?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To be surprised and amazed, but in a very positive way.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay, so I can say, I'm surprised, I'm amazed, but I'm still not very clear on this.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why don't we listen to a couple of examples of how we could use this phrase.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Example two.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was blown away when I heard that Jenny and Rick had gotten married.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They had known each other for less than a month.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Example three.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
My parents were blown away when they found out I had a tattoo.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay, so I think that's a little bit clearer now.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And this is a wonderful way to give your praise to someone when they do something really amazing.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, so completely blown away.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You blew me away.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's right.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now, what about our second word?

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, it's quite similar.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The boss said that you really wowed me.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You wowed me.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To wow someone.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, so it's spelled W-O-W, wow.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So when you wow someone, you make that person go, wow.

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, so you impress somebody.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
To wow someone.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can use it as a verb.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You wowed me.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to wow you.

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, I want you to wow me.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, so wow.

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now, let's take a look at our third phrase.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The guy, he's a little bit shy.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's trying to be a little bit humble about, you know, receiving so many compliments.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So he says, oh, it was nothing.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It was nothing.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Really, it was nothing.

114
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It was nothing.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So that's a way of saying it wasn't hard or it's not a big deal.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not that important.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Exactly.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So if somebody's saying, wow, thank you so much for lending me your car, don't worry about it.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It was nothing.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Alright.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a polite way, actually, to respond to a nice compliment.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Very good.

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So before we move on to our next phrase, let's listen to a couple of examples with it was nothing.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Example one.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Thanks for lending me your car this week.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I really appreciate it.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's okay, really.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It was nothing.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Example two.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't believe you organized the surprise birthday party.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you so much.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry about it.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It was nothing.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay, so I think that's pretty clear.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now, our final phrase here for Fluency Builder, the employee said that Kirsten gave him a hand.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, so to give someone a hand.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Give me a hand.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Give me a hand.

139
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Basically, to help someone.

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Help me or assist me.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, so to help someone, give me a hand or let me give you a hand.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's right.

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Alright, very good.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So great phrases in Fluency Builder today.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I think it's time for us to listen to the dialogue for the second time.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We're going to slow it down a little bit so we can catch all these phrases and then we'll come back.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy for next year.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Thank you very much for your time.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ah, come on.

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It was nothing.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm just doing my job.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
No, I think you deserve some recognition here.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, Kirsten did give me a hand with the slides.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
She's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You made some really good points.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Really, you did a great job.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay, so like we said before, there's a lot of really helpful phrases in here.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And we're going to look at a few more of these in putting it together.

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Putting it together.

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, so let's start with the first phrase.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The boss was quite impressed with him, and he said that was quite the presentation.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That was quite the presentation.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
All right, quite the presentation.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So this phrase, quite the presentation, it means it was good, right?

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It was special.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It was very good.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Now we can take the noun presentation out and replace it with any other noun.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right, so I can say Bob is quite the basketball player.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why don't we listen now for a few more examples.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Example two.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Carl is quite the ladies man.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He is very good when it comes to talking to girls.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Example three.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Nancy is quite gifted at math.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
She can solve any math problem you give her.

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So you're saying in a very good way that something is very good.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Or special.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Very special.

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All right, so the boss was very impressed with the employee, and he said, and I saw that you took on board my feedback.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
To take on board my feedback.

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, so take on board something.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So here my feedback is my suggestions, right?

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And when you take on board my feedback, you accept my feedback and you use it.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay, so I can say, for example, I want you to take on board my ideas.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Or Jenny took on board a few of my suggestions.

194
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was really happy.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay, very good.

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So to take on board, to accept and use.

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
All right, so take on board feedback, take on board suggestion, take on board ideas.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, very good.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And we have one more phrase on putting it together today.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
To think something through.

201
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
To think it through.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay, so think it through.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So here the boss said that he took the time to think through my suggestions.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So think through, what does that mean?

205
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
To think carefully about all of the details of something.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, so to take into consideration all the aspects.

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right, so why don't we give an example.

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you're thinking through a plan, right, you don't just think about the end, the outcome.

209
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You want to think about all of the small details, the steps in that plan.

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okay, so maybe I want to buy a new car, but it's a lot of money, so I really have to think it through.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So you have to think carefully about everything that is involved in buying the new car.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
All the money you're going to have to, you know, not spend on parties.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Exactly, you have to think it through, you have to analyze it very carefully.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's right, so let's give a few examples of how we can use this phrase.

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Hey Marco, have you thought through my suggestions?

216
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can say you guys are very young, I think you should think it through before you get married.

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Good advice.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, so to think it through.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay, so three great phrases, and why don't we hear them one more time in our dialogue.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And so that concludes my outline for our marketing strategy next year.

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you very much for your time.

222
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hey, that was quite the presentation.

223
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Honestly, I was completely blown away by your strategy outline.

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I've got to say, Alex, you really wowed me today.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ah, come on, it was nothing.

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm just doing my job.

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, I think you deserve some recognition here.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I mean, if I look back on your previous presentations, this is a huge improvement.

229
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Well, Kristen did give me a hand with the slides, she's a real whiz on PowerPoint.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And I saw that you took on board my feedback about pricing strategies.

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I really appreciate you taking the time to think through my suggestions.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, well, that was some good advice.

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You made some really good points.

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, I just wanted to say, well done.

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Really, you did a great job.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay, great dialogue and some interesting phrases for giving praise, right?

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's, I think, very important in the workplace.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, and you know what, I read recently that something like six out of every ten employees don't get regular praise from their boss.

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, it's very important.

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And in some cultures, well, it's not very common to praise or to give positive feedback to their employees.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yeah, but I think for Western employees, actually, it's really important and it helps them work harder the more times they hear, job well done.

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, very good.

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So now you have the tools that maybe you can use with your employees or...

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
With your friends.

245
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
With your friends.

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
