00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,379
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,839
Welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,599
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,539
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,640
And today we're going to be talking about one of our favorite topics as always.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,240
Food.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:13,919
Food.

8
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,519
We're going to be at a restaurant.

9
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:25,320
And, you know, one of the most difficult or embarrassing things to deal with at a restaurant is what to say when you don't like the food or when it's bad quality food.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:25,760
Right.

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,820
So maybe we have to complain about the food or maybe even the service, right?

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,359
That's right.

13
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:39,939
And in this lesson, we're going to be learning some really wonderful words and phrases that you can use when you need to complain about the food or the service in a restaurant.

14
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:48,240
Okay, so before we listen to what happens in this restaurant with this food, let's take a look very quickly at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,520
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,460
Okay, we're only going to do one word today.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,659
And this you'll hear in the dialogue.

18
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,659
An establishment.

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:58,920
Establishment.

20
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:00,859
This kind of establishment.

21
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,280
Okay, so when I say an establishment, that's a noun, what is an establishment?

22
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:11,079
It's basically a fancy word for a business or a restaurant in this case.

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,319
In this case, it's a restaurant.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:12,560
Yeah.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,379
But in general, you can say it's a business.

26
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:17,040
So you have a very fine establishment.

27
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:17,579
That's right.

28
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,400
So an establishment, a type of business, a place of business, really.

29
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,299
Very good.

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,700
All right, so now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue.

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,799
Okay, we're going to find out what's going on here.

32
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:33,480
Apparently there is a very angry customer and we're going to find out why.

33
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,819
Excuse me, waiter.

34
00:01:41,739 --> 00:01:42,239
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,239
What can I do for you?

36
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:50,140
I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water, brought any bread to the table, and our appetizer haven't been served yet.

37
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,359
You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,459
I'm sorry, sir.

39
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,959
I'll check on your order right away.

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,340
Relax, honey.

41
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,120
The place is busy tonight and I've heard the food is amazing.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,700
Here you are, sir.

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,260
The foie gras for the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

44
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,960
Waiter, I heard a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

45
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,439
The soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,139
It's completely inedible.

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,139
Okay, I do apologize for that.

48
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,560
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

49
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,099
Take this foie gras back as well.

50
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,000
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,479
And look at the portion size.

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,259
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver?

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
Right away, sir.

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,599
Honey, come on.

55
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,159
The foie gras was fine.

56
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,900
Why are you making such a big deal?

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,759
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

58
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,020
What do you mean?

59
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,900
We are paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks.

60
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,860
I expect value for money.

61
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,319
Here you are, sir.

62
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,039
I hope it is all right now.

63
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,879
The chef has prepared it especially for you.

64
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:49,599
Yes, fine.

65
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Honey, are you all right?

66
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, I guess that's one lesson.

67
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,099
Hey, if you're in a restaurant, don't be too rude to the waiter.

68
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,360
You never know what's going to happen.

69
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,539
The waiter and the cook, right?

70
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,280
Yeah, you don't want to offend that kitchen staff.

71
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:39,680
All right, so we'll talk about that a little bit later on, but now I think we had some really interesting vocabulary of how to describe food that is not well-prepared.

72
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,039
And we can take a look at that now in Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,120
All right, so the guy in this dialogue, he ordered a mushroom soup and he complained that the mushroom soup was too runny.

74
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,419
Okay, the soup is too runny.

75
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:56,939
Runny.

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,259
So he wanted a cream of mushroom, so it should be a little bit thicker.

77
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:01,680
Yep.

78
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,840
But in this case, it was runny.

79
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,120
So when something is runny, it's too liquid.

80
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,000
Too liquid.

81
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,120
And I think we can relate it to a runny nose, right?

82
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,639
Exactly.

83
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,919
Okay, so when liquid is coming out of your nose, a runny nose, in this case, the soup is runny.

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,519
All right.

85
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:20,759
And another thing that he was complaining about, the food was over seasoned.

86
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,439
Over seasoned.

87
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,019
The food is over seasoned.

88
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,100
Okay, so if the food is over seasoned.

89
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,439
It's too salty.

90
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,699
So it's another way of saying it's too salty.

91
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,639
Yeah, it's kind of a fancy cooking term.

92
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,800
Now can I say, if there's too much pepper in the food, can I say it's over seasoned?

93
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,339
Well, technically no.

94
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,279
When a cook says something is over seasoned, he's talking salt only.

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,160
Only salt.

96
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,560
Okay.

97
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:52,360
So the cream of mushroom is very runny, it's over seasoned, and he said it's completely inedible.

98
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,240
Inedible.

99
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,220
It's inedible.

100
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:55,779
Inedible.

101
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,720
Now this word edible.

102
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,199
You can eat it.

103
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,000
You can eat it.

104
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,480
So we have this prefix inedible.

105
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
You cannot eat it.

106
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
This is not possible.

107
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,519
Yeah, and it doesn't mean that physically you can't eat it, it just means it's pretty disgusting.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, this food is inedible.

109
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,819
And then he started to complain about the other dish, and he said that it's rubbery.

110
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:18,819
Rubbery.

111
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,839
The foie gras was rubbery.

112
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,079
All right, so I think we noticed the word rubber.

113
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,339
So obviously if a food is rubbery, it tastes, or it's too chewy.

114
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,079
It's like chewing on the bottom of your shoe, right?

115
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,420
Okay, so it's too hard to chew or to swallow.

116
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,019
Exactly.

117
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:38,860
All right.

118
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,699
Apparently the food was rubbery because it's completely overcooked.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,600
Overcooked.

120
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,079
All right, we have overcooked.

121
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,019
So when something is overcooked, I mean, it's easy to understand that it's cooked too much.

122
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,300
But it doesn't mean that it's burnt, right?

123
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,639
No, so maybe you've ordered your steak to be rare, but it comes to you well done.

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,439
So it's not burnt, but it's cooked too much.

125
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,720
So, also I guess we can say like chicken, sometimes if you overcook chicken, it comes out too dry.

126
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,720
All right, so to overcook something.

127
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,259
And finally he was complaining about the size of the dish and he said this is a sliver of duck liver.

128
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,740
Okay, a sliver.

129
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,620
A sliver.

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,779
All right, now this word sliver is like a slice, right?

131
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,860
A very small, tiny little slice.

132
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:34,600
Okay, so we can say, okay, I just want a sliver of bacon for breakfast.

133
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,959
All right, why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use sliver?

134
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,879
Example one.

135
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,740
No, John's on a diet.

136
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
He'll just have a sliver of cake and no ice cream.

137
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,720
Example two.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,620
I'm really full, but it looks so delicious.

139
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,579
Can you just cut me a sliver?

140
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,379
Example three.

141
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,600
You call this sliver of beef on my plate a meal?

142
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,360
There's almost nothing here.

143
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,680
And those are all the words we had for language takeaway.

144
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:14,259
Now you have, so we've given you different adjectives of describing food that is not well prepared.

145
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:20,000
So now let's move on to some other phrases that the customer used to complain in Fluency Builder.

146
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,819
Okay, so before we get to the customer complaining language, I want to look at a phrase that the waiter used to apologize.

147
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,220
He said, I do apologize.

148
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,019
I do apologize.

149
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,920
I do apologize.

150
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,579
Now, why is this phrase so interesting?

151
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,620
Well, I mean, it's pretty easy to understand the meaning, but I want to look at why he added this verb do.

152
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:54,560
Well, he added the verb do it to this phrase to make it seem a little bit stronger, to give a little more power to his apology.

153
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,240
Right, so if you have an affirmative phrase like I apologize, it's good.

154
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,060
But if you want to give it a little bit more emphasis, you can say I do apologize.

155
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,500
Why don't we give an example?

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,139
So I might say this, Marco, I didn't know we had a party tonight.

157
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,300
And I might say, what?

158
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,399
I did tell you about it last week.

159
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,339
Right, so you're just giving a little bit more power to the statement that you told me.

160
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,899
So this do, did, does becomes an auxiliary to make it more powerful, to give it more emphasis.

161
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:28,819
Yeah, exactly.

162
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:35,460
So a neat little phrase, something you can use if you want to make your apologies sound maybe a little bit stronger.

163
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,799
Alright, now moving on to the next phrase.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,659
He was complaining about the food and it was terrible.

165
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,500
And he said, I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,940
Okay, let's break this one down into two sections.

167
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,799
We'll start with shelling out.

168
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,539
Alright, so to shell out.

169
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,360
So when you shell out, you pay for something.

170
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,700
Alright, but this gives you the sensation that you are, that you don't really want to pay.

171
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
You're a bit unhappy about it.

172
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,840
Right, so you want to shell out your money.

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,659
Why don't we listen to some examples to show us how we can use this phrase to shell out.

174
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,700
Example one.

175
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:18,840
Great, it's my girlfriend's birthday this month, so I'm going to have to shell out for a present.

176
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,419
Example two.

177
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,720
I really want those shoes, but I can't really afford to shell out four hundred dollars.

178
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,700
Example three.

179
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:33,700
I can't believe it.

180
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,299
Ella shelled out the eight hundred bucks for the tickets.

181
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,720
I thought I would have to pay.

182
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,860
Alright, so now that we understand shell out, let's move on to the second part of that sentence.

183
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,940
My hard-earned bucks.

184
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,620
Hard-earned bucks.

185
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,460
My hard-earned bucks.

186
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,700
Okay, so bucks are dollars, right?

187
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,179
Only dollars, right?

188
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Yeah, not pounds, not euros.

189
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,860
But his hard-earned bucks is money he had to work really hard for.

190
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,740
So I can also say my hard-earned money, right?

191
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,000
Or my hard-earned cash.

192
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:07,539
Exactly.

193
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:08,779
Very good.

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,740
So you worked hard to get it.

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,639
Alright, so three great phrases that can be used when you're complaining in a restaurant.

196
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,039
And why don't we hear them one last time in context by listening to the dialogue?

197
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,919
I've heard the food is amazing, anyway.

198
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:48,879
Here you are, sir.

199
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,379
The foie gras for the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

200
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:54,879
Waiter!

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,139
I heard a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

202
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,620
This soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

203
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,279
It's completely inedible.

204
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,320
Okay, I do apologize for that.

205
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,720
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

206
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,279
Take this foie gras back as well.

207
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,179
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

208
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:11,659
And look at the portion size.

209
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,440
How can you charge twenty-five dollars for a sliver of duck liver?

210
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,120
Right away, sir.

211
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,779
Honey, come on.

212
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,320
The foie gras was fine.

213
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,059
Why are you making such a big deal?

214
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,940
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

215
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,179
What do you mean?

216
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,059
We are paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks.

217
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,059
I expect value from money.

218
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,500
Here you are, sir.

219
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,220
I hope it is alright now.

220
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,080
The chef has prepared it, especially for you.

221
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,840
Yes, fine.

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,500
Honey, are you alright?

223
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,779
No.

224
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:08,860
So complaining at a restaurant and actually sending food back is not uncommon in the U.S.

225
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:09,639
Yeah, of course.

226
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,860
If the food's bad, of course you're going to send it back.

227
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,879
But maybe in other cultures, I think people would be a little bit more reluctant to do something like this.

228
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:27,779
But hey, you know what's an interesting thing about the way Americans eat in restaurants is sometimes at the end of the meal, if they haven't finished everything, they might ask for a doggy bag.

229
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:28,840
A doggy bag, yeah.

230
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:30,899
So what is that, a doggy bag?

231
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:43,240
Well, usually if you order a big meal or, you know, half your steak is left over on your plate, you would ask for a doggy bag and they would bring you a little box or a bag and you would take it to supposedly give it to your dog.

232
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:50,740
Right, so it's sort of like you tell the waiter, oh, you know, the steak was so good, I couldn't finish it, can I take some home to my dog?

233
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:53,320
Right, so you would just ask, waiter, can I have a doggy bag?

234
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,320
Right, but it's sort of like code for I'm going to eat this tomorrow for lunch.

235
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,320
Exactly, because people wouldn't really give it to their dogs.

236
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:08,299
You know, that steak wrapped up in a fancy sort of foil salon is going to be pretty delicious the next day.

237
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,559
Right, yeah, it's actually very common in the U.S., but in other countries, people will leave entire plates of food on the table.

238
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,899
Like you'd be totally impolite to ask the waiter to pack up the food for you.

239
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:30,419
Exactly, so a little bit of cultural differences, but we want to know what you think and how things are done maybe in your country with complaining or sending food back or even this whole doggy bag situation.

240
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:35,080
That's right, why don't you visit our website, EnglishPod.com, and tell us about it.

241
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:40,399
Alright, we'll be there to answer any questions or comments, but we've got to go now, so until then, goodbye!
