00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're going to be talking about one of our favorite topics as always.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Food.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Food.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're going to be at a restaurant.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And, you know, one of the most difficult or embarrassing things to deal with at a restaurant is what to say when you don't like the food or when it's bad quality food.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Right.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So maybe we have to complain about the food or maybe even the service, right?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And in this lesson, we're going to be learning some really wonderful words and phrases that you can use when you need to complain about the food or the service in a restaurant.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay, so before we listen to what happens in this restaurant with this food, let's take a look very quickly at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay, we're only going to do one word today.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And this you'll hear in the dialogue.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
An establishment.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Establishment.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This kind of establishment.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, so when I say an establishment, that's a noun, what is an establishment?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's basically a fancy word for a business or a restaurant in this case.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In this case, it's a restaurant.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But in general, you can say it's a business.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So you have a very fine establishment.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's right.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So an establishment, a type of business, a place of business, really.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Very good.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right, so now it's time for us to listen to our dialogue.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, we're going to find out what's going on here.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Apparently there is a very angry customer and we're going to find out why.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Excuse me, waiter.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes, sir.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What can I do for you?

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes and no one has offered me a glass of water, brought any bread to the table, and our appetizer haven't been served yet.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know, in this kind of establishment, I'd expect much better service.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm sorry, sir.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll check on your order right away.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Relax, honey.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The place is busy tonight and I've heard the food is amazing.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here you are, sir.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The foie gras for the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Waiter, I heard a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's completely inedible.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, I do apologize for that.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Take this foie gras back as well.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And look at the portion size.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver?

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Right away, sir.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Honey, come on.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The foie gras was fine.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why are you making such a big deal?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What do you mean?

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We are paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I expect value for money.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Here you are, sir.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I hope it is all right now.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The chef has prepared it especially for you.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes, fine.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Honey, are you all right?

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, I guess that's one lesson.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hey, if you're in a restaurant, don't be too rude to the waiter.

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You never know what's going to happen.

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The waiter and the cook, right?

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, you don't want to offend that kitchen staff.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:39,000
All right, so we'll talk about that a little bit later on, but now I think we had some really interesting vocabulary of how to describe food that is not well-prepared.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And we can take a look at that now in Language Takeaway.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All right, so the guy in this dialogue, he ordered a mushroom soup and he complained that the mushroom soup was too runny.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, the soup is too runny.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Runny.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So he wanted a cream of mushroom, so it should be a little bit thicker.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yep.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But in this case, it was runny.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So when something is runny, it's too liquid.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Too liquid.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And I think we can relate it to a runny nose, right?

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, so when liquid is coming out of your nose, a runny nose, in this case, the soup is runny.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And another thing that he was complaining about, the food was over seasoned.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Over seasoned.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The food is over seasoned.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay, so if the food is over seasoned.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's too salty.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So it's another way of saying it's too salty.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, it's kind of a fancy cooking term.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now can I say, if there's too much pepper in the food, can I say it's over seasoned?

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Well, technically no.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
When a cook says something is over seasoned, he's talking salt only.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Only salt.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So the cream of mushroom is very runny, it's over seasoned, and he said it's completely inedible.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Inedible.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's inedible.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Inedible.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now this word edible.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can eat it.

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You can eat it.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So we have this prefix inedible.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You cannot eat it.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is not possible.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, and it doesn't mean that physically you can't eat it, it just means it's pretty disgusting.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, this food is inedible.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then he started to complain about the other dish, and he said that it's rubbery.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Rubbery.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The foie gras was rubbery.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
All right, so I think we noticed the word rubber.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So obviously if a food is rubbery, it tastes, or it's too chewy.

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like chewing on the bottom of your shoe, right?

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, so it's too hard to chew or to swallow.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Exactly.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All right.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Apparently the food was rubbery because it's completely overcooked.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Overcooked.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right, we have overcooked.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So when something is overcooked, I mean, it's easy to understand that it's cooked too much.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But it doesn't mean that it's burnt, right?

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No, so maybe you've ordered your steak to be rare, but it comes to you well done.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So it's not burnt, but it's cooked too much.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So, also I guess we can say like chicken, sometimes if you overcook chicken, it comes out too dry.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
All right, so to overcook something.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And finally he was complaining about the size of the dish and he said this is a sliver of duck liver.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, a sliver.

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A sliver.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All right, now this word sliver is like a slice, right?

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A very small, tiny little slice.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, so we can say, okay, I just want a sliver of bacon for breakfast.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right, why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use sliver?

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Example one.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No, John's on a diet.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He'll just have a sliver of cake and no ice cream.

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Example two.

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm really full, but it looks so delicious.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Can you just cut me a sliver?

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Example three.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You call this sliver of beef on my plate a meal?

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There's almost nothing here.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And those are all the words we had for language takeaway.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now you have, so we've given you different adjectives of describing food that is not well prepared.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So now let's move on to some other phrases that the customer used to complain in Fluency Builder.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, so before we get to the customer complaining language, I want to look at a phrase that the waiter used to apologize.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He said, I do apologize.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I do apologize.

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I do apologize.

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now, why is this phrase so interesting?

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, I mean, it's pretty easy to understand the meaning, but I want to look at why he added this verb do.

152
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Well, he added the verb do it to this phrase to make it seem a little bit stronger, to give a little more power to his apology.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right, so if you have an affirmative phrase like I apologize, it's good.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But if you want to give it a little bit more emphasis, you can say I do apologize.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why don't we give an example?

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So I might say this, Marco, I didn't know we had a party tonight.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And I might say, what?

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I did tell you about it last week.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Right, so you're just giving a little bit more power to the statement that you told me.

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So this do, did, does becomes an auxiliary to make it more powerful, to give it more emphasis.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, exactly.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So a neat little phrase, something you can use if you want to make your apologies sound maybe a little bit stronger.

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Alright, now moving on to the next phrase.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He was complaining about the food and it was terrible.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And he said, I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks.

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, let's break this one down into two sections.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We'll start with shelling out.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Alright, so to shell out.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So when you shell out, you pay for something.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Alright, but this gives you the sensation that you are, that you don't really want to pay.

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're a bit unhappy about it.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Right, so you want to shell out your money.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why don't we listen to some examples to show us how we can use this phrase to shell out.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Example one.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Great, it's my girlfriend's birthday this month, so I'm going to have to shell out for a present.

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Example two.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I really want those shoes, but I can't really afford to shell out four hundred dollars.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Example three.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can't believe it.

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ella shelled out the eight hundred bucks for the tickets.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I thought I would have to pay.

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Alright, so now that we understand shell out, let's move on to the second part of that sentence.

183
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
My hard-earned bucks.

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hard-earned bucks.

185
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
My hard-earned bucks.

186
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay, so bucks are dollars, right?

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Only dollars, right?

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, not pounds, not euros.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But his hard-earned bucks is money he had to work really hard for.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So I can also say my hard-earned money, right?

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Or my hard-earned cash.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Exactly.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Very good.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you worked hard to get it.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Alright, so three great phrases that can be used when you're complaining in a restaurant.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And why don't we hear them one last time in context by listening to the dialogue?

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've heard the food is amazing, anyway.

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Here you are, sir.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The foie gras for the lady and a mushroom soup for you.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Waiter!

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I heard a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's completely inedible.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, I do apologize for that.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Take this foie gras back as well.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And look at the portion size.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How can you charge twenty-five dollars for a sliver of duck liver?

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right away, sir.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Honey, come on.

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The foie gras was fine.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are you making such a big deal?

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

215
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What do you mean?

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We are paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I expect value from money.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Here you are, sir.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I hope it is alright now.

220
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The chef has prepared it, especially for you.

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, fine.

222
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Honey, are you alright?

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So complaining at a restaurant and actually sending food back is not uncommon in the U.S.

225
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, of course.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If the food's bad, of course you're going to send it back.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But maybe in other cultures, I think people would be a little bit more reluctant to do something like this.

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But hey, you know what's an interesting thing about the way Americans eat in restaurants is sometimes at the end of the meal, if they haven't finished everything, they might ask for a doggy bag.

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A doggy bag, yeah.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So what is that, a doggy bag?

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, usually if you order a big meal or, you know, half your steak is left over on your plate, you would ask for a doggy bag and they would bring you a little box or a bag and you would take it to supposedly give it to your dog.

232
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Right, so it's sort of like you tell the waiter, oh, you know, the steak was so good, I couldn't finish it, can I take some home to my dog?

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Right, so you would just ask, waiter, can I have a doggy bag?

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right, but it's sort of like code for I'm going to eat this tomorrow for lunch.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Exactly, because people wouldn't really give it to their dogs.

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know, that steak wrapped up in a fancy sort of foil salon is going to be pretty delicious the next day.

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Right, yeah, it's actually very common in the U.S., but in other countries, people will leave entire plates of food on the table.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Like you'd be totally impolite to ask the waiter to pack up the food for you.

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Exactly, so a little bit of cultural differences, but we want to know what you think and how things are done maybe in your country with complaining or sending food back or even this whole doggy bag situation.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's right, why don't you visit our website, EnglishPod.com, and tell us about it.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Alright, we'll be there to answer any questions or comments, but we've got to go now, so until then, goodbye!
