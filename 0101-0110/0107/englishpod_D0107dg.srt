00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,980
EnglishPod.com and a mushroom soup for you.

2
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:35,420
Waiter!

3
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,679
I heard a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

4
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,140
This soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,840
It's completely inedible.

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,840
Okay, I do apologize for that.

7
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,259
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

8
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,799
Take this foie gras back as well.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,700
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,179
And look at the portion size!

11
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,979
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver?

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,679
Right away, sir.

13
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,299
Honey, come on.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,859
The foie gras was fine.

15
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:01,579
Why are you making such a big deal?

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,480
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:05,719
What do you mean?

18
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:08,599
We are paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks!

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,599
I expect value from money!

20
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,000
Here you are, sir.

21
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,760
I hope it is alright now.

22
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,579
The chef has prepared it especially for you.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,420
Yes, fine.

24
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:24,040
Honey, are you alright?

25
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,599
Oh, God!
