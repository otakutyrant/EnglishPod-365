00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,000
EnglishPod.com and a mushroom soup for you.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Waiter!

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I heard a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This soup is obviously too runny and it's over seasoned.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's completely inedible.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Okay, I do apologize for that.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Can I bring you another soup or would you like to order something else?

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Take this foie gras back as well.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's rubbery and completely overcooked.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And look at the portion size!

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How can you charge $25 for a sliver of duck liver?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Right away, sir.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Honey, come on.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The foie gras was fine.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why are you making such a big deal?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you trying to get our meal comped again?

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What do you mean?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We are paying for this and I'm shelling out my hard-earned bucks!

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I expect value from money!

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here you are, sir.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I hope it is alright now.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The chef has prepared it especially for you.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, fine.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Honey, are you alright?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, God!
