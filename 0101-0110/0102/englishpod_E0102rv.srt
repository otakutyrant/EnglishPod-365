127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think the Senator is in the pocket of the tobacco industry.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000

So called.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The so called disaster actually opened up a lot of opportunities for us.

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're so full of it.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You've never been to the moon.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't believe a word Tom says.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's full of it.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think this argument is full of it.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There's no way that the global temperature is getting cooler.
