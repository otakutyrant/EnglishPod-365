127
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,899
I think the Senator is in the pocket of the tobacco industry.

128
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,720

So called.

134
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,639
The so called disaster actually opened up a lot of opportunities for us.

135
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,059
You're so full of it.

136
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,440
You've never been to the moon.

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,340
Don't believe a word Tom says.

138
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,820
He's full of it.

139
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,740
I think this argument is full of it.

140
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,340
There's no way that the global temperature is getting cooler.
