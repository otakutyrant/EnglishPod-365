00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:14,000
EnglishPod.com And therefore global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Questions?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yeah.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In the lecture you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well yes.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Essentially the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But are global temperatures rising?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you look at the data from 1975 you'll...

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You'll be misled.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you were serious you would look at the record starting in the 1880s then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Young lady, I beg to differ.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides and I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing that there's some kind of climate crisis.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This scaremongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species and investing in renewable energy.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
At the very least you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, and the duplicitous one at that.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which say smoking doesn't harm health?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're full of it.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.
