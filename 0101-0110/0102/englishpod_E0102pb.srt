00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we have an advanced lesson for all of you and a very good one because we're going to be talking about a very serious topic, global warming.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And even though most people agree that global warming is a big problem, there's still this sort of fringe element of people who believe that actually global warming doesn't exist.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Exactly.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So that's what we're going to be looking at today.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But before we tell you more or less what the dialogue is about, let's take a look at some words in Vocabulary Preview.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Vocabulary Preview.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We're going to look at two words here, and you'll hear both of these in the dialogue.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So the first one is polar ice caps.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Polar ice caps.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Polar ice caps.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So when we talk about polar ice caps, polar is?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Like the poles.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The poles, right?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The north and south poles of the Earth.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay, so the extreme?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The top and bottom.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The top and bottom of the planet.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yep.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, and what about ice caps?

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So the polar ice caps are masses of ice that live or that exist on the top and the bottom of the world.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We have these big chunks of ice that are on the top and the bottom of the planet.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, they're there all year round.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, so these are the polar ice caps.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What about our next word?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, the next word is endangered species.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
An endangered species.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
An endangered species.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay, so endangered species.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a type of animal that is at risk of completely dying out.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay, so it's not completely extinct.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So they're still...

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's in danger.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, in danger of.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So an example of endangered species would be?

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The Bengal tigers.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Okay, the tigers or the pandas, right?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Or maybe gorillas.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Right, so all of these animals, there are very few of them left in the world, so they are endangered species.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, so with that, I think we're just about ready to turn to our dialogue.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now here we're going to learn a lot of language that you can use when you want to make an argument or express your point of view in a very sort of academic way.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But Marco, what are we arguing about here?

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So we're going to listen as a college professor is lecturing about global warming and well, one of the students doesn't really agree with what he's saying.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Questions?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In the lecture, you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, yes.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If that's true, and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But are global temperatures rising?

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll- You'll be misled.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s, then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Young lady, I beg to differ.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing that there's some kind of climate crisis.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This scaremongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, and the duplicitous one at that.

73
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which say smoking doesn't harm health?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're full of it.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
All right, so apparently this college professor is not very truthful in what he's saying, right?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, yeah, maybe he believes it, but they certainly have very strong and differing opinions.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So that's the interesting part, is that we heard a lot of language that she used to argue her point of view.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So this is interesting, and we can start now looking at some of this language in Language Takeaway.

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Language Takeaway.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So the college professor was arguing against this idea of global warming, and she said, look, it's an indisputable fact.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, an indisputable fact.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
An indisputable fact.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so let's break it down, and let's take a look at this word, indisputable.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You can't argue against it.

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so something indisputable is you can't argue with it, and well, a fact.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Something that's true.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, so you can't argue with this truth.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This piece of information, yeah.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All right, indisputable fact.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So why don't we give a few examples?

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's an indisputable fact that China is the most populous nation on earth.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay, exactly.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Or it's an indisputable fact that EnglishPod is the best podcast out there.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Indeed, it is indisputable.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, so indisputable fact.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And what about our next word?

99
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Well, the student accused the professor of scaremongering.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Scaremongering.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Scaremongering.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, now this is kind of a strange word, scaremongering.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah, and I think some examples will help us to understand the meaning a little bit better.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Example one.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Software flaws are not the same as virus attacks, and saying otherwise is just scaremongering.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Example two.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There's been a lot of scaremongering caused by the rumor that mobile phones cause cancer.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so basically we understand that it's kind of putting fear in people's minds.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, it's sort of like selling fear for your own benefit.

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, so making people afraid for some objective or some purpose.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah, and you know, this word reminds me of the word a fishmonger.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, a fishmonger, what's that?

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Which is basically a seller of fish.

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So a scaremonger is a seller of fear.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay, interesting.

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So now we have a way of remembering it.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Scaremongering.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
All right, and moving on to our next word, we have autocratic.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Autocratic.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
An autocratic country.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So an autocratic country is ruled by someone who holds total power.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, so we have an autocratic country.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So basically we have a leader that rules everything, right?

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Right.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But we can apply it not only to a country, we can say a person is autocratic.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, you could say, oh, I can't stand my boss's autocratic leadership style.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Or maybe a company.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This company is a very autocratic organization.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, very good.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And what about our last word?

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The student accused the professor of being duplicitous.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay, so she said he is duplicitous.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, duplicitous.

134
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right, what does that mean?

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When you are duplicitous, you have behavior that is dishonest and is designed to trick people.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, so you're not a very honest person if you're duplicitous.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah, you're telling lies as a means of making people do something or tricking them.

138
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, very good.

139
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So a duplicitous person or a duplicitous idea, maybe?

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, all right, so these are all the words that we have on Language Takeaway today.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But now, let's move on to some very interesting phrases that we can use to put forward some arguments in Fluency Builder.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, and Marco, you actually just mentioned our first phrase, which is, I'm putting forth the argument that.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, so putting forth the argument that.

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Mm-hmm.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So if you put forth an argument...

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You present it.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You present it, or you push it towards somebody.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, you give it.

150
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Uh-huh.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So can we just put forth an argument?

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Well, actually, you can put forth a lot of things, like put forth a suggestion.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Okay, I'm putting forth a suggestion that we should get a new computer.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Or an idea.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Tim put forth the idea that we should go on vacation to Hawaii.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, good idea.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right, so you can put forth many different things.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So the professor obviously is putting forth the argument that global warming is a myth, and the student obviously totally disagreed.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And she said you have to concede that.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, you have to concede that.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You have to concede that.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
All right, so this word, concede, or you have to concede, why don't we listen to some examples before we listen to the meaning?

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Example one.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sorry, but I can't concede with you on this point.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Example two.

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Julie conceded that she might have forgotten her sister's birthday.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Example three.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Both philosophers conceded that their philosophies have some errors.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okay, so you have to concede that.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Basically, you have to agree that this one point in my argument is true.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Maybe you're arguing many different points with somebody, but you tell them, well, you have to concede that the earth is round.

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, so that part I can't argue with.

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's really true.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, very good.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So concede.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now, at the end of the dialogue, the student accused the professor of being in the pocket of the oil lobby.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okay, so he's in the pocket of.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
To be in the pocket of.

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
All right, so if I have somebody in my pocket, what does that mean?

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It means basically you're bribing them.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, so maybe I have the senator in my pocket.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, so obviously you're paying the senator to do what you want.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, very good.

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
So it's another way, it's a very informal way of saying I'm bribing somebody or that person is being bribed.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So why don't we move to our final phrase.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The student was talking about the professor's so-called findings.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Okay, so your so-called findings.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So-called.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So this word so-called.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You use this word when you want to take away from the importance of an idea.

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
All right, so I use it before a noun, right?

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right, so for example, my so-called friends.

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, so these friends are not really your friends maybe.

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So yeah, they're friends in name but they don't act like friends.

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, so you can say my so-called job.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay, so maybe you kind of go to work but do nothing all day.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Right, or maybe you don't even really like what you do.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Right, so my so-called job, my so-called friends, or maybe my so-called teacher.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, so this is a bad teacher.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Exactly, so we use it a lot with many different nouns, right?

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right, so that's our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Now I think it will help us to understand these words and phrases a little bit better to hear them again in context.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century.

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Questions?

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, in the lecture you said there's more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling.

207
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Well yes, essentially the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles.

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary ecosystem.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If that's true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But are global temperatures rising?

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you look at the data from 1975, you'll...

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You'll be misled.

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Then you would see how dramatically the Earth's temperature has changed.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Young lady, I beg to differ.

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there's evidence for both sides.

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I'm putting forth the argument that there's greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis.

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Look, it's an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing that there's some kind of climate crisis.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This scaremongering is done quite simply for political reasons.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isn't the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species, and investing in renewable energy.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil.

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I've never been so disrespected in all of my days.

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm a professor, a scientist, and a researcher of high regard.

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, and the duplicitous one at that.

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Everyone knows you're in the pocket of the oil lobby.

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies, which say smoking doesn't harm health?

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're full of it.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Some people just cannot handle civil debate.

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Alright, very good.

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So, interesting ways of putting forth arguments and, well, it's an interesting topic and very controversial, right?

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's right.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
But what I noticed in this dialogue is that the student was pretty assertive in putting forth her argument and standing up to the teacher.

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Right, she argued with the teacher a lot.

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And this is interesting because it's a very cultural aspect, I think, right?

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, in North American universities, there is this idea that it's really important to think critically and to argue against different ideas and to really speak up when you don't agree with something.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Right, so basically there's this culture of questioning, not only what you're being taught, but you can also question the teacher.

240
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You don't actually have to believe everything that the teacher is saying.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Exactly.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And actually, I think this situation is really interesting.

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You know, you always go to these lectures and there's always a question and answer period at the end of the lectures.

244
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And I think that there's this group of sort of academically-minded people who feel like it's really cool to ask these really difficult questions and engage in arguments with the profs.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, yeah, that's really true.

246
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But actually, she used a lot of polite language and a lot of polite ways of actually arguing with the professor until the last point when she said you're full of it.

247
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, you're full of it.

248
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Right, you're full of it.

249
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So what's she saying here?

250
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
All right, she's basically saying that you're full of shit.

251
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Orko.

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So yeah, you wouldn't really say that.

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So to be a little bit less rude, you would just say you're full of it.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, but that is one step too far.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I think this would be considered a little bit rude.

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah, for a professor, yeah.

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But I guess if you don't believe what your friend is telling you, or maybe he's exaggerating, you can say, oh, you're full of it.

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Okay, so some great argumentative language here in this dialogue, but we want to give you an opportunity to try out some of this language.

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Bye.

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Bye.
