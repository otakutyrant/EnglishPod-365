00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:05,940
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,219 --> 00:00:07,080
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we have another romantic lesson, kind of romantic.

5
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,599
A little romantic.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,379
We got a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they're apologizing to each other.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,019
Okay, so it's a very common situation and we're going to be talking about love.

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:28,699
We're also going to talk about different pet names that are commonly used in English.

9
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,079
That are used with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,340
Okay, very good.

11
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:39,280
So, let's listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what's happening with our couple.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,859
Can we talk?

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,420
Sure, honey.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,780
We're talking now, aren't we?

15
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,479
You know what I mean.

16
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:03,439
Yeah, I know.

17
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,579
I want to know where this relationship is going.

18
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,299
I'm in love with you.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,079
And I need to know- You know, I think you're awesome.

20
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:14,659
I'm awesome.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,519
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,780
Honey.

23
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,939
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,400
All right.

25
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:28,879
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate- Well, maybe it's just time we- Baby, I love you so much.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,500
You do?

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,859
I love you and I think you're awesome.

28
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:33,879
Oh, I love you too.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
Come on, put the gun down.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:36,959
Oh, baby.

31
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,620
I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,480
Okay, so romantic and dramatic.

33
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, I think she really needed to hear that- Right, so I think she really wanted to hear I love you.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,739
And there's some interesting phrases here in this dialogue.

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,680
And today we're going to focus mostly on phrases.

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,060
So why don't we start with Fluency Builder.

38
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,280
Fluency Builder.

39
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,520
Okay, on Fluency Builder today, we are going to take a look at some of these phrases.

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,020
And the first one is very important and very different.

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,819
So obviously this dialogue is about love and we heard two different ways that this word is used.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,900
And the first one is to love someone.

43
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,300
Right, so he said, I love you.

44
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,460
Yeah, I love you.

45
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,819
We all pretty much understand what that means.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,780
Right, but they also mentioned to be in love with someone.

47
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,139
Okay, so he said, I am in love with you.

48
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm in love with you.

49
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,819
In love.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,960
Okay, so what's the difference between to love and to be in love?

51
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,539
To be in love with someone means that you have these strong romantic feelings towards somebody.

52
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,240
That's right.

53
00:02:53,639 --> 00:03:00,139
So you can only be in love with your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your husband or your wife.

54
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,159
So you can love your parents, you can love your family, but you can't be in love with them.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,419
You can only be in love with your girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife.

56
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,120
That's right.

57
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:09,979
Okay.

58
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:16,780
So moving on to the next phrase, now the girl asked her boyfriend, can we talk?

59
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,460
Can we talk?

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,419
Can we talk?

61
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,360
This is a very simple sentence.

62
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:22,939
Right, we know the meaning, right?

63
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,300
But why does she say can we talk?

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,280
Okay, so you use this when you want to start a conversation about something serious.

65
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,520
Okay, so if you wanted to talk to me about my new shirt.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,300
I wouldn't ask, I wouldn't say, hey, Marco, can we talk?

67
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,199
Oh, I really like your shirt.

68
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,000
Where'd you get it?

69
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:43,879
Exactly, right.

70
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,360
So it has to be serious.

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,219
It has to be serious.

72
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,819
So usually, if somebody says, hey, can we talk?

73
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,360
It means that there's going to be a serious topic.

74
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,960
It's going to be probably bad news.

75
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,139
Maybe bad news.

76
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,979
So can we talk?

77
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,400
So if your boyfriend or girlfriend tells you this, well, it's not a good sign.

78
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:00,960
That's right.

79
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:01,759
All right.

80
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,219
And the last phrase that we have on Fluency Builder, you know what I mean.

81
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,580
You know what I mean.

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,979
You know what I mean.

83
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,280
You know what I mean.

84
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:10,960
All right.

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,199
So, again, this phrase is very simple to understand, right?

86
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:14,800
That's right.

87
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,519
So you know what I'm talking about.

88
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,379
You understand me.

89
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,040
But the interesting thing is that we can also make it a question.

90
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:28,199
And it's all about the change in tone.

91
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:38,759
OK, so with this in mind, let's listen to two examples of the same phrase, but with different tones, and you try to see which one is the question.

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
Example one.

93
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,220
I'm tired of doing nothing all day here at home.

94
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:46,980
You know what I mean?

95
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:50,980
Example two.

96
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,639
Come on, Charles.

97
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,300
You know what I mean when I say that I don't like your friends.

98
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,639
Example three.

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,420
I hate this class.

100
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:03,779
It's so boring and tedious.

101
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:05,100
You know what I mean?

102
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,079
All right.

103
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:14,459
So we heard the examples and, well, maybe you guessed it right, the second example was the question.

104
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:14,879
That's right.

105
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,699
You know what I mean?

106
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,300
Right.

107
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,899
So basically you're asking the person if they understand your idea or they understand what you're talking about.

108
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,500
So maybe you can say, the professor wasn't very clear on his instruction, so how was I supposed to do the homework?

109
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,199
You know what I mean?

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,500
So you're asking me to confirm that I understand you.

111
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,100
My idea.

112
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,180
You understand what I'm saying?

113
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:33,920
OK.

114
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,939
And if it was a statement, I might say, hey, I don't like going to your mom's house.

115
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,100
So I would say, what?

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,819
What do you mean?

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,160
Why?

118
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,500
You know what I mean.

119
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:42,879
Right.

120
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,199
So I perfectly understand or know the reasons why you don't like going to my mom's house.

121
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,259
Like I don't have to tell you.

122
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:49,160
You know what I mean.

123
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:49,879
All right.

124
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,420
Very good.

125
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,180
So you know what I mean.

126
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,540
Great.

127
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,720
So we've taken a look at these four phrases.

128
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,459
They're very simple, but the way that you use them gives them different meanings.

129
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,160
That's right.

130
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,060
All right.

131
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,660
So let's listen to our dialogue for the second time.

132
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,480
Let's slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

133
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,339
Can we talk?

134
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:16,879
Sure, honey.

135
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,259
We're talking now, aren't we?

136
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,939
You know what I mean.

137
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, I know.

138
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,060
I want to know where this relationship is going.

139
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,579
I'm in love with you and I need to know, you know, I think you're awesome.

140
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,199
I'm awesome.

141
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,980
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

142
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,279
Honey.

143
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:39,420
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

144
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:39,860
All right.

145
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,819
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate, well, maybe it's just time we baby.

146
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,360
I love you so much.

147
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,000
You do.

148
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,800
I love you.

149
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,379
And I think you're awesome.

150
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,360
Oh, I love you too.

151
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:52,860
Come on.

152
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,860
Put the gun down.

153
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,759
Oh, baby.

154
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,459
I'm so sorry.

155
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:00,779
Okay.

156
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:06,500
So now it's time for us to take a look at some more phrases, but this time we're going to look at them in putting it together.

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,480
Okay.

158
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,480
We're going to see how we can use these phrases in a few different situations.

159
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:22,540
So the girl wanted to talk to her boyfriend because she wanted to know where this relationship is going.

160
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:23,120
Right.

161
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,300
Where is this relationship going?

162
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,300
Where is this relationship going?

163
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:33,279
So she wants to know what's going to happen or what's the future of this relationship.

164
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,920
Are we going to get married or just what's happening?

165
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:40,399
So why don't we listen to some examples with different nouns and how we can use this phrase.

166
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,360
Example one.

167
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,660
I don't know where my career is going in this company.

168
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,199
I don't see any potential for growth.

169
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,339
Example two.

170
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,720
This movie is so confusing.

171
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,879
I have no idea where the plot is going.

172
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,959
Example three.

173
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,720
We have been in this meeting for over two hours and I still don't know where it's going.

174
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,939
Okay.

175
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,100
So again, this phrase is just asking about the future of something, right?

176
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,439
So where the future of this movie, where is this movie going?

177
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:16,699
Yeah.

178
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,620
What's happening, right?

179
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,899
What's going to happen?

180
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,240
Yep.

181
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,120
Or your career, et cetera.

182
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,399
Yep.

183
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,060
Okay.

184
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,660
And, and so the girl, um, you know, she was talking a little bit about her feelings and she said, maybe it's just time we, okay.

185
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,200
So this phrase isn't complete yet.

186
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,500
Yeah.

187
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,679
We need to finish it yet.

188
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,419
But she is basically saying, maybe we should do this.

189
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,000
How can we finish the phrase?

190
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:40,539
All right.

191
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,559
So, so she could say, maybe it's just time we break up.

192
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,120
All right.

193
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,200
Or I can say, maybe it's time we have a baby.

194
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,259
Oh, Marco.

195
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,600
Or even maybe it's time we go home.

196
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:55,200
Okay.

197
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,279
So it's getting late.

198
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:56,860
Let's go home.

199
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,980
Maybe it's time we go home.

200
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:58,240
Yep.

201
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,000
So this is how we can finish this phrase.

202
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,120
And what about our last phrase?

203
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,419
So she also said, we've had our laughs.

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,100
Okay.

205
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,419
So that means we've had our good times.

206
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,740
Yep.

207
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,460
Okay.

208
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,200
But we can change this to we've had our ups and downs.

209
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:15,659
Okay.

210
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,659
Or we've had our moments.

211
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:18,700
Right.

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,659
So that means we've had our good moments and our bad moments.

213
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,240
That's right.

214
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,799
Or we've had our issues.

215
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,539
Okay.

216
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,659
So that means we've had some problems.

217
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,779
We've had some difficulties.

218
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,019
Or even we've had our moments.

219
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:31,620
Okay.

220
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,279
So that means we've had special times.

221
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:39,299
So that means we've had our special times, special occasions that we will always remember.

222
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:39,820
That's right.

223
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,340
Okay.

224
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:47,860
So three really useful structures that you can change the words a little bit to slightly change the meaning.

225
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:48,600
Okay.

226
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,139
So it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time.

227
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,940
Now we're ready to understand everything.

228
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,360
And then we'll come back and give you some examples of pet names in English.

229
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,519
Can we talk?

230
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,019
Sure, honey.

231
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,360
We're talking now, aren't we?

232
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,059
You know what I mean?

233
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:22,019
Yeah, I know.

234
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,159
I want to know where this relationship is going.

235
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,860
I'm in love with you.

236
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,259
And I need to know...

237
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:31,679
You know, I think you're awesome.

238
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,259
I'm awesome.

239
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,100
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

240
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:36,340
Honey.

241
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,539
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

242
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:40,960
All right.

243
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,659
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate...

244
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:45,960
Maybe it's just time we...

245
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,480
Baby, I love you so much.

246
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,039
You do?

247
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:48,919
I love you.

248
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,460
And I think you're awesome.

249
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,399
Oh, I love you too.

250
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,620
Come on, put the gun down.

251
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,259
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

252
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,019
All right, well, Marco, you mentioned this word pet names.

253
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,799
And what exactly is that?

254
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:09,279
All right.

255
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,320
So pet names aren't names for your dogs or your cats, right?

256
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:12,659
Right.

257
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,340
They are those sweet names that you would call your boyfriend or girlfriend.

258
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:16,720
Okay.

259
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,600
So like baby.

260
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,159
Okay.

261
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,500
In our dialogue, we heard baby.

262
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:19,899
Yep.

263
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,139
Right?

264
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,100
So we're not talking about a little...

265
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,600
A little child.

266
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,360
A little child, no.

267
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,000
Yep.

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,259
This is usually how you would call maybe your girlfriend or boyfriend, baby.

269
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,000
Or honey.

270
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,059
Honey, right?

271
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,679
Hey, honey.

272
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,600
Or, honey, I'm home.

273
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:31,980
Yep.

274
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,299
Right?

275
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,019
But we also have other ones like sweetheart.

276
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,500
Mm-hmm.

277
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,799
Or...

278
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:37,519
Darling.

279
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:37,940
Yeah.

280
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,679
Or what about sweetie?

281
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,399
Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Or cutie.

283
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:42,220
Cutie.

284
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,559
Oh.

285
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,740
So some of these phrases can be a little bit like cheesy.

286
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,539
Maybe like...

287
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah, a little too sweet.

288
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
Too much.

289
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:49,820
Like snookums.

290
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,039
Snookums.

291
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,759
Snookums.

292
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,179
Like snookums.

293
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:53,779
Okay.

294
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:54,879
Or honey bunny.

295
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,700
Oh, yeah.

296
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,500
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,980
We also have sweetie pie.

298
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:58,440
Yep.

299
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:58,779
Yeah.

300
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,240
And some of them will make some up, right?

301
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,159
Maybe they'll call their boyfriend poo bear.

302
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,059
Oh, yeah.

303
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:06,460
Right?

304
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,480
Like Winnie the Pooh, poo bear.

305
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,600
I heard dumpling is a common one.

306
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,100
Also, it could be...

307
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,480
You can make up your own phrase.

308
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,480
You can make up your own pet names, right?

309
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:16,919
Yeah.

310
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,519
So I want to hear from our listeners.

311
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,019
Are there any common pet names in your language?

312
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,039
I know that in Spanish, we sometimes call the...

313
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:32,279
We can sometimes call our girlfriend gorda, which actually means fat, but it's not in a bad way.

314
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:32,600
Really?

315
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:35,779
It's a sweet way of calling your girlfriend.

316
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,620
And I know in French, you can say ma puce, which basically means my flea.

317
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,820
Yeah, so some of them, if you translate, you wouldn't really use in English, but let us know.

318
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:52,820
Translate from your language or other ones that you've heard maybe in movies or talk shows, and come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

319
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,639
Leave your questions there, as well as your pet names, and Marco and I are always happy to see you there.

320
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,200
Okay.

321
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,899
Until next time.

322
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,279
Goodbye.

323
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,659
Bye.
