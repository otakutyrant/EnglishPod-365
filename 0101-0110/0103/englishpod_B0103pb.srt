00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we have another romantic lesson, kind of romantic.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A little romantic.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We got a boyfriend and a girlfriend and they're apologizing to each other.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, so it's a very common situation and we're going to be talking about love.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're also going to talk about different pet names that are commonly used in English.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That are used with your boyfriend or girlfriend.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, very good.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, let's listen to this dialogue for the first time and see what's happening with our couple.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Can we talk?

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sure, honey.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We're talking now, aren't we?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You know what I mean.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, I know.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I want to know where this relationship is going.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm in love with you.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And I need to know- You know, I think you're awesome.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm awesome.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Honey.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All right.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate- Well, maybe it's just time we- Baby, I love you so much.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You do?

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I love you and I think you're awesome.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, I love you too.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Come on, put the gun down.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, baby.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, so romantic and dramatic.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, I think she really needed to hear that- Right, so I think she really wanted to hear I love you.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, that's right.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And there's some interesting phrases here in this dialogue.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And today we're going to focus mostly on phrases.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So why don't we start with Fluency Builder.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Fluency Builder.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay, on Fluency Builder today, we are going to take a look at some of these phrases.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And the first one is very important and very different.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So obviously this dialogue is about love and we heard two different ways that this word is used.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And the first one is to love someone.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Right, so he said, I love you.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, I love you.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We all pretty much understand what that means.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Right, but they also mentioned to be in love with someone.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, so he said, I am in love with you.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm in love with you.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In love.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, so what's the difference between to love and to be in love?

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
To be in love with someone means that you have these strong romantic feelings towards somebody.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So you can only be in love with your boyfriend, your girlfriend, your husband or your wife.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So you can love your parents, you can love your family, but you can't be in love with them.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You can only be in love with your girlfriend, boyfriend, husband, wife.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So moving on to the next phrase, now the girl asked her boyfriend, can we talk?

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can we talk?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Can we talk?

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is a very simple sentence.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right, we know the meaning, right?

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But why does she say can we talk?

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, so you use this when you want to start a conversation about something serious.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, so if you wanted to talk to me about my new shirt.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I wouldn't ask, I wouldn't say, hey, Marco, can we talk?

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, I really like your shirt.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where'd you get it?

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Exactly, right.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So it has to be serious.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It has to be serious.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So usually, if somebody says, hey, can we talk?

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It means that there's going to be a serious topic.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's going to be probably bad news.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe bad news.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So can we talk?

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So if your boyfriend or girlfriend tells you this, well, it's not a good sign.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's right.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And the last phrase that we have on Fluency Builder, you know what I mean.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You know what I mean.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You know what I mean.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know what I mean.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
All right.

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So, again, this phrase is very simple to understand, right?

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's right.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So you know what I'm talking about.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You understand me.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But the interesting thing is that we can also make it a question.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And it's all about the change in tone.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
OK, so with this in mind, let's listen to two examples of the same phrase, but with different tones, and you try to see which one is the question.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Example one.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm tired of doing nothing all day here at home.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You know what I mean?

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Example two.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come on, Charles.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You know what I mean when I say that I don't like your friends.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Example three.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I hate this class.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's so boring and tedious.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know what I mean?

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So we heard the examples and, well, maybe you guessed it right, the second example was the question.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right.

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You know what I mean?

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Right.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So basically you're asking the person if they understand your idea or they understand what you're talking about.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So maybe you can say, the professor wasn't very clear on his instruction, so how was I supposed to do the homework?

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know what I mean?

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So you're asking me to confirm that I understand you.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
My idea.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You understand what I'm saying?

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
OK.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And if it was a statement, I might say, hey, I don't like going to your mom's house.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So I would say, what?

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do you mean?

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why?

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You know what I mean.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right.

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So I perfectly understand or know the reasons why you don't like going to my mom's house.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like I don't have to tell you.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You know what I mean.

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Very good.

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So you know what I mean.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Great.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So we've taken a look at these four phrases.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They're very simple, but the way that you use them gives them different meanings.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's right.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All right.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the second time.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's slow it down a little bit and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Can we talk?

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sure, honey.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We're talking now, aren't we?

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You know what I mean.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, I know.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I want to know where this relationship is going.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm in love with you and I need to know, you know, I think you're awesome.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm awesome.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Honey.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate, well, maybe it's just time we baby.

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I love you so much.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You do.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I love you.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And I think you're awesome.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, I love you too.

151
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Come on.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Put the gun down.

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, baby.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm so sorry.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So now it's time for us to take a look at some more phrases, but this time we're going to look at them in putting it together.

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're going to see how we can use these phrases in a few different situations.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So the girl wanted to talk to her boyfriend because she wanted to know where this relationship is going.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Right.

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where is this relationship going?

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Where is this relationship going?

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So she wants to know what's going to happen or what's the future of this relationship.

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are we going to get married or just what's happening?

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So why don't we listen to some examples with different nouns and how we can use this phrase.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Example one.

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know where my career is going in this company.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't see any potential for growth.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Example two.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This movie is so confusing.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have no idea where the plot is going.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Example three.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We have been in this meeting for over two hours and I still don't know where it's going.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So again, this phrase is just asking about the future of something, right?

176
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So where the future of this movie, where is this movie going?

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's happening, right?

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's going to happen?

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yep.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or your career, et cetera.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yep.

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And, and so the girl, um, you know, she was talking a little bit about her feelings and she said, maybe it's just time we, okay.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this phrase isn't complete yet.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We need to finish it yet.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But she is basically saying, maybe we should do this.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How can we finish the phrase?

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All right.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So, so she could say, maybe it's just time we break up.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
All right.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or I can say, maybe it's time we have a baby.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, Marco.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Or even maybe it's time we go home.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay.

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So it's getting late.

198
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's go home.

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Maybe it's time we go home.

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yep.

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So this is how we can finish this phrase.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And what about our last phrase?

203
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So she also said, we've had our laughs.

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

205
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So that means we've had our good times.

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yep.

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But we can change this to we've had our ups and downs.

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

210
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Or we've had our moments.

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Right.

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So that means we've had our good moments and our bad moments.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's right.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Or we've had our issues.

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Okay.

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So that means we've had some problems.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We've had some difficulties.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Or even we've had our moments.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So that means we've had special times.

221
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So that means we've had our special times, special occasions that we will always remember.

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

223
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So three really useful structures that you can change the words a little bit to slightly change the meaning.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So it's time for us to listen to our dialogue for the last time.

227
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Now we're ready to understand everything.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And then we'll come back and give you some examples of pet names in English.

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can we talk?

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sure, honey.

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We're talking now, aren't we?

232
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You know what I mean?

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, I know.

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I want to know where this relationship is going.

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm in love with you.

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I need to know...

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You know, I think you're awesome.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm awesome.

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, I guess that's my answer, isn't it?

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Honey.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Look, if you don't love me, it's not a thing.

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,000
All right.

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We've had our laughs, but I don't appreciate...

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Maybe it's just time we...

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Baby, I love you so much.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You do?

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I love you.

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I think you're awesome.

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, I love you too.

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on, put the gun down.

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
All right, well, Marco, you mentioned this word pet names.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And what exactly is that?

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
All right.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So pet names aren't names for your dogs or your cats, right?

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Right.

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
They are those sweet names that you would call your boyfriend or girlfriend.

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay.

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So like baby.

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay.

261
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In our dialogue, we heard baby.

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yep.

263
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right?

264
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So we're not talking about a little...

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A little child.

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
A little child, no.

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yep.

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is usually how you would call maybe your girlfriend or boyfriend, baby.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Or honey.

270
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Honey, right?

271
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hey, honey.

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Or, honey, I'm home.

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yep.

274
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Right?

275
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But we also have other ones like sweetheart.

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mm-hmm.

277
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Or...

278
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Darling.

279
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Or what about sweetie?

281
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Or cutie.

283
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Cutie.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh.

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So some of these phrases can be a little bit like cheesy.

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Maybe like...

287
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, a little too sweet.

288
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Too much.

289
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Like snookums.

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Snookums.

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Snookums.

292
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Like snookums.

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay.

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Or honey bunny.

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, yeah.

296
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
We also have sweetie pie.

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yep.

299
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah.

300
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And some of them will make some up, right?

301
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Maybe they'll call their boyfriend poo bear.

302
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, yeah.

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Right?

304
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Like Winnie the Pooh, poo bear.

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I heard dumpling is a common one.

306
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Also, it could be...

307
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can make up your own phrase.

308
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can make up your own pet names, right?

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah.

310
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So I want to hear from our listeners.

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are there any common pet names in your language?

312
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I know that in Spanish, we sometimes call the...

313
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We can sometimes call our girlfriend gorda, which actually means fat, but it's not in a bad way.

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Really?

315
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's a sweet way of calling your girlfriend.

316
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And I know in French, you can say ma puce, which basically means my flea.

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, so some of them, if you translate, you wouldn't really use in English, but let us know.

318
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Translate from your language or other ones that you've heard maybe in movies or talk shows, and come to our website, EnglishPod.com.

319
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Leave your questions there, as well as your pet names, and Marco and I are always happy to see you there.

320
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

321
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Until next time.

322
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Goodbye.

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Bye.
