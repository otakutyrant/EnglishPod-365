00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:13,800
EnglishPod.com Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give us some good news.

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:16,000
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,559
Well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:20,859
What?

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,039
Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,480
Well, sir, our sales have dropped.

7
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:27,620
No plunged.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,940
50% in the past month alone.

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,700
We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,439
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid of our staff.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,679
If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages.

12
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:45,960
It's a real mess.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,039
You're crying out loud.

14
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,200
How fast are we losing money?

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:51,259
Um, um, how can I put this?

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,539
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter 11 in less than three months.

17
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:56,920
What?

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:59,560
Jeez, how could this have happened?

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,679
So what's the bad news?

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,500
Oh, that's the really bad news.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,859
Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty.

22
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:14,019
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part, we're going to have to shoulder this cost.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,280
Are you joking?

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,560
Get the supplier on the line now.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
We tried that, sir.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,640
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,439
Well, we're doomed.

29
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,540
There's some really good news, though.

30
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,079
Really?

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:28,760
What?

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,359
I got offered a new job.
