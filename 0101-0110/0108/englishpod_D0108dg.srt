00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:13,000
EnglishPod.com Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give us some good news.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, sir, our sales have dropped.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No plunged.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
50% in the past month alone.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid of our staff.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a real mess.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're crying out loud.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How fast are we losing money?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Um, um, how can I put this?

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter 11 in less than three months.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Jeez, how could this have happened?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So what's the bad news?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, that's the really bad news.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part, we're going to have to shoulder this cost.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you joking?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Get the supplier on the line now.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We tried that, sir.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, we're doomed.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
There's some really good news, though.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Really?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I got offered a new job.
