00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great podcast here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we're going to be bringing you bad news.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Actually, what we're really going to be bringing you is language to talk about bad news.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Exactly.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So maybe you have to give bad news to your boss, to your parents, I don't know, somebody, and we're going to be teaching you how to do this in English.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, obviously it's always difficult to tell somebody bad news, but in your second language it's even harder.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we're going to try and help you today with some great phrases and vocabulary items.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We're not going to preview anything today.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's go directly to our dialogue where we will be in a company and one of the employees is going to be giving bad news to his boss.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So let's listen.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give us some good news.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, sir, our sales have dropped.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No plunged.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
50% in the past month alone.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid of our staff.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If we consider redundancies, it costs us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a real mess.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're crying out loud.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How fast are we losing money?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How can I put this?

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for chapter 11 in less than three months.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What?

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Jeez.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How could this have happened?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, what's the bad news?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, that's the really bad news.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part?

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're going to have to shoulder this cost.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you joking?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Get the supplier on the line now.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We tried that, sir.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, we're doomed.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's some really good news, though.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What?

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I got offered a new job.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All right, it sounds like a pretty tough time for this company, doesn't it?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But good news for the employee.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He won't be jobless.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Well, I guess he knows when to get out.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But why don't we take a look at some of the language now in Language Takeaway?

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Language Takeaway.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So in Language Takeaway today, we have five vocabulary items and, well, let's start with the first one.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right, so the boss, you know, he's talking about the gory details of our disastrous first quarter.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So let's look at the phrase gory details.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All right, so gory details.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Gory details.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This sounds kind of strange.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Gory details.

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It seems very scary.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, the word gory comes from gore, like blood and guts, right?

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Exactly.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's why it sounds a little bit scary to me.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So gory details mean all the little details of a negative or shocking or bad situation.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, so the gory details of the meeting, so all the nasty and negative stuff.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Or you could say the newspaper reported all the gory details of the murder.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, very good.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So gory details.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So the employee was talking about how bad the company was doing, and he mentioned this word redundancies.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Redundancies.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They are considering redundancies.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, so redundancies, again, it's based on the word to be redundant.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
All right, and that means?

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
To not be needed anymore.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, so redundancies are basically firing people.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's well, laying people off.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
People that you don't need anymore, they are redundancies.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, so this is actually a British term, redundancies, to become redundant, because in American English, you would just say layoffs.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yep.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, very good.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
All right, so moving on, they were talking about redundancies, and maybe they should or shouldn't lay some people off, but one of the problems were the regulations governing compensation packages.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so regulations governing compensation packages.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Regulations governing something.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So we have a noun governing noun.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What does that mean?

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
All right, so I think it would help us to understand this a little better if we listen to some examples of this pattern, noun governing noun.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Example one.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't agree with the regulations governing income taxes.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
People shouldn't have to give away their hard-earned money.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Example two.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We need to protect the environment, therefore, there will be new policies governing corporate levels of pollution starting next month.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Example three.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The lack of regulations governing city transportation has led to many traffic accidents.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, great examples, and well, before we move on, this compensation packages, I guess it's all the things that the company gives you when they lay you off, right?

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Right, maybe a certain portion of your retirement benefits or- Like a month's pay, et cetera.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right, compensation packages.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right, so moving on to our next item on language takeaway, we have to shoulder the cost.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
To shoulder the cost.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
All right, so if I shoulder something- You have to carry it.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I carry it?

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's a good one.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So basically, it's the same as the shoulder, your body.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So you carry this cost or you carry this responsibility.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So you might also hear shoulder the burden.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
To shoulder the burden.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yeah.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So it just means to carry the responsibility.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, to share it.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yep.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
All right, interesting.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And we have one more word on language takeaway, and the factory has gone under.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To go under.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
All right, to go under.

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
When something goes under, a company goes under, it goes bankrupt.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It goes bankrupt, so it's not working anymore.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All right, so to go under.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Great vocabulary items here on language takeaway today.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's time for us to move on to the next segment of our show, where we're going to look at some phrases.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So let's start now with fluency builder.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Fluency builder.

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
All right, so we've got some phrases that you can use when somebody's going to tell you some bad news, but also some phrases you can use to deliver bad news.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
All right, so let's start with our first phrase.

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So the boss is getting ready to prepare for this bad news, and he says, lay it on me.

126
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's like, okay, lay it on me.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Lay it on me.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So if I say this, lay it on me, I'm just saying, tell me.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Exactly.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So give me the bad news.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right, so lay it on me.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Very informal, though.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, you're right.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It is kind of informal.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But our next phrase, the boss is hearing about all this bad news, and he says, for crying out loud.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
For crying out loud.

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
For crying out loud.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
All right, so this is a very common phrase of frustration.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Right?

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So why don't we listen to some examples to kind of understand how we use this phrase.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Example one.

143
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
For crying out loud.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
When I tell you to have the report done by Wednesday, that means I expect it to be on my desk by the end of the day.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Example two.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We've got to figure out a new marketing strategy for crying out loud.

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Example three.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
For crying out loud.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You just got your driving license, and you already got in an accident.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So it kind of reminds me of, oh my God.

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So you're frustrated.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're just saying this phrase as, oh my God, or something like this.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, it's like, oh, this is so annoying.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Exactly.

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
For crying out loud.

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yep.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right, moving on to our third phrase.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How can I put this?

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How can I put this?

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So the boss asked him a direct question, and he said, well, how can I put this?

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So we use this phrase, we want to say something maybe a little bit more indirectly.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Right, so you're looking for words of how you can make it softer or more polite.

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Maybe the truth of what you're about to say is a little bit strong, so you want to soften it up a bit.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay, so you say, how can I put this?

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But then you have to complement it with, let's just say that.

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's just say that.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's just say that.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So how do we use this phrase?

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So for example, somebody asks me, well, what do you mean?

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why can't you come on vacation with us?

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I would say, how can I put this?

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's just say that in nine months you will hear the pitter patter of little feet.

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay, so your girlfriend's pregnant.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Exactly.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you're trying, you're not saying my girlfriend is pregnant.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're giving like a metaphor.

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
A metaphor of what's going on, but you don't want to say it directly.

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Another example, I might say, let's just say that Michael isn't doing a great job.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
All right.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So maybe there are very strong reasons or he's doing very, very poorly.

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But I'm just sort of not saying it exactly directly that he's doing bad.

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Very good.

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So it's a phrase that you can actually use a lot and to be a little bit more polite or a little bit more indirect when you're giving somebody some bad news.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Exactly.

191
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Two nice sort of complimenting phrases for delivering bad news.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And why don't we hear them one more time in the dialogue?

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now that we've been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed, give us some good news.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How are things looking for us in terms of sales this month?

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, would you like the bad news first or the really bad news?

196
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What?

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Please, Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news.

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, 50% in the past month alone.

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory or getting rid of our staff.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If we consider redundancies, it costs us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages.

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a real mess.

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're crying out loud.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How fast are we losing money?

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Um, um, how can I put this?

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter 11 in less than three months.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Jeez, how could this have happened?

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So what's the bad news?

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, that's the really bad news.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Our suppliers suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We're going to have to recall all items sold in the last quarter and the worst part?

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We're going to have to shoulder this cost.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Are you joking?

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Get the supplier on the line now.

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They have to assume the cost of this mess.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We tried that, sir.

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country.

219
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, we're doomed.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There is some really good news, though.

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Really?

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What?

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I got offered a new job.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Alright, great.

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So this topic of filing for Chapter 11 is actually very recent, very common now because recently, one of the biggest companies filed for Chapter 11 in the US.

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah, that's right.

227
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But I often get confused by the phrase to file for Chapter 11 versus to file for Chapter 13.

228
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Alright, so in the United States, the bankruptcy law has different chapters or different sections, right?

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And Chapter 11 is basically for companies that run out of money, that go bankrupt, so they have to declare themselves in bankruptcy and so they file for Chapter 11.

230
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But what about Chapter 13?

231
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Chapter 13 is for people.

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Ah, okay.

233
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So people who have large debts, maybe with the car company or the telephone company and they can't pay, they file for Chapter 13.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They say, hey, I don't have money, I can't pay.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Alright, so I guess here it's kind of a metaphor again.

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, it's this phrase to file for Chapter 11 or Chapter 13, meaning bankruptcy.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Right.

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And people will say, personally, that they're filing for Chapter 11.

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Exactly.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Right.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So this is an interesting situation because if you file for bankruptcy in some countries, you can go to jail.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I read recently about this happening in Dubai, actually.

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Exactly.

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So there is prison for debts.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
In the U.S., you don't go to prison for debts.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But what about in your country's, listeners?

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What happens when you go into debt in your country?

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Or what happens when a company goes into bankruptcy?

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let us know.
