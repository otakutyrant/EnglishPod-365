This repository only stores subtitles for EnglishPod 365. You may find the original materials in the linyuanzky/englishpod365 repository.

The subtitles are automatically transcribed using faster-whisper. Unfortunately, they may not be perfect. Some lines might be missing, and some might be misaligned. Therefore, I've begun manually correcting them, which is also a great way to practice English listening. I use Aegisub for this task.

Any corrections are welcome! You can submit a pull request (PR) or send the corrected subtitles directly to me at otakutyrant@gmail.com.

The corrected subtitles are stored in the `fixed` branch.

**Commercial usage or sharing to drive traffic to closed websites are prohibited**, like asking users to follow a WeChat Official Account first.

## Subtitles style guide

Every line should be a valid sentence.

Concatenate some consecutive, easy sentences of the same speaker, like, "Yeah. All right.".

No style decoration.

## About copyright

EnglishPod.com is not running even since 2009. So there is no harm to share materials and subtitles freely here, and just do not use for commerce. I loathe those WeChat Official Account that recommend EnglishPod but ask users to follow it at first before getting the material.
