This repository only stores subtitles for EnglishPod 365. You can find the original materials in the linyuanzky/englishpod365 repository.

The subtitles are automatically transcribed using faster-whisper. Unfortunately, they may not be perfect. Some lines might be missing, and some might be misaligned. Therefore, I've begun manually correcting them, which is also a great way to practice English listening. I use Aegisub for this task.

Any corrections are welcome! You can submit a pull request (PR) or send the corrected subtitles directly to me at otakutyrant@gmail.com.

The corrected subtitles are stored in the `fixed` branch.
