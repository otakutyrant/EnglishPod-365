1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we've got a very nerve-wracking situation for you.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We are going to meet the in-laws.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Meeting the in-laws.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So, who are in-laws?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
These are the parents of your husband or wife.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Right.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So, in this case, you have the mother-in-law and your father-in-law.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So, we're meeting these people for the very first time.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can imagine how nervous the man is, who's meeting his future wife's parents.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's learn all about what they talk about in today's dialogue.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Mother, father, I'd like to introduce you to my fiancé, Bob.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello, Bob.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thanks for having me.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Nice to meet the both of you.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've heard so much.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, Cindy told you about bringing home her last boyfriend then.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ha!

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That idiot.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Shh, Thurston.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're going to scare the poor boy.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Come in and have a drink.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Dinner will be on in just a bit.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What will you be having?

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Whiskey?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Bourbon?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Pick your poison.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you have a lemonade, that'd be great.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Lemonade?

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Why, sure.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There's some in the fridge.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Mother makes her own lemonade from scratch.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's the best.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, what are your hobbies, son?

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you want, we can do some hunting tomorrow.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've just picked up a new rifle I've been meaning to try out.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Should be a real hoot.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Um, I, I, I'm not really, uh, I don't really hunt.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You don't hunt?

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, I'll be damned.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Bob is an animal rights activist.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He doesn't believe in harming animals.

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Dinner's ready.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go out to the patio where the pig is roasting.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Roast pig?

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm a vegetarian.

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Alright, we're back.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So, a very awkward situation.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I think, uh, they might have a little bit of a, of problems in the future.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, there's, there are a lot of cultural differences between the, the characters, the son-in-law and the, the new parents.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The father-in-law.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, uh, it's really interesting.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why don't we, uh, start off by looking at a couple of different words on language takeaway.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Language takeaway.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, first of all, we have, uh, the two characters, Cindy and Bob, who are getting married.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So, we call them, uh, we call Bob Cindy's fiancé.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Right.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, my fiancé.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And it's, uh, it comes from French and it means to the, the person that you're going to get married to.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The person you've decided to get married to.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So, we say fiancé.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We can say the same word for a man or a woman.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, he is my fiancé.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She is my fiancé.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My fiancé.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Very good.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, Cindy introduces her fiancé, Bob, to her parents and they start talking a little bit and her dad, Thurston, invites him to go do some hunting tomorrow.

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right.

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, hunting is a sport in America and lots of places in the world where you shoot animals.

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, you go in the woods, you wear brown and green colors and you shoot animals to take them home and skin them and eat them.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Right.

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or to keep them as trophies.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
All right.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, you go hunting and, well, the way that you shoot these animals is you need to have a rifle.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
A rifle.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, you could also call it a hunting rifle in this case.

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A rifle is a gun, but it's a very long gun.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, it's not a little gun that you just hold in your hand.

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a, it's very long.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It'll be maybe like half a meter, a meter long.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's right.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And so, oftentimes people, when they're hunting, they lie on the ground and they wait for the animals to pass and they hide themselves and then they shoot from a long distance.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So, he's talking about hunting.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's got a new rifle and he says, yeah, we should definitely go.

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It should be a real hoot.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Should be a real hoot.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is a very fun spoken English phrase.

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's said more by older people than by younger people.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, this is why the father says it in the dialogue.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A hoot should be a real good time, real fun, a hoot.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, how can you, can you use this like, oh, the party last night was a real hoot.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yep.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can say that.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can say, or, she's a real hoot.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She's really funny.

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You know, she's really enjoyable.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is a little bit more, like, spoken and used by maybe older people, right?

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My mother would say this.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I wouldn't say this.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, oh my goodness, it was a real hoot.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
All right.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, he's talking about hunting, how much fun they would have and, unfortunately, Bob is an animal rights activist.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What does this mean?

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So, an animal rights activist is someone who is very concerned with protecting the rights of animals.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, for example, if I'm an animal rights activist, maybe I will protest people who wear fur.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Or perhaps I will also try and secure land for a natural wildlife preserve so that animals can live in the wild.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There's not houses or cars.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So, animal rights activists are people who try to make sure that animals are protected from human beings.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Very good.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And this is what Bob is.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, obviously, Bob is not really into hunting, right?

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm guessing, no.

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
These are two opposites.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You have people who like to kill animals and people who want to protect the lives of animals.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, and to finish off our language takeaway, dinner is ready.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So, let's go out to the patio.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A patio is a space outside the house, usually in the back, that's paved.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So, there's like cement or bricks or some kind of tile.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And that's where you have a table and chairs or some place to sit and rest.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is where you have a grill.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, it's an outdoor area, but it's not grass.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, it's not your backyard.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Or it could be in your backyard.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The patio could be in the backyard.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's right.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But the ground in the patio is not grass.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's some kind of material like cement or brick.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Or wood.

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Very good.

145
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So, great words there.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Fluency Builder.

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All right.

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We're back.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So, we have three great phrases here on Fluency Builder.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why don't we start off with the first one?

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, the first one, we have to go back to the very beginning of this dialogue and think about these people who are introducing each other for the very first time.

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Cindy says, I want to introduce you to my fiancé, Bob.

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Bob says to Cindy's parents, I've heard so much.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I've heard so much.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So, this phrase, you can usually use it when you meet somebody for the first time.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I've heard so much about you.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's right.

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So, the longer version is I've heard so much about you.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Basically, you're saying, listen, Cindy talks about you a lot.

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've heard really nice things.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Sometimes people like to joke.

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You say, I've heard so much about you.

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They say, I hope only good things.

167
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I hope not too much.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I hope not too much.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So, this is a very polite way to respond when someone introduces themselves.

170
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

171
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've heard so much about you.

172
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So, they started talking and actually Thurston offers him a drink.

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He says, well, what do you want?

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Whiskey, bourbon, pick your poison.

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
All right.

178
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is one of my very favorite phrases in English.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The father-in-law wants to give the new son-in-law a drink.

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And there are many different options.

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So, pick your poison means pick your drink.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You might hear this at a bar.

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What do you want to drink?

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Pick your poison.

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right.

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You could have whiskey, rum.

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So, usually we're just talking about alcoholic drinks.

188
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, you wouldn't really use this for juices or water or something like that.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is for alcohol.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay.

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, if you say pick your poison, that's for alcohol, right?

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Or maybe you can ask somebody what they're drinking.

193
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You would say, what's your poison?

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What's your poison?

196
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay.

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So, poison in this case is a slang term for alcohol.

198
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Very good.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And finally, when Cindy was talking about lemonade that her mother makes, she said she makes it from scratch, to make something from scratch.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You could say, my mother makes chocolate chip cookies from scratch.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This means not to buy something in the store, but to make it all yourself from nothing.

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So, making lemonade from scratch means taking lemons, cutting them, taking the juice, adding some sugar.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So, you're making it from nothing.

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're not using some kind of kit or some kind of canned drink from the store.

205
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

206
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, for example, maybe some Italians in Italy make their spaghetti from scratch with flour and they knead it and they make everything from scratch.

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Wow.

208
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So, you don't buy a box of spaghetti, but you actually have to cut the spaghetti and pull it.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Exactly.

210
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Very, very hard work.

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So, to make something from scratch.

212
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And usually you can add the something goes in between, right, to make lemonade from scratch, make bread from scratch.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Make ice cream from scratch.

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So, those are our three phrases for today.

216
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's listen to the dialogue for one last time and we'll be back to talk about this very, very interesting topic.

217
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mother, father, I'd like to introduce you to my fiancé Bob.

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hello, Bob.

219
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Welcome.

220
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thanks for having me.

221
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Nice to meet the both of you.

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've heard so much.

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So, Cindy told you about bringing home her last boyfriend then.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ha, that idiot.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Shh, Thurston.

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You're going to scare the poor boy.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Come in and have a drink.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Dinner will be on in just a bit.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What will you be having?

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Whiskey, bourbon, pick your poison.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you have a lemonade, that'd be great.

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Boy, sure, there's some in the fridge.

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Mother makes her own lemonade from scratch.

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's the best.

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So, what are your hobbies, son?

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If you want, we can do some hunting tomorrow.

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I've just picked up a new rifle I've been meaning to try out.

238
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Should be a real hoot.

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not really, I don't really hunt.

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You don't hunt?

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, I'll be damned.

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Bob is an animal rights activist.

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He doesn't believe in harming animals.

244
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Dinner's ready.

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's go out to the patio where the pig is roasting.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Roast pig?

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm a vegetarian.

248
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This is a very scary topic for a lot of people.

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think they get very nervous introducing themselves because in this case, Bob is going to be marrying Cindy.

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So, these are going to be his in-laws forever.

251
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, and it seems interesting the differences, as you mentioned before, between the father-in-law who's very much into hunting and drinks and likes roast pig, whereas this guy is more of an animal rights activist, doesn't drink.

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's a vegetarian.

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He doesn't eat meat.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So, I think it would be very complicated, and I think this happens a lot also with people from different cultures, right?

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Maybe you're Asian and you're marrying an American or something like this.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, that's right.

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I think it can be very, very difficult.

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I recently went to a wedding between a Chinese girl and an American guy, and it was amazing to see all these people getting together because the families were so different.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But they all got along really well.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was really fun.

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They were all very supportive.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They were just excited for their kids.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah, but I think it can be a little bit difficult, right?

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I mean, being in a family where the culture is so different or the traditions and the customs are strange to you.

265
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But it's exciting because then as a family, the young people who are getting married, they can pick the traditions they want and make new traditions.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So this is a very interesting topic.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We want to know maybe if you are married, how did it go when you met your in-laws?

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you very different or did you get along very well?

269
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or how is it in your country?

270
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, please do let us know.

271
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

272
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We hope to see you there.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
All right, everyone.

274
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Bye.

275
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Bye.
