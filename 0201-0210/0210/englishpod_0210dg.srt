EnglishPod.com Mother, father, I'd like to introduce you to my fiancÃ© Bob.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Bob.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Welcome.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Nice to meet the both of you.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I've heard so much.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, Cindy told you about bringing home her last boyfriend then.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ha!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That idiot.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Shh!

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thurston!

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're going to scare the poor boy.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Come in and have a drink.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Dinner will be on in just a bit.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What'll you be having?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Whiskey?

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bourbon?

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Pick your poison.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you have a lemonade, that'd be great.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Lemonade?

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why, sure.

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There's some in the fridge.

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Mother makes her own lemonade from scratch.

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's the best.

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, what are your hobbies, son?

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you want, we can do some hunting tomorrow.

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've just picked up a new rifle I've been meaning to try out.

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Should be a real hoot.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Um, I'm not really, uh, I don't really hunt.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't hunt?

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, I'll be damned.

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Bob is an animal rights activist.

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He doesn't believe in harming animals.

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Dinner's ready.

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's go out to the patio where the pig is roasting.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Roast pig?

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm a vegetarian.
