EnglishPod.com Mother, father, I'd like to introduce you to my fiancÃ© Bob.

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,339
Hello, Bob.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:12,880
Welcome.

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,380
Thanks for having me.

5
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:15,800
Nice to meet the both of you.

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,940
I've heard so much.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,039
So, Cindy told you about bringing home her last boyfriend then.

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:21,699
Ha!

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:22,500
That idiot.

10
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:23,019
Shh!

11
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:23,460
Thurston!

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,160
You're going to scare the poor boy.

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,660
Come in and have a drink.

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,219
Dinner will be on in just a bit.

15
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,480
What'll you be having?

16
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:30,440
Whiskey?

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:30,899
Bourbon?

18
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:31,960
Pick your poison.

19
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,979
If you have a lemonade, that'd be great.

20
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:35,759
Lemonade?

21
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:36,359
Why, sure.

22
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,359
There's some in the fridge.

23
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,840
Mother makes her own lemonade from scratch.

24
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:40,859
It's the best.

25
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:42,820
So, what are your hobbies, son?

26
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,020
If you want, we can do some hunting tomorrow.

27
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,859
I've just picked up a new rifle I've been meaning to try out.

28
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:48,700
Should be a real hoot.

29
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:52,780
Um, I'm not really, uh, I don't really hunt.

30
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,000
You don't hunt?

31
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,920
Well, I'll be damned.

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,859
Bob is an animal rights activist.

33
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,740
He doesn't believe in harming animals.

34
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:00,979
Dinner's ready.

35
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,340
Let's go out to the patio where the pig is roasting.

36
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,900
Roast pig?

37
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm a vegetarian.
