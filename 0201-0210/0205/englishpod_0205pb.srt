00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:07,400
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,199
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:12,919
My name is Katherine, and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:13,640
That's right.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,879
We're going to talk a little bit about business, and specifically, we are in a business meeting where we're trying to sell something to someone.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,359
That's right.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,339
So you're going to hear a lot of talk about chocolate, or in this case, gourmet bonbons.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,320
Gourmet bonbons.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,659
Gourmet bonbons is another word for chocolate candies or candies.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,979
Okay, so a bonbon is kind of like round usually, right?

11
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,060
Usually, yes.

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:37,520
Okay.

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,820
All right, so let's get started and listen to today's dialogue.

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,119
We'll be back in a moment.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,159
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Johnson.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,079
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,539
The ambience here is lovely.

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:58,840
No problem.

20
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:02,140
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,939
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,680
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grengers Gourmet Bonbons here in the United States.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,180
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,379
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:32,359
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grengers, and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first-class dining.

26
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,959
Hmm, sounds interesting, gourmet chocolates.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,500
Where are they produced?

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:37,980
Belgium?

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,219
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

30
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:42,280
Really?

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,700
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,420
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:02:00,019
The government is 100% supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,519
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

35
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,040
Here, I brought these especially for you.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,879
Try one.

37
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:08,139
Oh, thanks.

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
Mmm, mmm.

39
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,280
Creamy texture.

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,860
Very smooth.

41
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,219
Unique, aren't they?

42
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,659
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

43
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:23,159
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients.

44
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:26,460
Yes, only the crème de la crème make it through inspection.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,139
Yes, very interesting flavors, slightly spicy.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,759
Hmm, very unique, that's for sure.

47
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,860
Exactly what are the ingredients?

48
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:43,020
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations.

49
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,039
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,219
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

51
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,280
Haggis?

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,960
What's haggis?

53
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,900
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

54
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,879
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung, and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

55
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,219
Blech!

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,080
Blech!

57
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:05,699
Blech!

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,120
Blech!

59
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,120
I'll get back to you.

60
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,460
Mr.

61
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:09,879
Johnson?

62
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,539
Mr.

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:10,919
Johnson!

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,439
Alright, we're back.

65
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,560
So, a lot of interesting vocab there.

66
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:30,020
The guy was trying to convince him about these chocolates, but it turned out to be something a little bit strange, and we'll talk about that in a little while.

67
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,520
Before we get into that, why don't we take a look at seven key words that we have prepared for you today on Language Takeaway.

68
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,539
Language Takeaway Okay, so we've divided Language Takeaway into two parts today.

69
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,879
The first part is all about business and manufacturing.

70
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,539
So, what's our first word, Marco?

71
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,259
Alright, so the guy talked about being the sole distributor for this company called Granger's Gourmet Bon-Bons.

72
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,840
Okay, a distributor.

73
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:08,139
Okay, this is a person or a company, and the distributor is someone who distributes or sells a product, right?

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,500
Right, so the factory will make them.

75
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:18,319
He will get all these goods from the factory, and then he will be the one that gives it to the different retail stores.

76
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,000
So, he can have many clients, and he is the main person who you get it from.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,120
So, obviously, they don't get it directly from the factory.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,899
Okay, so this person, a distributor or a company, is in the middle of the transaction.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,240
On one side, there is the manufacturer, and on the other side, there is the retail market or stores.

80
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,660
Exactly, and as you said, that's our second key word today, manufacturer.

81
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,019
Okay, manufacturer, again, is a person or company that makes a good.

82
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,899
So, for example, a television manufacturer makes TV.

83
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,779
It's like a factory.

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,620
Exactly, so they manufacture things.

85
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,459
They make them.

86
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:57,959
All right, so we've got distributors who are moving goods.

87
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,480
We have manufacturers who are making them, but what happens when we want to move a good out of a country?

88
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,879
Okay, so that is our third word for today.

89
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,860
Usually in customs, we have to pay a tariff for these goods or a tax.

90
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:22,360
Okay, so a tariff is a special kind of tax that you pay when you are trying to export or send outside of your country goods that you've made in that country.

91
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:30,779
So for example, if I make 100 TVs in America, but I want to sell these TVs to someone in Mexico, I have to pay a tariff.

92
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:38,339
I have to pay like $10 to the government that allows me to send these out of the country.

93
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,779
That's right, so that is a tariff.

94
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:53,319
And now when he was talking about tariffs and how the government is reducing the tariffs in order to motivate business, he talked about also that the government is reducing or cutting the red tape.

95
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:58,379
Okay, so he says, listen, they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs.

96
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:09,339
So this means that before they were encountering some problems at customs because customs, you know, there's a lot of paperwork, there's a lot of taxes, there's a lot of information you have to provide.

97
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,639
It's a hassle.

98
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:11,459
It's a lot of work.

99
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,100
A lot of paperwork.

100
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:17,120
Right, so this kind of paperwork, bureaucracy, this is called red tape in English.

101
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:27,800
For example, I would love to get a visa for my foreign husband, but there's a lot of red tape.

102
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,620
There's a lot of work that we have to do.

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,240
There's a lot of bureaucratic processes that you have to do.

104
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:37,740
All right, so red tape, this means a lot of paperwork, a lot of work that you have to do.

105
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,459
Okay, so those are our keywords that are related to business.

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,819
Now let's move on to a couple of different adjectives.

107
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,519
The first one, when he talked about chocolates, he said elegant.

108
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,399
He said that something is elegant.

109
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,040
Okay, elegant.

110
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,339
This is a great adjective.

111
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:57,839
You're going to see this on a lot of luxury brand items.

112
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,399
Elegance means something is elegant if it is classy, if it looks really good and rich.

113
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,459
You could say that dress is very elegant.

114
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,439
That mink coat is very elegant.

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:09,860
Okay.

116
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,100
This is a positive thing.

117
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,519
So something that looks kind of expensive at times as well.

118
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:15,339
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,540
Another word that means looking expensive or elegant is luxurious.

120
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,060
Okay, so luxurious comes from the noun luxury.

121
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,379
That's right, luxury, luxurious.

122
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,579
So we can say that the executive suites at this hotel are very luxurious.

123
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:41,379
They have a jacuzzi, a king-sized bed, expensive silk sheets, the best quality materials.

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,240
So you can say that elegant and luxurious kind of go hand in hand.

125
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,160
That's right.

126
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:56,600
Although elegant, you usually say about someone or their clothing or even a car, but luxurious is more like a place or an object.

127
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,639
Okay, good.

128
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:05,759
And then we have one final word that also describes something that is very rare or very good and rich, a delicacy.

129
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,480
Yeah, actually this one is a noun.

130
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,139
It's a thing.

131
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:13,860
So we can say that this is a Scottish delicacy or what are the delicacies in your country?

132
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,560
So delicacy is something that's special.

133
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:24,800
So for example, you've told me that in Ecuador, there are some interesting food delicacies, little animals.

134
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,680
For example, guinea pigs.

135
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,740
Well, they're not really a delicacy, although kind of because guinea pigs are expensive comparatively to chickens, for example.

136
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,220
So it is considered to be something that you only eat on special occasions.

137
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:46,080
And in East Asia, many people consider shark's fin soup to be a delicacy, a special dish.

138
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:54,519
So we can say that it's usually about food and it's rare, something that's rare or special or also can be very expensive.

139
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,220
That's right.

140
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,080
A delicacy.

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:56,840
Okay.

142
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,159
So a lot of great, interesting words on language takeaway.

143
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,159
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder.

144
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,159
Fluency builder.

145
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,980
This first phrase is actually something I try to do as often as possible, but it's usually very difficult.

146
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,440
I combine business with pleasure.

147
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:13,919
Right.

148
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,860
To combine business with pleasure.

149
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:25,259
Now this is a whole phrase and this talks about doing business, but at the same time doing it in a fun way or an interesting way.

150
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:25,779
Right.

151
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:30,120
So pleasure here means something that is fun or entertainment even.

152
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:36,559
So for example, going out to dinner with your company is a way to combine business with pleasure.

153
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:43,659
Or meeting a client at a bar is combining business with pleasure.

154
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,379
So you're combining things that are fun and things that are work related.

155
00:09:47,659 --> 00:10:00,620
Because you can have a business meeting in a boardroom or in a meeting room, but if you have the same business meeting at a bar where you're talking and laughing, but also at the same time talking business, then you're combining business with pleasure.

156
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,299
That's right.

157
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,159
And now for our second phrase, it's more about cheating, right?

158
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,159
Somebody that is cheating or maybe not doing things correctly, they are cutting corners.

159
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:11,799
That's right.

160
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,720
So cutting corners is another way to say cheating.

161
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,399
For example, I've seen people, students cutting corners with their studies.

162
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,440
You think about cutting corners, it means that you're not going the long way.

163
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,419
You're cheating by going the shorter way.

164
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,320
You're taking a shortcut.

165
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,200
Taking a shortcut.

166
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:37,860
So for example, instead of studying for that final test in math, some people write the formulas on their hands.

167
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,679
This is a way to cut corners.

168
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:44,000
Instead of studying, you actually cheat by putting it on your hand, making it easier.

169
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,799
So to cut corners is to cheat or to try to take the shortcut, but it kind of has a negative connotation, right?

170
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,379
Oh, definitely.

171
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:53,220
So most people will say, don't cut corners.

172
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,799
In the end, it's not worth it.

173
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,240
Right.

174
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,960
And for our final phrase, we have one that it's in French.

175
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,360
So this one is in French, but it's also a very common English phrase.

176
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,940
That's why we're going to teach it to you.

177
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,759
The crème de la crème.

178
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:07,259
Okay.

179
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,399
So literally in translated from French, that means the cream of the cream.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,179
Right.

181
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,139
But in English, we would say that it's the best of the best.

182
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,100
The best of the best.

183
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:17,919
The very top.

184
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,980
So that's what this phrase means.

185
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,360
The best of the best.

186
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,120
The very top.

187
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,019
The most excellent.

188
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:30,720
So you could say, Harvard University attracts the crème de la crème of American high school students.

189
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,220
Okay.

190
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,580
So the very best of American high school students.

191
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,679
All right.

192
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,720
So that phrase, it's in French, but you can say it in English, right?

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,419
Like fiancé, for example.

194
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,139
Fiancé.

195
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,019
Crème de la crème.

196
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,500
These are all words that we've stolen from French and we use in English.

197
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,299
So don't worry about how you pronounce it.

198
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:49,240
In English, we just say crème de la crème.

199
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:49,879
Okay.

200
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:54,720
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in just a bit.

201
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:03,740
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr.

202
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:04,139
Johnson.

203
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,639
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

204
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,100
The ambience here is lovely.

205
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,419
No problem.

206
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,700
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

207
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,500
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

208
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:24,240
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grengers Gourmet Bon Bons here in the United States.

209
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:28,759
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

210
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,940
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

211
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:43,899
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grengers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious first-class dining.

212
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,120
Hmm.

213
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
Sounds interesting.

214
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,500
Gourmet chocolates.

215
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,059
Where are they produced?

216
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,539
Belgium?

217
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,799
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

218
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:53,840
Really?

219
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,259
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

220
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,000
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

221
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:11,600
The government is 100% supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

222
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,120
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

223
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,600
Here, I brought these especially for you.

224
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:18,419
Try one.

225
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:19,700
Oh, thanks.

226
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,139
Hmm.

227
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,200
Hmm.

228
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,840
Creamy texture.

229
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,399
Very smooth.

230
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,779
Unique, aren't they?

231
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,220
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

232
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,720
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients.

233
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Only the crème de la crème make it through inspection.

234
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:38,779
Yes.

235
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:40,200
Very interesting flavors.

236
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Slightly spicy.

237
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:42,820
Hmm.

238
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,480
Very unique.

239
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,320
That's for sure.

240
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,460
Exactly what are the ingredients?

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,580
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations.

242
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,620
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

243
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:02,779
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

244
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,860
Haggis?

245
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,539
What's haggis?

246
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,480
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

247
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,460
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

248
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,759
Blech.

249
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:16,639
Blech.

250
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,679
I'll get back to you.

251
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,019
Mr.

252
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:21,440
Johnson?

253
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,100
Mr.

254
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,500
Johnson!

255
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,720
All right, we're back.

256
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,059
So now this Scottish delicacy.

257
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,399
What is this haggis?

258
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,460
Haggis.

259
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,080
Haggis.

260
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,539
Okay, haggis, I've never actually eaten it.

261
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,100
It does sound pretty disgusting.

262
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:44,820
It's a Scottish delicacy that I think involves stuffing...

263
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,320
Like what?

264
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:45,860
What do we hear?

265
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:46,519
Pig liver?

266
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,679
Let's see this again.

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,960
So basically, you take a sheep's liver, a heart, and a lung, and you put it inside the sheep's stomach.

268
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:55,399
And you serve that.

269
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,379
And you cook it.

270
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,179
Yeah, you cook it like that.

271
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:57,759
You cook it.

272
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,480
And so it's like all the insides of a sheep.

273
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:02,440
Yeah.

274
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,100
It kind of sounds disgusting, but I'm pretty sure it tastes pretty good.

275
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,360
It probably tastes good.

276
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,620
Because it's a Scottish delicacy, so...

277
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,059
Yeah, I don't know.

278
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,539
Although I cannot imagine eating it in a chocolate.

279
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,980
This is disgusting.

280
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:30,840
I've heard of countries where they take a chicken, they stuff it with something, like they have a stuffing, and then they put the chicken inside a goat, and then the goat inside a bigger animal, and then they cook all that together.

281
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,539
Oh, wow.

282
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:41,299
And then you have this amazing, you know, obviously it's huge, they use these big brick ovens to cook them, but you have this platter with like three different types of meats.

283
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,779
Oh, wow, we have that in America.

284
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:43,279
Really?

285
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,539
It's called a turducken.

286
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:45,500
Turducken.

287
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:48,279
Turkey, ducken, turkey, duck, and chicken.

288
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:53,419
So you have a chicken inside of a duck, which you put inside of a turkey.

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,100
Turkey, wow.

290
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,960
And you bake it.

291
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:56,259
Wow, how does it taste?

292
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:56,759
Delicious.

293
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,059
It's a very special taste.

294
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,419
Exactly.

295
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,940
So I'm curious to know what your national delicacy is.

296
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:04,879
Do you have a delicacy in your home country?

297
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,059
Let us know on EnglishPod.com.

298
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:13,460
We're always curious to talk about food, but we would love to have you practicing on the website and asking any questions that you may have.

299
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,000
That's right.

300
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,960
So we'll see everyone there.

301
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,960
Until next time.

302
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:16,220
Bye.

303
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:16,519
Bye.
