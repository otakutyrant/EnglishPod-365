00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine, and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to talk a little bit about business, and specifically, we are in a business meeting where we're trying to sell something to someone.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So you're going to hear a lot of talk about chocolate, or in this case, gourmet bonbons.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Gourmet bonbons.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Gourmet bonbons is another word for chocolate candies or candies.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, so a bonbon is kind of like round usually, right?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Usually, yes.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Okay.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right, so let's get started and listen to today's dialogue.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We'll be back in a moment.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Johnson.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The ambience here is lovely.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No problem.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grengers Gourmet Bonbons here in the United States.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grengers, and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first-class dining.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hmm, sounds interesting, gourmet chocolates.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Where are they produced?

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Belgium?

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really?

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The government is 100% supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here, I brought these especially for you.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Try one.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, thanks.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Mmm, mmm.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Creamy texture.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Very smooth.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Unique, aren't they?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, only the crème de la crème make it through inspection.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, very interesting flavors, slightly spicy.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hmm, very unique, that's for sure.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Exactly what are the ingredients?

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Haggis?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's haggis?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung, and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Blech!

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Blech!

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Blech!

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Blech!

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll get back to you.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Mr.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Johnson?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mr.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Johnson!

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alright, we're back.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So, a lot of interesting vocab there.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The guy was trying to convince him about these chocolates, but it turned out to be something a little bit strange, and we'll talk about that in a little while.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Before we get into that, why don't we take a look at seven key words that we have prepared for you today on Language Takeaway.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Language Takeaway Okay, so we've divided Language Takeaway into two parts today.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The first part is all about business and manufacturing.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So, what's our first word, Marco?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Alright, so the guy talked about being the sole distributor for this company called Granger's Gourmet Bon-Bons.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, a distributor.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, this is a person or a company, and the distributor is someone who distributes or sells a product, right?

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right, so the factory will make them.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He will get all these goods from the factory, and then he will be the one that gives it to the different retail stores.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, he can have many clients, and he is the main person who you get it from.

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, obviously, they don't get it directly from the factory.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, so this person, a distributor or a company, is in the middle of the transaction.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
On one side, there is the manufacturer, and on the other side, there is the retail market or stores.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Exactly, and as you said, that's our second key word today, manufacturer.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, manufacturer, again, is a person or company that makes a good.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, for example, a television manufacturer makes TV.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's like a factory.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Exactly, so they manufacture things.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They make them.

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
All right, so we've got distributors who are moving goods.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We have manufacturers who are making them, but what happens when we want to move a good out of a country?

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay, so that is our third word for today.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Usually in customs, we have to pay a tariff for these goods or a tax.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so a tariff is a special kind of tax that you pay when you are trying to export or send outside of your country goods that you've made in that country.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So for example, if I make 100 TVs in America, but I want to sell these TVs to someone in Mexico, I have to pay a tariff.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have to pay like $10 to the government that allows me to send these out of the country.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's right, so that is a tariff.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And now when he was talking about tariffs and how the government is reducing the tariffs in order to motivate business, he talked about also that the government is reducing or cutting the red tape.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, so he says, listen, they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So this means that before they were encountering some problems at customs because customs, you know, there's a lot of paperwork, there's a lot of taxes, there's a lot of information you have to provide.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a hassle.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a lot of work.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A lot of paperwork.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Right, so this kind of paperwork, bureaucracy, this is called red tape in English.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
For example, I would love to get a visa for my foreign husband, but there's a lot of red tape.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's a lot of work that we have to do.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's a lot of bureaucratic processes that you have to do.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right, so red tape, this means a lot of paperwork, a lot of work that you have to do.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, so those are our keywords that are related to business.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now let's move on to a couple of different adjectives.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The first one, when he talked about chocolates, he said elegant.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He said that something is elegant.

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay, elegant.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is a great adjective.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're going to see this on a lot of luxury brand items.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Elegance means something is elegant if it is classy, if it looks really good and rich.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You could say that dress is very elegant.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That mink coat is very elegant.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is a positive thing.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So something that looks kind of expensive at times as well.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Another word that means looking expensive or elegant is luxurious.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, so luxurious comes from the noun luxury.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right, luxury, luxurious.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So we can say that the executive suites at this hotel are very luxurious.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
They have a jacuzzi, a king-sized bed, expensive silk sheets, the best quality materials.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So you can say that elegant and luxurious kind of go hand in hand.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Although elegant, you usually say about someone or their clothing or even a car, but luxurious is more like a place or an object.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, good.

128
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And then we have one final word that also describes something that is very rare or very good and rich, a delicacy.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, actually this one is a noun.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a thing.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So we can say that this is a Scottish delicacy or what are the delicacies in your country?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So delicacy is something that's special.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So for example, you've told me that in Ecuador, there are some interesting food delicacies, little animals.

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
For example, guinea pigs.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, they're not really a delicacy, although kind of because guinea pigs are expensive comparatively to chickens, for example.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So it is considered to be something that you only eat on special occasions.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And in East Asia, many people consider shark's fin soup to be a delicacy, a special dish.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So we can say that it's usually about food and it's rare, something that's rare or special or also can be very expensive.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's right.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
A delicacy.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Okay.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So a lot of great, interesting words on language takeaway.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why don't we move on now to fluency builder.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Fluency builder.

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This first phrase is actually something I try to do as often as possible, but it's usually very difficult.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I combine business with pleasure.

147
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Right.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
To combine business with pleasure.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now this is a whole phrase and this talks about doing business, but at the same time doing it in a fun way or an interesting way.

150
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Right.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So pleasure here means something that is fun or entertainment even.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So for example, going out to dinner with your company is a way to combine business with pleasure.

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Or meeting a client at a bar is combining business with pleasure.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So you're combining things that are fun and things that are work related.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because you can have a business meeting in a boardroom or in a meeting room, but if you have the same business meeting at a bar where you're talking and laughing, but also at the same time talking business, then you're combining business with pleasure.

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And now for our second phrase, it's more about cheating, right?

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Somebody that is cheating or maybe not doing things correctly, they are cutting corners.

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's right.

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So cutting corners is another way to say cheating.

161
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For example, I've seen people, students cutting corners with their studies.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You think about cutting corners, it means that you're not going the long way.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You're cheating by going the shorter way.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're taking a shortcut.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Taking a shortcut.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So for example, instead of studying for that final test in math, some people write the formulas on their hands.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is a way to cut corners.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Instead of studying, you actually cheat by putting it on your hand, making it easier.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So to cut corners is to cheat or to try to take the shortcut, but it kind of has a negative connotation, right?

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, definitely.

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So most people will say, don't cut corners.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In the end, it's not worth it.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Right.

174
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And for our final phrase, we have one that it's in French.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So this one is in French, but it's also a very common English phrase.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's why we're going to teach it to you.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The crème de la crème.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So literally in translated from French, that means the cream of the cream.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Right.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But in English, we would say that it's the best of the best.

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The best of the best.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The very top.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So that's what this phrase means.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The best of the best.

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The very top.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The most excellent.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So you could say, Harvard University attracts the crème de la crème of American high school students.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So the very best of American high school students.

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
All right.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So that phrase, it's in French, but you can say it in English, right?

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like fiancé, for example.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Fiancé.

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Crème de la crème.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
These are all words that we've stolen from French and we use in English.

197
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So don't worry about how you pronounce it.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
In English, we just say crème de la crème.

199
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Okay.

200
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in just a bit.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr.

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Johnson.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

204
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The ambience here is lovely.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No problem.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grengers Gourmet Bon Bons here in the United States.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

211
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grengers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious first-class dining.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hmm.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Sounds interesting.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Gourmet chocolates.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Where are they produced?

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Belgium?

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

218
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Really?

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

220
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The government is 100% supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Here, I brought these especially for you.

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Try one.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, thanks.

226
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hmm.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hmm.

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Creamy texture.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Very smooth.

230
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Unique, aren't they?

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Only the crème de la crème make it through inspection.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Very interesting flavors.

236
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Slightly spicy.

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hmm.

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Very unique.

239
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's for sure.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Exactly what are the ingredients?

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations.

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Haggis?

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What's haggis?

246
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Blech.

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Blech.

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll get back to you.

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Mr.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Johnson?

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mr.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Johnson!

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All right, we're back.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So now this Scottish delicacy.

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is this haggis?

258
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Haggis.

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Haggis.

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay, haggis, I've never actually eaten it.

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It does sound pretty disgusting.

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's a Scottish delicacy that I think involves stuffing...

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like what?

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What do we hear?

265
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Pig liver?

266
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's see this again.

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So basically, you take a sheep's liver, a heart, and a lung, and you put it inside the sheep's stomach.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And you serve that.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And you cook it.

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yeah, you cook it like that.

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You cook it.

272
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And so it's like all the insides of a sheep.

273
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah.

274
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It kind of sounds disgusting, but I'm pretty sure it tastes pretty good.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It probably tastes good.

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because it's a Scottish delicacy, so...

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, I don't know.

278
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Although I cannot imagine eating it in a chocolate.

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This is disgusting.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I've heard of countries where they take a chicken, they stuff it with something, like they have a stuffing, and then they put the chicken inside a goat, and then the goat inside a bigger animal, and then they cook all that together.

281
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Oh, wow.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then you have this amazing, you know, obviously it's huge, they use these big brick ovens to cook them, but you have this platter with like three different types of meats.

283
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, wow, we have that in America.

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Really?

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's called a turducken.

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Turducken.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Turkey, ducken, turkey, duck, and chicken.

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So you have a chicken inside of a duck, which you put inside of a turkey.

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Turkey, wow.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And you bake it.

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Wow, how does it taste?

292
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Delicious.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's a very special taste.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Exactly.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So I'm curious to know what your national delicacy is.

296
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you have a delicacy in your home country?

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let us know on EnglishPod.com.

298
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We're always curious to talk about food, but we would love to have you practicing on the website and asking any questions that you may have.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's right.

300
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So we'll see everyone there.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Until next time.

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Bye.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Bye.
