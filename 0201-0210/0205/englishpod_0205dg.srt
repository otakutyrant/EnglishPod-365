00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:12,000
EnglishPod.com I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Johnson.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The ambience here is lovely.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No problem.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grengers Gourmet Bon Bons here in the United States.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grengers, and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first-class dining.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hmm, sounds interesting.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Gourmet chocolates.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Where are they produced?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Belgium?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Really?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The government is 100 percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Here, I brought these especially for you.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Try one.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, thanks.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hmm.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Creamy texture.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Very smooth.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Unique, aren't they?

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Only the crème de la crème make it through inspection.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, very interesting flavors.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Slightly spicy.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hmm, very unique, that's for sure.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Exactly what are the ingredients?

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Haggis?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's haggis?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung, and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll get back to you.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mr.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Johnson?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mr.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Johnson!
