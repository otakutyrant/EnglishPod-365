00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:12,179
EnglishPod.com I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:12,560
Johnson.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,079
I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,519
The ambience here is lovely.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,859
No problem.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,140
If possible, I always combine business with pleasure.

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,940
Now let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.

8
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:32,679
Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grengers Gourmet Bon Bons here in the United States.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,179
They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,359
Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:52,320
I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grengers, and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first-class dining.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,659
Hmm, sounds interesting.

13
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,920
Gourmet chocolates.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,500
Where are they produced?

15
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,000
Belgium?

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,219
Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,259
Really?

18
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,700
I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production.

19
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:09,420
That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity.

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:20,000
The government is 100 percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over 1,000 units.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,540
They've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,040
Here, I brought these especially for you.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,859
Try one.

24
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,140
Oh, thanks.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,560
Hmm.

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,260
Creamy texture.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,840
Very smooth.

28
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,200
Unique, aren't they?

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,640
I bet you've never tasted anything like it.

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,140
Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients.

31
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:46,439
Only the crème de la crème make it through inspection.

32
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,700
Yes, very interesting flavors.

33
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,120
Slightly spicy.

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,760
Hmm, very unique, that's for sure.

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,859
Exactly what are the ingredients?

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:03,019
I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations.

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,060
I'm sure you can keep a secret.

38
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,219
Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar, and haggis.

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,280
Haggis?

40
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:14,960
What's haggis?

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,900
It's a traditional Scottish delicacy.

42
00:02:18,419 --> 00:02:22,879
You take sheep's liver, heart, and lung, and stuff it inside the sheep's stomach.

43
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,099
I'll get back to you.

44
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:29,439
Mr.

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:29,879
Johnson?

46
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:30,520
Mr.

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:30,919
Johnson!
