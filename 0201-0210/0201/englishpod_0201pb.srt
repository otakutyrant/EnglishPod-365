1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today we've got an elementary-level lesson for you.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's all about sending things through the mail.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So maybe gifts, maybe letters.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to the post office, so why don't we jump right into this dialogue.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's listen to it for the first time, and we'll be right back.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, so pretty simple dialogue.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We want to send a package through the mail, so why don't we take a look at some of those mail-related terms in language takeaway.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So the first item we're going to talk about in today's language takeaway is something you can send.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's called a postcard.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A postcard.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, so very popular among people who are traveling and they want to send a postcard back home.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's right.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So a postcard is something that you usually buy at a tourist destination like Walt Disney World, for example, and it has a picture on the front and some words on the back, so you can write a letter on the back of this picture.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So it's very simple.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not really a letter.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't put it in an envelope.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You just write whatever you want on the back of the postcard, but you do have to put a stamp on it in order to send it.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's right.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So stamp is our next word.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A stamp comes in different price ranges.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That means that some stamps are more expensive than other stamps.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is like money for the mail.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So you have to buy the stamps and in order to prove that you have paid for the letter that you want to send, you must place the stamps on the letter on the envelope or on the postcard, right?

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So depending on the size and weight, it costs more.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's right.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And usually you lick a stamp to place it on the card so it doesn't fall off.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
True.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You got to lick it.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
All right.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So as we talked about, a package can be a letter, a postcard, you place stamps on it and we need to weigh the package to know how much money we have to pay.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So sometimes a package is very heavy if it's filled with books, for example.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sometimes it's very light if it's filled with clothes or feathers.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And so to find out how much something weighs, we have to weigh it.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is a verb.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So this is a verb, right?

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
To weigh.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So you want to know how many kilos or how many pounds this item has.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Right.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So we could say, it weighs a lot or how much do you weigh?

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Things like this.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Very good.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Moving on, we have the different types of mailing speeds, I guess, right?

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So we saw three via priority mail, express mail or standard mail.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So let's go in parts.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go with the first one via priority mail.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Priority is fast.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It means priority is something that's important.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I have many priorities at work.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This means they're important.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Very important.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So this letter has a certain importance.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a little bit more important than, for example, the other letters.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But express is the most important, the fastest.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So something that's express is fast.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Like an expressway is the fast highway.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Express mail.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So express mail is the fastest.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And now the normal cheapest mail is standard mail.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Standard.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So the word standard usually means the average or the normal mail.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And in this case, it usually takes the longest.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So obviously standard mail is the cheapest.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Express mail is the most expensive because it's the fastest.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So we've got all of those speeds now.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's listen again to today's dialogue and try and listen for the words we just talked about.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And we'll be back in a moment to talk about some important phrases.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hi, I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Very well.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Great.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How much is this going to cost?

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, it depends.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's the difference?

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Express is the fastest, but it's also the most expensive.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, there's no rush.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Please send it via priority mail.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please be extra careful.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The contents of the package are fragile.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All right.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We're back.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
All right.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So the first phrase today is one that I like to use a lot.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We say, it's depends.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How much is this going to cost?

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, it depends.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So the phrase could be, it depends.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So it depends.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When do you usually use this?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you ask me a question, I can have one answer, but maybe there's another possible answer.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
For example, what are you going to wear tomorrow, Marco?

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It depends if it rains or not.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It depends.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If it rains, I will wear a raincoat.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If it's sunny, I will wear a normal coat.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So it depends means there is a situation or a circumstance that might change.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And if it does, my answer will change.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Right.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So it is a conditional, it depends.

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For example, I can ask you, what are you going to eat tonight?

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It depends.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If I exercise, I'm going to have a hamburger.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And if I don't exercise, I'll have a salad.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Nice.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So it depends.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now we have another phrase.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
When they were talking about how long it's going to take to mail something, he said standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So we have this little phrase there, up to.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Up to.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So up to, when you hear this, these two words together, that's an indication.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a sign that we're talking about the maximum, the most.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So tomorrow the temperature might go up to 24 degrees Celsius.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So the temperature maximum will reach 24.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It could be maybe 22, 21.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But not 25.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Not 25.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, because up to means the top.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So you're usually dealing with numbers, right?

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And for example, this coat can cost up to $150.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Wow.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So the most I will spend is $150.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So sometimes you have a number like this when we're talking about sending a package.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can send packages that weigh up to 10 kilos.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Not more than 10 kilos though.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Very good.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And now for our last phrase, to close off the dialogue, the guy said, well, you know what?

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There's no rush.

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No rush.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There's no rush.

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay.

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Well, the first word we want to look at here is the word rush.

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In this case, we're talking about sending a package and the postcard, right?

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So does this person want it to arrive fast?

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He says, no, no, there's no rush.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's send it standard.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's cheaper.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So maybe, so maybe your friend is like, come on, we're going to be late.

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're like, no, there's no rush.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's no rush.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We have one hour before the movie starts.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Calm down.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So you're not in a hurry.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No, there's no rush.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Slow down.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's okay.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is a good one to talk about with friends.

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Or if you're working on a project at work, you say, listen, there's no rush.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Take your time.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Very good.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So let's go back to our dialogue.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's listen to it for the very last time and we'll be back in a bit.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hi, I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Very well.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Great.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
How much is this going to cost?

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, it depends.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's the difference?

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Express is the fastest, but it's also the most expensive.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I see.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, there's no rush.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Please send it via priority mail.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Please be extra careful.

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The contents of the package are fragile.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
All right, we're back.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So now Catherine, do you usually send postcards when you are abroad, when you travel?

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes, I love postcards and actually I have some friends who have an amazing postcard collection.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oh, really?

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But it's not normal postcards.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They find the most ugly postcards and they buy them and they write silly notes and they send them to themselves.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh, really?

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mm-hmm.

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have the tradition of always sending my parents and my grandparents a postcard when I'm abroad.

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's so sweet.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Always.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So they have a collection of all the places you've been.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So all the time, wherever I am, the first thing that I try to do if I'm in a cool place, I send them a postcard.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And sometimes if I'm in a country in various cities and there are some nice things in, for example, two or three cities, I'll send them three postcards.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's awesome.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So do they have a book at home with all of these postcards?

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, they do.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So I just send them a little thing, how I'm doing and how great it is and wish you could be here, little notes, and then they have all the collection.

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's really cool because that way I've actually kept track a little bit of what year and what date I was in certain places.

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, wow.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well, it's also nice because postcards, you don't need to write a very long note.

220
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's no space.

221
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You just write a short note.

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You say, hi, how's the weather?

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Miss you.

224
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Wish you were here.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Right.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay, so that's all the time we have for today, but let us know if you've had any inconveniences at the post office.

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I actually had one once.

228
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I couldn't send batteries through the mail because they have acid apparently.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, yeah.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So it's very difficult to send them.

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So maybe you've had a situation like this before.

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let us know.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
EnglishPod.com.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We'll see you guys there.

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Bye, everyone.
