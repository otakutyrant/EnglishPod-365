00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:05,919
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:08,619
My name is Catherine, and welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,039
Today we've got an elementary-level lesson for you.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,939
It's all about sending things through the mail.

6
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:15,019
That's right.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,019
So maybe gifts, maybe letters.

8
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:21,760
We're going to the post office, so why don't we jump right into this dialogue.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,039
Let's listen to it for the first time, and we'll be right back.

10
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:14,939
Alright, so pretty simple dialogue.

11
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:22,859
We want to send a package through the mail, so why don't we take a look at some of those mail-related terms in language takeaway.

12
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,359
So the first item we're going to talk about in today's language takeaway is something you can send.

13
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,879
It's called a postcard.

14
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:36,239
A postcard.

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,439
Okay, so very popular among people who are traveling and they want to send a postcard back home.

16
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,219
That's right.

17
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:56,620
So a postcard is something that you usually buy at a tourist destination like Walt Disney World, for example, and it has a picture on the front and some words on the back, so you can write a letter on the back of this picture.

18
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,599
So it's very simple.

19
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,799
It's not really a letter.

20
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,140
You don't put it in an envelope.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,639
You just write whatever you want on the back of the postcard, but you do have to put a stamp on it in order to send it.

22
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,039
That's right.

23
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,479
So stamp is our next word.

24
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,759
A stamp comes in different price ranges.

25
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:19,460
That means that some stamps are more expensive than other stamps.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,620
This is like money for the mail.

27
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:34,599
So you have to buy the stamps and in order to prove that you have paid for the letter that you want to send, you must place the stamps on the letter on the envelope or on the postcard, right?

28
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,580
So depending on the size and weight, it costs more.

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,400
That's right.

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,960
And usually you lick a stamp to place it on the card so it doesn't fall off.

31
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,360
True.

32
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:44,900
That's right.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,719
You got to lick it.

34
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:46,500
All right.

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:56,840
So as we talked about, a package can be a letter, a postcard, you place stamps on it and we need to weigh the package to know how much money we have to pay.

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,659
That's right.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,780
So sometimes a package is very heavy if it's filled with books, for example.

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,219
Sometimes it's very light if it's filled with clothes or feathers.

39
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:11,139
And so to find out how much something weighs, we have to weigh it.

40
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,979
This is a verb.

41
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:12,460
Okay.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,020
So this is a verb, right?

43
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:14,719
To weigh.

44
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,819
So you want to know how many kilos or how many pounds this item has.

45
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:21,319
Right.

46
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,639
So we could say, it weighs a lot or how much do you weigh?

47
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,240
Okay.

48
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:26,860
Things like this.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,520
Very good.

50
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,479
All right.

51
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,740
Moving on, we have the different types of mailing speeds, I guess, right?

52
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,099
So we saw three via priority mail, express mail or standard mail.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,939
So let's go in parts.

54
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,360
Let's go with the first one via priority mail.

55
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,780
Priority is fast.

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,919
It means priority is something that's important.

57
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,360
So I have many priorities at work.

58
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:51,080
This means they're important.

59
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:51,759
Very important.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,379
So this letter has a certain importance.

61
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,319
It's a little bit more important than, for example, the other letters.

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,219
That's right.

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,620
But express is the most important, the fastest.

64
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,659
So something that's express is fast.

65
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,340
Like an expressway is the fast highway.

66
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,960
Express mail.

67
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:10,580
Okay.

68
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,460
So express mail is the fastest.

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,459
And now the normal cheapest mail is standard mail.

70
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:18,079
Standard.

71
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,740
So the word standard usually means the average or the normal mail.

72
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,480
And in this case, it usually takes the longest.

73
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:27,540
Okay.

74
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,139
So obviously standard mail is the cheapest.

75
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,100
Express mail is the most expensive because it's the fastest.

76
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,160
That's right.

77
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,399
So we've got all of those speeds now.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,139
Let's listen again to today's dialogue and try and listen for the words we just talked about.

79
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,660
And we'll be back in a moment to talk about some important phrases.

80
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:54,139
Hi, I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

81
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:54,939
Very well.

82
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,379
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

83
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,019
Great.

84
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,660
How much is this going to cost?

85
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,040
Well, it depends.

86
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,199
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

87
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,339
What's the difference?

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,339
Well, standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

89
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,980
Priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.

90
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,959
Express is the fastest, but it's also the most expensive.

91
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,040
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,980
I see.

93
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,300
Well, there's no rush.

94
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,360
Please send it via priority mail.

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,899
Please be extra careful.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,519
The contents of the package are fragile.

97
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:30,779
All right.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,459
We're back.

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,220
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

100
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:39,680
All right.

101
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,019
So the first phrase today is one that I like to use a lot.

102
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,620
We say, it's depends.

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,560
Okay.

104
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,000
How much is this going to cost?

105
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,459
Well, it depends.

106
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:49,980
Okay.

107
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,000
So the phrase could be, it depends.

108
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,360
So it depends.

109
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,860
When do you usually use this?

110
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,699
Okay.

111
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,839
If you ask me a question, I can have one answer, but maybe there's another possible answer.

112
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,500
For example, what are you going to wear tomorrow, Marco?

113
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,339
It depends if it rains or not.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Okay.

115
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:10,839
It depends.

116
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,839
If it rains, I will wear a raincoat.

117
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,060
If it's sunny, I will wear a normal coat.

118
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,939
So it depends means there is a situation or a circumstance that might change.

119
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,680
And if it does, my answer will change.

120
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:28,220
Right.

121
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,720
So it is a conditional, it depends.

122
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,519
For example, I can ask you, what are you going to eat tonight?

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,879
It depends.

124
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,040
If I exercise, I'm going to have a hamburger.

125
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,100
And if I don't exercise, I'll have a salad.

126
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:41,600
Nice.

127
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,180
Okay.

128
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,500
So it depends.

129
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,980
Now we have another phrase.

130
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:55,459
When they were talking about how long it's going to take to mail something, he said standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

131
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:58,000
So we have this little phrase there, up to.

132
00:06:59,019 --> 00:06:59,439
Up to.

133
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,040
So up to, when you hear this, these two words together, that's an indication.

134
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,420
It's a sign that we're talking about the maximum, the most.

135
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,360
So tomorrow the temperature might go up to 24 degrees Celsius.

136
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:14,040
Okay.

137
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,199
So the temperature maximum will reach 24.

138
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,959
It could be maybe 22, 21.

139
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,300
But not 25.

140
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:20,939
Not 25.

141
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:22,779
No, because up to means the top.

142
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,180
So you're usually dealing with numbers, right?

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,160
And for example, this coat can cost up to $150.

144
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,019
Wow.

145
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,300
So the most I will spend is $150.

146
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,100
So sometimes you have a number like this when we're talking about sending a package.

147
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,600
We can send packages that weigh up to 10 kilos.

148
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,779
Not more than 10 kilos though.

149
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,399
Okay.

150
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,220
Very good.

151
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,540
And now for our last phrase, to close off the dialogue, the guy said, well, you know what?

152
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:52,819
There's no rush.

153
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,040
No rush.

154
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,759
There's no rush.

155
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,040
Okay.

156
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,360
Well, the first word we want to look at here is the word rush.

157
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,600
In this case, we're talking about sending a package and the postcard, right?

158
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,699
So does this person want it to arrive fast?

159
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,079
He says, no, no, there's no rush.

160
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,319
Let's send it standard.

161
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:09,980
It's cheaper.

162
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:10,740
Okay.

163
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,139
So maybe, so maybe your friend is like, come on, we're going to be late.

164
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,519
You're like, no, there's no rush.

165
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,300
There's no rush.

166
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,899
We have one hour before the movie starts.

167
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:20,759
Calm down.

168
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,259
Okay.

169
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,720
So you're not in a hurry.

170
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,959
No, there's no rush.

171
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:24,939
Slow down.

172
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:25,560
It's okay.

173
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,759
This is a good one to talk about with friends.

174
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,820
Or if you're working on a project at work, you say, listen, there's no rush.

175
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,039
Take your time.

176
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:34,519
Okay.

177
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,360
Very good.

178
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,240
So let's go back to our dialogue.

179
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's listen to it for the very last time and we'll be back in a bit.

180
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,019
Hi, I would like to send this package to China and these postcards as well.

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,759
Very well.

182
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,259
You will need some stamps for the postcards and I need to weigh that package too.

183
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:58,860
Great.

184
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,460
How much is this going to cost?

185
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,860
Well, it depends.

186
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:05,019
Do you want to send it via priority, express or standard mail?

187
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,159
What's the difference?

188
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,159
Well, standard mail can take up to 15 working days.

189
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,820
Yes, priority is a bit faster and will arrive in about five to eight working days.

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,759
Express is the fastest, but it's also the most expensive.

191
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,879
It only takes three days and you can track your package online.

192
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:19,799
I see.

193
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Well, there's no rush.

194
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,159
Please send it via priority mail.

195
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,740
Please be extra careful.

196
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,419
The contents of the package are fragile.

197
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,519
All right, we're back.

198
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,200
So now Catherine, do you usually send postcards when you are abroad, when you travel?

199
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:45,100
Yes, I love postcards and actually I have some friends who have an amazing postcard collection.

200
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:45,679
Oh, really?

201
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,679
But it's not normal postcards.

202
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:55,100
They find the most ugly postcards and they buy them and they write silly notes and they send them to themselves.

203
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:55,860
Oh, really?

204
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:56,440
Mm-hmm.

205
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,539
I have the tradition of always sending my parents and my grandparents a postcard when I'm abroad.

206
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:02,259
That's so sweet.

207
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:02,679
Yeah.

208
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,019
Always.

209
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,120
So they have a collection of all the places you've been.

210
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,639
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:12,039
So all the time, wherever I am, the first thing that I try to do if I'm in a cool place, I send them a postcard.

212
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:19,539
And sometimes if I'm in a country in various cities and there are some nice things in, for example, two or three cities, I'll send them three postcards.

213
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,399
That's awesome.

214
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,000
So do they have a book at home with all of these postcards?

215
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,840
Yeah, they do.

216
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:32,519
So I just send them a little thing, how I'm doing and how great it is and wish you could be here, little notes, and then they have all the collection.

217
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,240
It's really cool because that way I've actually kept track a little bit of what year and what date I was in certain places.

218
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:38,679
Oh, wow.

219
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,519
Well, it's also nice because postcards, you don't need to write a very long note.

220
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,440
There's no space.

221
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,679
You just write a short note.

222
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,159
You say, hi, how's the weather?

223
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:46,879
Miss you.

224
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,720
Wish you were here.

225
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:48,559
Right.

226
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:55,320
Okay, so that's all the time we have for today, but let us know if you've had any inconveniences at the post office.

227
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,980
I actually had one once.

228
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,480
I couldn't send batteries through the mail because they have acid apparently.

229
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:01,259
Oh, yeah.

230
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,980
So it's very difficult to send them.

231
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,360
So maybe you've had a situation like this before.

232
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,139
Let us know.

233
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,500
EnglishPod.com.

234
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,279
We'll see you guys there.

235
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,879
Bye, everyone.
