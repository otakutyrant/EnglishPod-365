00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Katherine and today we have an elementary level lesson for you all about computers.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we are going to take a look at some of the basic parts of a computer and also about bad programs that could affect your computer and make it not work.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So before we get going, we have a verb for you that we're going to look at in Vocabulary Preview.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alright, so today on Vocabulary Preview, we have a verb, as you said, and it's to crash.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
To crash.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, this has a couple of different meanings, but in today's dialogue, this means for your computer to shut down or to freeze or to stop working.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Right, because maybe you heard of a car crash, right, when two cars bam hit each other.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this case, your computer is just not working anymore.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It stopped working.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It freezes.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's right, so you can't use it.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So my computer crashed is a way to say my computer stopped working.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, so that's a word that we're going to listen in our dialogue today.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why don't we jump right into it and we'll be back shortly.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello, thanks for calling 123 Tech Help.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm Todd.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How can I help you?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can you help me?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
My computer.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, man.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's okay, sir.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Calm down.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What happened?

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I mean, the monitor went black.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay, sir.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It sounds like you might have a virus.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't feel sick.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let me check.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Nope, no fever.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm fine.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, your computer might have a virus.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe that's why it crashed.

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Phew.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Crash?

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Spyware?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Trojans?

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Where?

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
When?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All right, so lots of great technology words today.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's take a look at a few of them in Language Takeaway.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Language Takeaway.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All right, so let's start off with our first word.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You've probably heard it before, but let's go over it just in case.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A laptop.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Laptop.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A laptop is a kind of computer.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We have desktop, laptop.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So your lap is the top part of your legs.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So a laptop computer is a small portable computer that you can take with you anywhere.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's right.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A lot of students have laptops and businessmen as well.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So you mentioned the opposite would be a desktop.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Right, so it sits on top of a desk.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, so both a desktop and a laptop have monitors, a computer monitor.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So a monitor is like a TV for your computer.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's where you can see what you're doing.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, so it's called a monitor, or a screen maybe.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can also use the word screen, but monitor is the technical word for usually a box, like a TV that goes with the desktop computer.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, very good.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So Todd, the computer guy, said, hey, I think your computer might have a virus.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Ooh, that doesn't sound good.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, a virus.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I guess you know what a virus is when you get sick, right?

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You get the flu or the cold.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's right, you can say, I have a virus.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But how can a computer have a virus?

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This means?

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a program that is designed to hurt your computer.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right, so it's like your computer is sick and it doesn't work.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So a virus might make your computer crash.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So in order to avoid this, what we need is an antivirus program.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, so virus is a bad thing.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Antivirus is a good thing.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
An antivirus program is a program that protects your computer from viruses.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So you would say antivirus.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You might have heard of a very famous program called Norton Antivirus, or McAfee Antivirus.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
These are brands.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, very good.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So those are some of the main technical terms that we have on language takeaway.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue quickly once again?

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue quickly again?

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hello, thanks for calling 123 Tech Help.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm Todd.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How can I help you?

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Well, hello?

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Can you help me?

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My computer.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, man.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's okay, sir.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Calm down.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What happened?

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I mean, the monitor went black.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay, sir.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It sounds like you might have a virus.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't feel sick.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let me check.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Nope, no fever.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm fine.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, your computer might have a virus.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Maybe that's why it crashed.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Phew.

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Crash?

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Spyware?

122
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Trojans?

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where?

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When?

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right, we're back.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So now let's start off with three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This first phrase is one that I know you use a lot.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I use it too.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We say, oh, man.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, man.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So now, depending on the tone, it can mean different things, right?

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So in this case, what does it mean?

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So the man who's having problems with his computer says, my computer.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, man.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He seems a little bit anguished.

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Disappointed.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, man.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it's an interjection.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So you can say, oh, man, my computer crashed.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, man, you're always late.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now you can also say it for maybe surprise, like, oh, man.

147
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So when you're excited about something, oh, man, this computer game is awesome.

148
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
OK.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So it's just a way of expressing maybe disappointment or, in some cases, excitement.

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's right.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So think about the way that you say it.

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, man.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, man.

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
OK.

155
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So now the guy, Todd, he tells him, hey, sir, it's OK.

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Calm down.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
OK.

159
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So this might be funny sounding because we say calm, so be calm.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Calm down.

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is a phrase.

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's almost like you're so upset and you're standing up.

163
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Calm down.

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Calm down.

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Cool it.

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So you tell someone to calm down.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So you might hear a parent say about their child, the child won't calm down.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What do I do?

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
OK.

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So it's a phrase.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's use it together.

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Calm down.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Calm down.

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To calm down.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
All right.

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And now for our third phrase.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean.

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
OK, so this is also an interjection and it's very, very, very common, OK?

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So you'll probably hear people when they're talking, they're like, oh, I went over there.

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I mean, we went to this place.

183
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's an interjection.

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's right.

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And usually we say this when we want to correct what we just said.

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
For example, your computer might have a virus.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

188
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OK.

189
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So the computer support man, Todd, he understands maybe this person doesn't know what a virus is.

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So, I mean, he's he's changing what he just said.

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We could say, oh, Saturday, I'm going to the movies.

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I mean, Sunday, I'm going to the movies.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OK.

194
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What are you doing on Sunday?

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All right.

196
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So you use it to correct yourself or maybe further explain something, because maybe you are talking about a topic and maybe the person is not understanding you.

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So you want to make it more clear.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I mean, right.

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She was very angry at me.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I mean, of course she was because I did something wrong.

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So it's a way to offer an explanation.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
All right.

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So try and use that one in your speech this week.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's really, really great common English phrase.

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
All right.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hello, thanks for calling one, two, three tech help.

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm Todd.

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How can I help you?

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, hello.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Can you help me on my computer?

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, man.

215
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's OK, sir.

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Calm down.

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What happened?

218
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I mean, the monitor went black.

220
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
OK, sir.

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It sounds like you might have a virus.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't feel sick.

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let me check.

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Nope.

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No fever.

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm fine.

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No, your computer might have a virus.

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Maybe that's why it crashed.

230
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Phew.

232
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wait a minute.

233
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Crash.

234
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Spyware.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Trojans.

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What?

237
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where?

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
When?

239
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All right.

240
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, Marco, in today's dialogue, we heard a couple of strange words about computer viruses.

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
One of them you might be familiar with from Greek stories and fables.

242
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
A Trojan.

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
All right.

244
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
A Trojan.

245
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So it's a kind of bad software that will hurt your computer.

246
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a type of virus that comes in and it's supposed to be a good program or not harm your computer, but it's really just a lie.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's disguised as something else and then it starts to really ruin your computer.

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They're very, very dangerous.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So why do you think it's called a Trojan?

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't know.

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Probably because of Troy something because it's very difficult like a Trojan.

253
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, think about the story of the Trojan horse, right?

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You know that story.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, so back in ancient Greece, there was a war happening and Troy wanted to defeat its enemy and they didn't know how to do it.

256
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So they thought and thought and thought and they came up with an idea.

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They would build a horse and they would give it as a gift, but inside the horse would be warriors, fighters.

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So when the city opened its doors to this wonderful gift, they would receive a horrible gift and attack.

259
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And so Trojan is like that.

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's like software that you think is safe, but then it attacks your computer by surprise.

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They're very dangerous.

262
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And now things have come up like Trojans and worms and a lot of different names for them, but it's crazy now, although I hear Mac users don't have these problems.

263
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We do not.

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you use a Macintosh computer, you probably have very few problems with viruses and things like that.

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's one point in favor for Mac users.

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So let us know, have you had problems with a virus on your computer?

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Have you ever called tech support?

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

269
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We hope to see you there.

270
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
All right.

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Bye everyone.

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Bye.
