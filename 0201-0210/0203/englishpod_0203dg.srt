Hello, thanks for calling 123 Tech Help.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,560
I'm Todd.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,500
How can I help you?

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:10,460
Hello?

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,900
Can you help me on my computer?

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,119
Oh, man.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,140
It's okay, sir.

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,059
Calm down.

9
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:16,760
What happened?

10
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,920
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

11
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:21,140
I mean, the monitor went black.

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,300
Okay, sir.

13
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,199
It sounds like you might have a virus.

14
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,379
I don't feel sick.

15
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,559
Let me check.

16
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:28,699
Nope.

17
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:29,440
No fever.

18
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm fine.

19
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,039
No, your computer might have a virus.

20
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,179
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

21
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,780
Maybe that's why it crashed.

22
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:44,439
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans.

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,420
Phew.

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,100
Wait a minute.

25
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:48,200
Crash.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,600
Spyware.

27
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:50,759
Trojans.

28
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:51,539
What?

29
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:52,399
Where?

30
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,340
When?
