Hello, thanks for calling 123 Tech Help.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm Todd.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
How can I help you?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Can you help me on my computer?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, man.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's okay, sir.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Calm down.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What happened?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I turned on my laptop and it broke.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I mean, the monitor went black.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, sir.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It sounds like you might have a virus.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't feel sick.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me check.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Nope.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No fever.

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm fine.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, your computer might have a virus.

20
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I mean, it has a bad program on it.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Maybe that's why it crashed.

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I recommend that you run an antivirus program in order to safely remove any unwanted spyware or Trojans.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Phew.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait a minute.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Crash.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Spyware.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Trojans.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What?

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Where?

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When?
