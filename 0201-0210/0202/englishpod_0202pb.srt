00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And my name is Katherine, and today we've got a great lesson for you about traveling and getting directions.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So sometimes we are looking for an address, we are looking for our friend's house, and we can't find it.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So what do you have to do?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You have to stop and ask someone for directions.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's actually a joke in many countries that men hate to ask for directions, and so this is the women's approach, asking and getting directions and finally finding your way.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So it's a good thing.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's a very good thing.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So we're going to jump right into the dialogue.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's see what happens here and if they can find the place they're looking for.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We are not lost.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm just taking the scenic route.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, whatever.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale, but would you listen to me?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, this is so typical.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Fine, I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Excuse me, sir.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Can you tell me how to get to St.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Mary's Church?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sure.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thanks.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
See, was that hard?

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So, well, the woman was obviously a little bit angry that the guy refused to admit that he was lost.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
She's very frustrated.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And this has been in movies and in books and all sorts of things.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This kind of story of the man not wanting to ask for directions.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And so he keeps saying, listen, I've got these excuses.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm taking the scenic route, for example.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's right.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And that's our first word for today on language takeaway.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So, as you say, the scenic route, what does he mean by that?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
OK, route is like a path or a trail or kind of like the way that you go somewhere.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So the routes to my house.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But in this case, the scenic route or the scenic route, you can say in both ways, is the most beautiful way to go.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's a little bit longer.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The longer one.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So you can say, oh, it's just the scenic route.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not really true.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's just the longer route.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Exactly.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that's the excuse that he's giving her.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He's like, no, I'm not lost.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We're taking longer because, well, we're taking the beautiful route.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
With all the trees and the animals and the lakes.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, I don't.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't buy it.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't believe this.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And she said, yeah, whatever.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You know what?

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We need a GPS.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
OK, GPS, Global Positioning System.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So many people have these in their cars these days.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is like an electronic map that will use your location to show you where to go.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's very useful, and especially in places like the United States that have streets that are clearly marked and it's just a little bit easier to get around.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know, you can just get in your car, type in the address you want to go to, and the thing talks to you.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It says, turn left.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Go straight.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Turn right.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Creepy.

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So this is a very useful device.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's like a computer that you use in your computer, a GPS.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
All right.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So she's talking about the GPS.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then at the end of that line, she says, this is so typical.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So what?

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Getting lost.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
All right.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Getting lost is so typical.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So something that is typical is common.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is so normal.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is so typical.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is so something you normally do.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So what other examples could we give with the word typical?

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Something that is typical.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
OK, well, you can have a behavior like this.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What he did was typical.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We can also say, in my typical Saturday, I wake up late and drink a coffee and take a nap.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
OK, cool.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So it's common.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's regular.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's frequent, maybe.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Or, you know, you go out to dinner and your friend is late, you say, oh, this is so typical of him.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Right.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He's always late.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
OK, very good.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And we have one last set of words here.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And when the guy was giving him instructions, he said, you know what?

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Go left, go right, whatever.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And then he said, until you reach the set of traffic lights.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So what is a traffic light?

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Well, you know what a light is.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You know what traffic is.

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Traffic is cars driving on the road, trucks, things like that.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So traffic light is a special light with three colors, red, yellow and green.

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And it tells you if you can stop or go.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So they're also called stop lights.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
OK.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So stop lights and traffic lights is the same thing.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Usually they hang from above the street.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
OK, very good.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Words and phrases there.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And we'll be back in just a little bit.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We are not lost.

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm just taking the scenic route.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah, whatever.

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But would you listen to me?

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, this is so typical.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Fine.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Excuse me, sir.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can you tell me how to get to St.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Mary's Church?

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sure.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights, and turn left.

134
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thanks.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
See?

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Was that hard?

138
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If you would only listen to me more often, you'd be better off.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
All right, so we've got some great phrases coming up in Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is what the wife said at the very beginning.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She said, we have been going around in circles for the past hour.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Going around in circles.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So we could say we've been driving in circles.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In circles means you've been making the same route over and over and over again.

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You keep seeing the same house, the same tree, the same house, the same tree.

147
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So this means we're not going anywhere.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You could also say, Marco, I wish you had brought the map.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We've been walking in circles for two hours.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, cool.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So you can use it if you're driving or if you're walking in any situation like that.

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, good.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right, so going around in circles.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, moving on, the guy was a little bit irritated with her, and he said something that's a little bit impolite.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He said, you know what?

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to ask for directions if it will shut your trap.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Impolite?

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, this is rude.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is rude.

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, this is very rude.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So be careful when you use this.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You can say, hey, shut your trap.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Okay, so shut means to close.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But trap, this is your mouth.

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Your mouth is a trap.

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's kind of like a trap.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In this case, shut your trap is a set phrase, and it means shut up, be quiet, stop talking.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So how can we say this in a nicer way?

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
For example, I've heard people say your yap.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Shut your yap.

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, shut your yapper.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I would say, can you please stop talking, or can we have some quiet time now?

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Can we have some quiet time?

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yeah, that's a polite way.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The rude way is shut up.

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shut up, yeah.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Shut your mouth.

179
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's very direct, though, right?

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Very rude.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah, that's right.

182
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, so shut your trap.

183
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Shut your trap.

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And then the wife said, well, see, there you go.

185
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We got directions.

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We're going to get there now.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And was that hard?

188
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So the guy would be better off.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That doesn't really make much sense.

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
To be better off.

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, so you have to think of this as a phrase, not about the individual words.

193
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
To be better off means to be happier, or in some way better.

194
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So for example, if I earned more money, I think I'd be better off.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay, I have a nicer life.

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
To be happier, maybe more successful.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right.

199
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Or if you only listened to me, you would be better off means you would make better decisions.

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You would have a better situation.

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So I could say, if she got a divorce, she would be better off.

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's right.

203
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Her life would improve.

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Her life would improve.

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
To be better off.

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
This is a great, great, very useful phrase.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Very useful.

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All right, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more with you.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We are not lost.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm just taking the scenic route.

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, whatever.

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But would you listen to me?

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No, this is so typical.

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Fine.

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

219
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Excuse me, sir.

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Can you tell me how to get to St.

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Mary's Church?

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Sure.

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights, and turn left.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

225
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Thanks.

226
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
See?

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Was that hard?

228
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
All right, so the whole thing about men asking for directions.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why do you think men don't like to ask for directions?

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, it depends on the person, but I think a lot of people don't like to admit that they don't know.

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Because if you ask for directions, it means, I don't know where I'm going, I need help.

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So this is one problem.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The other problem is sometimes directions are bad.

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think so too.

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sometimes when you receive an invitation or instructions on how to get to someone's house, they're very ambiguous.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They're like, you know, you pass the dog that's sitting at the corner and you're like, there's no dog.

238
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
How?

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, I know.

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I know someone who lives in Costa Rica, and her address is, go down the main street, take the second left after the post office, and after that, take the right after the general store, and 400 paces is the house.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So there's no address.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's no address.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, it happens.

245
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So these instructions can be very confusing, very vague, like you said.

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I think there's a couple different problems potentially.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I also heard a joke the other day about a kid asked his mom, he said, hey, why was Moses leading everyone through the desert for 40 years?

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And she's like, because he refused to ask for directions.

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Funny.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I like that.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was gonna say why, because he's going in circles.

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
All right, so if you have any questions about today's lessons or comments, maybe you can tell us, do you like to ask for directions or do you like to figure things out alone?

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

255
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Bye.
