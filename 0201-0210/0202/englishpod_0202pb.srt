00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,599
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,540
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,400
And my name is Katherine, and today we've got a great lesson for you about traveling and getting directions.

4
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,359
That's right.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,800
So sometimes we are looking for an address, we are looking for our friend's house, and we can't find it.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,679
So what do you have to do?

7
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:23,760
You have to stop and ask someone for directions.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:34,799
It's actually a joke in many countries that men hate to ask for directions, and so this is the women's approach, asking and getting directions and finally finding your way.

9
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,240
So it's a good thing.

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,460
That's a very good thing.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,960
So we're going to jump right into the dialogue.

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,780
Let's see what happens here and if they can find the place they're looking for.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,159
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,659
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,420
We are not lost.

16
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm just taking the scenic route.

17
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,179
Yeah, whatever.

18
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:03,200
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale, but would you listen to me?

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,159
No, this is so typical.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,560
Fine, I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

21
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,140
Excuse me, sir.

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,159
Can you tell me how to get to St.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,879
Mary's Church?

24
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,260
Sure.

25
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:23,219
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

26
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,840
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

27
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,980
Thanks.

28
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:30,239
See, was that hard?

29
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:33,480
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,439
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,299
So, well, the woman was obviously a little bit angry that the guy refused to admit that he was lost.

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,280
That's right.

33
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,280
She's very frustrated.

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,299
And this has been in movies and in books and all sorts of things.

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,659
This kind of story of the man not wanting to ask for directions.

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,180
And so he keeps saying, listen, I've got these excuses.

37
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,540
I'm taking the scenic route, for example.

38
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,359
That's right.

39
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,040
And that's our first word for today on language takeaway.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,980
Language takeaway.

41
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,719
So, as you say, the scenic route, what does he mean by that?

42
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,919
OK, route is like a path or a trail or kind of like the way that you go somewhere.

43
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,539
So the routes to my house.

44
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:25,740
But in this case, the scenic route or the scenic route, you can say in both ways, is the most beautiful way to go.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,020
It's a little bit longer.

46
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:27,979
The longer one.

47
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,840
So you can say, oh, it's just the scenic route.

48
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:32,020
It's not really true.

49
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,479
It's just the longer route.

50
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,479
Exactly.

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,680
So that's the excuse that he's giving her.

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,840
He's like, no, I'm not lost.

53
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,360
We're taking longer because, well, we're taking the beautiful route.

54
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:41,900
All right.

55
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,860
With all the trees and the animals and the lakes.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,539
No, I don't.

57
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,300
I don't buy it.

58
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,120
I don't believe this.

59
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:46,780
That's right.

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,340
And she said, yeah, whatever.

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,939
You know what?

62
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,280
We need a GPS.

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,860
OK, GPS, Global Positioning System.

64
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,800
So many people have these in their cars these days.

65
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,680
This is like an electronic map that will use your location to show you where to go.

66
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:15,319
It's very useful, and especially in places like the United States that have streets that are clearly marked and it's just a little bit easier to get around.

67
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:20,219
You know, you can just get in your car, type in the address you want to go to, and the thing talks to you.

68
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,120
It says, turn left.

69
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,840
Go straight.

70
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,539
Turn right.

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,560
Creepy.

72
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,319
So this is a very useful device.

73
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,400
It's like a computer that you use in your computer, a GPS.

74
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:31,099
All right.

75
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,139
So she's talking about the GPS.

76
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,639
And then at the end of that line, she says, this is so typical.

77
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:39,759
So what?

78
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,460
Getting lost.

79
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,020
All right.

80
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,439
Getting lost is so typical.

81
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,680
So something that is typical is common.

82
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,680
This is so normal.

83
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,919
This is so typical.

84
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,740
This is so something you normally do.

85
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,379
So what other examples could we give with the word typical?

86
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,560
Something that is typical.

87
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,139
OK, well, you can have a behavior like this.

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,520
What he did was typical.

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:08,159
We can also say, in my typical Saturday, I wake up late and drink a coffee and take a nap.

90
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,319
OK, cool.

91
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,439
So it's common.

92
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,580
It's regular.

93
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,879
It's frequent, maybe.

94
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:13,439
That's right.

95
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,620
Or, you know, you go out to dinner and your friend is late, you say, oh, this is so typical of him.

96
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:18,939
Right.

97
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,819
He's always late.

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,019
OK, very good.

99
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,279
All right.

100
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,579
And we have one last set of words here.

101
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:29,100
And when the guy was giving him instructions, he said, you know what?

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,100
Go left, go right, whatever.

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,040
And then he said, until you reach the set of traffic lights.

104
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,620
So what is a traffic light?

105
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:37,860
Well, you know what a light is.

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,120
You know what traffic is.

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,579
Traffic is cars driving on the road, trucks, things like that.

108
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,319
So traffic light is a special light with three colors, red, yellow and green.

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,480
And it tells you if you can stop or go.

110
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,079
So they're also called stop lights.

111
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:52,720
That's right.

112
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:53,500
OK.

113
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,459
So stop lights and traffic lights is the same thing.

114
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,980
Usually they hang from above the street.

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,740
OK, very good.

116
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:03,439
Words and phrases there.

117
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,439
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

118
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,459
And we'll be back in just a little bit.

119
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,959
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

120
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,480
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

121
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,240
We are not lost.

122
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,879
I'm just taking the scenic route.

123
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:20,959
Yeah, whatever.

124
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,740
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

125
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But would you listen to me?

126
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,959
No, this is so typical.

127
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,079
Fine.

128
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,399
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

129
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,959
Excuse me, sir.

130
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,980
Can you tell me how to get to St.

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,720
Mary's Church?

132
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,019
Sure.

133
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:45,060
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights, and turn left.

134
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:48,699
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

135
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:49,800
Thanks.

136
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:51,180
See?

137
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:52,079
Was that hard?

138
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,139
If you would only listen to me more often, you'd be better off.

139
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,420
All right, so we've got some great phrases coming up in Fluency Builder.

140
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:04,660
Fluency Builder.

141
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,759
So the first phrase that we're going to look at is what the wife said at the very beginning.

142
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,680
She said, we have been going around in circles for the past hour.

143
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,660
Going around in circles.

144
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,339
So we could say we've been driving in circles.

145
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,500
In circles means you've been making the same route over and over and over again.

146
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:28,060
You keep seeing the same house, the same tree, the same house, the same tree.

147
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,399
So this means we're not going anywhere.

148
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:35,019
You could also say, Marco, I wish you had brought the map.

149
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:38,000
We've been walking in circles for two hours.

150
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,180
Okay, cool.

151
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,480
So you can use it if you're driving or if you're walking in any situation like that.

152
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:44,860
Okay, good.

153
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
All right, so going around in circles.

154
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:54,019
Now, moving on, the guy was a little bit irritated with her, and he said something that's a little bit impolite.

155
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,160
He said, you know what?

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm going to ask for directions if it will shut your trap.

157
00:06:58,879 --> 00:06:59,240
Impolite?

158
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, this is rude.

159
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:00,939
This is rude.

160
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,139
Yeah, this is very rude.

161
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,220
So be careful when you use this.

162
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:06,579
You can say, hey, shut your trap.

163
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:09,019
Okay, so shut means to close.

164
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,319
But trap, this is your mouth.

165
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,139
Okay.

166
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,160
Your mouth is a trap.

167
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:15,100
It's kind of like a trap.

168
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:22,060
In this case, shut your trap is a set phrase, and it means shut up, be quiet, stop talking.

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,160
So how can we say this in a nicer way?

170
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,480
For example, I've heard people say your yap.

171
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:29,360
Shut your yap.

172
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,800
Yeah, shut your yapper.

173
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,759
I would say, can you please stop talking, or can we have some quiet time now?

174
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:37,939
Can we have some quiet time?

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
Yeah, that's a polite way.

176
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,259
The rude way is shut up.

177
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,040
Shut up, yeah.

178
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:42,920
Shut your mouth.

179
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,860
That's very direct, though, right?

180
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:45,339
Very rude.

181
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,180
Yeah, that's right.

182
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,480
Okay, so shut your trap.

183
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:48,300
Shut your trap.

184
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,259
And then the wife said, well, see, there you go.

185
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,120
We got directions.

186
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,279
We're going to get there now.

187
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,279
And was that hard?

188
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,139
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

189
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,579
So the guy would be better off.

190
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,139
That doesn't really make much sense.

191
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:03,899
To be better off.

192
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:08,560
Okay, so you have to think of this as a phrase, not about the individual words.

193
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,500
To be better off means to be happier, or in some way better.

194
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,160
So for example, if I earned more money, I think I'd be better off.

195
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:18,779
Okay.

196
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:20,279
Okay, I have a nicer life.

197
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,319
To be happier, maybe more successful.

198
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,259
Right.

199
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:29,519
Or if you only listened to me, you would be better off means you would make better decisions.

200
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,980
You would have a better situation.

201
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,940
So I could say, if she got a divorce, she would be better off.

202
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:37,340
That's right.

203
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,940
Her life would improve.

204
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,940
Her life would improve.

205
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,080
To be better off.

206
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,179
This is a great, great, very useful phrase.

207
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,840
Very useful.

208
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,019
All right, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more with you.

209
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:59,139
We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

210
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,639
Will you just please stop and ask for directions?

211
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,399
We are not lost.

212
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,039
I'm just taking the scenic route.

213
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,159
Yeah, whatever.

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,899
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale.

215
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,159
But would you listen to me?

216
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:12,139
No, this is so typical.

217
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,259
Fine.

218
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,559
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

219
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:18,120
Excuse me, sir.

220
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,139
Can you tell me how to get to St.

221
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,879
Mary's Church?

222
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:22,179
Sure.

223
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:30,200
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights, and turn left.

224
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,840
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

225
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:34,960
Thanks.

226
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,360
See?

227
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,240
Was that hard?

228
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,500
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.

229
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,419
All right, so the whole thing about men asking for directions.

230
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:52,120
Why do you think men don't like to ask for directions?

231
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:59,419
Well, it depends on the person, but I think a lot of people don't like to admit that they don't know.

232
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Because if you ask for directions, it means, I don't know where I'm going, I need help.

233
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,019
So this is one problem.

234
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,639
The other problem is sometimes directions are bad.

235
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,240
I think so too.

236
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,919
Sometimes when you receive an invitation or instructions on how to get to someone's house, they're very ambiguous.

237
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:23,059
They're like, you know, you pass the dog that's sitting at the corner and you're like, there's no dog.

238
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,240
What?

239
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:23,659
How?

240
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,580
Yeah, I know.

241
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:36,659
I know someone who lives in Costa Rica, and her address is, go down the main street, take the second left after the post office, and after that, take the right after the general store, and 400 paces is the house.

242
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,720
So there's no address.

243
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,620
There's no address.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,960
Yeah, it happens.

245
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,419
So these instructions can be very confusing, very vague, like you said.

246
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:46,639
So I think there's a couple different problems potentially.

247
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:55,840
I also heard a joke the other day about a kid asked his mom, he said, hey, why was Moses leading everyone through the desert for 40 years?

248
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,299
And she's like, because he refused to ask for directions.

249
00:10:59,700 --> 00:10:59,799
Funny.

250
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,600
I like that.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,720
I was gonna say why, because he's going in circles.

252
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:13,200
All right, so if you have any questions about today's lessons or comments, maybe you can tell us, do you like to ask for directions or do you like to figure things out alone?

253
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,340
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

254
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,340
All right, we'll see you guys there.

255
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,639
Bye.
