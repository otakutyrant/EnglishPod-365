EnglishPod.com We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

00:00:08,619 --> 00:00:10,380
Will you just please stop- Honey crowd.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,480
Yeah, whatever.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,539
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale, but would you listen to me?

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,539
No, this is so typical.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,620
Fine.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,940
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,500
Excuse me, sir.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,539
Can you tell me how to get to St.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,280
Mary's Church?

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:27,539
Sure.

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:35,600
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,240
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,340
Thanks.

15
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,640
See, was that hard?

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,640
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.
