EnglishPod.com We've been going around in circles for the past hour.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Will you just please stop- Honey crowd.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, whatever.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I told you we should buy that GPS that was on sale, but would you listen to me?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, this is so typical.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Fine.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll ask this guy for directions if it will shut your trap.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Excuse me, sir.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Can you tell me how to get to St.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Mary's Church?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sure.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Go down Park Road, turn left, go up as far as the set of traffic lights and turn left.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The place you're looking for is the second building on the right.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thanks.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
See, was that hard?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you would only listen to me more often, you would be better off.
