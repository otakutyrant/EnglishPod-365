00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:11,519
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very dramatic intermediate level lesson for you.

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,240
That's right.

5
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:17,699
Today we're going to take a look at how a court works, for example, in the United States.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,859
So you see that in movies and TV shows a lot, you know, The Judge and all that.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,559
That's right.

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,879
Many of you have seen the movie The Firm or 12 Angry Men.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:31,059
And these are classics in, you know, courtroom drama, as we say.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,899
So today we're in a courtroom and there are many characters who are trying to determine if this person is innocent or guilty.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,420
So let's take a listen and find out what's going on.

12
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:54,520
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Robert Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit.

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,079
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,200
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,959
People who claimed the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

16
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:08,439
I feel sorry for these victims.

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,659
I really do.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,180
But my client is innocent.

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,719
Let's look at the facts.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,959
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

21
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:29,359
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,840
There is no evidence.

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,920
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving your verdict.

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,459
Look at the facts.

25
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,219
Look at the evidence.

26
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,459
My client is innocent.

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,579
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,159
Yes, Your Honor.

29
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,579
Our verdict is not guilty.

30
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,359
Thank you so much.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,260
You were great.

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,319
Thank you for all your hard work.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,060
You're welcome, Robert.

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,540
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,959
Take care of yourself, okay?

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,840
Thanks once again.

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,120
Hey, where's my wallet?

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:28,560
All right, we're back, so you've probably heard a lot of technical words that are specifically related to the courtroom, to lawyers, and the laws, so why don't we take a look at some of those now in Language Takeaway.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Language Takeaway.

40
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,939
The first language takeaway we're looking at today is all about people, so people you will find in a courtroom.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,180
Who is the first person on our list, Marco?

42
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,460
So the top person would be the judge.

43
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:44,520
The judge.

44
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:48,479
Now, you didn't really see this word, judge, in the dialogue, right?

45
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,360
You did hear, though, the phrase, Your Honor.

46
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,180
Your Honor.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,759
So Your Honor.

48
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,939
So that's how you talk to a judge.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,500
You always add Your Honor before it, or something like that?

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,840
That's right.

51
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,180
So, you know, we say Mr.

52
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:11,479
President when we're talking to Barack Obama, but if we're talking to a judge, he's a special person in American society, so we call him, or her, Your Honor.

53
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,159
Your Honor.

54
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:12,740
Okay.

55
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,180
All right, Your Honor, the judge.

56
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,120
That's our first person.

57
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:15,539
Okay.

58
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:16,319
Who else do we have?

59
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:24,800
So we have the judge, and now we have a group of 12 people who will ultimately decide if the person is guilty or not.

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,560
That's right.

61
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,740
So these people are normal.

62
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:32,840
They come from all different parts of society, and they will decide what to do with this person.

63
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,919
Is he guilty, or is she innocent?

64
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,099
This group is called the jury.

65
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:37,680
Okay.

66
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:49,039
So the jury is a group of normal citizens who will listen to both sides of the story, and will then decide if the person committed the crime or didn't commit the crime.

67
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:50,080
That's right, a jury.

68
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,379
And the big question is, who's fighting?

69
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,620
We have two sides, someone who's upset, and someone who is defending themselves.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,360
The person who is upset, this is the prosecution.

71
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,039
Okay.

72
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,280
So the prosecution has a group of lawyers that are called the prosecutors, right?

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,800
That's right.

74
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,919
And they're trying to prove that that person committed the crime.

75
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:15,479
For example, I say that Marco burned down my house.

76
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,199
I go to court, I say, I am the prosecution.

77
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,100
I want him to pay me for my house, so I'm the prosecution.

78
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,620
Okay.

79
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,639
So you're trying to not only prove that I committed the crime, but also trying to get me to pay for the damage that I caused.

80
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:31,339
Exactly.

81
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:36,819
So in this case, the prosecution says, this man stole my wallet, he's a pickpocket.

82
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,600
And who is the pickpocket?

83
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,839
Or maybe the pickpocket.

84
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,199
Who's the other side of this?

85
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,060
The defendant.

86
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,800
Defend defendant.

87
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,220
Think about the word here.

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,639
To defend is to stand up for yourself, to protect yourself.

89
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,019
So the defendant says, listen, no, that's not true.

90
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
I am not a pickpocket.

91
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,620
I didn't do that.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,620
So we have the prosecution and the defense, okay?

93
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,740
And the person who might be guilty, the person who did the thing or didn't do the thing, is called the defendant.

94
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,500
Okay.

95
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:15,899
So in your example, again, about the crime that maybe I burnt your house down or I didn't, I would be the defendant and my lawyers would constitute my defense.

96
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah, they are your defense.

97
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,139
Okay.

98
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:18,500
Okay.

99
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,000
So very technical words, but the important thing to remember here is defendant.

100
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,920
All right, good.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,319
So now we have one key element that is also a person.

102
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,379
We have the witness.

103
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,300
All right.

104
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,579
So the basic idea, like you said, is we have to tell a story.

105
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,560
My story is that you burned down my house and you say, no, I didn't prove it.

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
I say, I can.

107
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,000
Someone saw you with a lighter.

108
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:45,920
Okay.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
So this person is my witness.

110
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,980
That means that he or she saw what happened.

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,480
So someone who sees a crime is a witness to that crime.

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,939
Very good.

113
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,600
So a lot of people are in the courtroom.

114
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:00,939
A lot of things are happening.

115
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:08,360
So I think we should listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back to look at some more words on Language Takeaway Part 2.

116
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:21,620
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Robert Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit.

117
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,160
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

118
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,139
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

119
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,060
People who claimed the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

120
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:35,519
I feel sorry for these victims.

121
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:36,740
I really do.

122
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:39,279
But my client is innocent.

123
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,819
Let's look at the facts.

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:51,060
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

125
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,420
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

126
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,920
There is no evidence.

127
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,019
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving your verdict.

128
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,540
Look at the facts.

129
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:09,319
Look at the evidence.

130
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,519
My client is innocent.

131
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,740
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

132
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,319
Yes, Your Honor.

133
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,699
Our verdict is not guilty.

134
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,680
Thank you so much.

135
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,560
You were great.

136
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:25,639
Thank you for all your hard work.

137
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:27,339
You're welcome, Robert.

138
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,860
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

139
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,259
Take care of yourself, okay?

140
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,139
Thanks once again.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,439
Hey, where's my wallet?

142
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,899
I love it when we do this.

143
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:40,839
So many words.

144
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,480
So much language to take away.

145
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,439
That's right.

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,439
So now we're going to take a look at the second part of language takeaway, where we have another set of four words that we want to take a look at.

147
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:53,339
Language takeaway.

148
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,360
All right, the first is actually two words.

149
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,759
We have two opposites, okay?

150
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,500
So you said earlier, the jury has to make a decision.

151
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,779
The jury has to decide, is the defendant innocent or guilty?

152
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:07,420
Okay.

153
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,300
These are two important adjectives.

154
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:09,680
Innocent.

155
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,360
What does this mean?

156
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,899
So if he is innocent, that means he did not commit the crime.

157
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,500
He is not responsible for what happened.

158
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,120
He did not steal the wallets.

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,720
Okay, so we often say babies are so innocent.

160
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,319
Right.

161
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,240
They can't do anything.

162
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,339
They can't do anything wrong.

163
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:23,819
Right.

164
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,800
So guilty would be the opposite.

165
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,699
That's right.

166
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:32,980
So usually when someone is guilty, they're sad, they feel bad.

167
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,600
You want them to pay you.

168
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,440
And they go to jail.

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,120
Yeah, in bad situations, they go to jail.

170
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,720
If you burn down my house, of course you're going to go to jail.

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,620
All right, so guilty means you did a crime.

172
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,759
You did a bad thing.

173
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:48,980
So we talked about the prosecution and the defense of the defendant.

174
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:59,039
And what happens is they also present some key elements that will prove if the person is innocent or guilty, and that those elements are called evidence.

175
00:08:59,580 --> 00:08:59,799
That's right.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,100
So back to this idea, we tell a story.

177
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,200
Maybe a witness can help us tell our story.

178
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,639
But as you say, evidence is stuff.

179
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
It's things.

180
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:13,620
So in the case of the house, I could say you have matches and you smell like smoke and oil.

181
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,379
This is evidence for me to use to show that you are guilty.

182
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:17,759
Right.

183
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:20,000
So in this case, do we have any evidence?

184
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,500
There's no evidence, says the defendant.

185
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:24,860
Right.

186
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,379
All right.

187
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,759
So evidence is proof.

188
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,340
It's proof.

189
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,279
It's physical proof.

190
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,059
And most of the times when you see movies or TV shows, they will find, I don't know, like maybe a fingerprint.

191
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:38,019
That's evidence or somebody's glasses.

192
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,039
A cell phone.

193
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,200
All right.

194
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:40,960
So evidence.

195
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,840
This is very important when you want to build a case.

196
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,879
Finally, at the end of a trial, we have a verdict.

197
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,559
Now, what is a verdict?

198
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:57,360
So a verdict is a final decision or a conclusion in which the jury says, yeah, the person is guilty or he's not guilty, he's innocent.

199
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,179
So we use this word usually to reach a verdict.

200
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,059
The jury reaches a verdict.

201
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,559
Now, it's interesting why we say to reach, because a jury is not just one person.

202
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
A jury is many people.

203
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,940
And so these people have to decide together.

204
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,899
They have to argue.

205
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,320
They have to make a conclusion that everyone agrees on.

206
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,659
And this is to reach a conclusion, to reach a verdict, because they have to travel there.

207
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,559
They have to go together and figure it out.

208
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:23,960
Right.

209
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:25,399
That's very, very important.

210
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,080
So the jury reaches a verdict.

211
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,320
And we did have one other phrase that's very interesting.

212
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,899
It doesn't quite fit with the other ones.

213
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,899
We heard this phrase from the defendant.

214
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:41,860
The lawyer says, so these so-called witnesses didn't actually see anything.

215
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,399
What is so-called?

216
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,340
So he's being sarcastic when he uses this phrase.

217
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:47,820
So-called, right?

218
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,159
That's why even his tone changes, these so-called witnesses.

219
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,700
So it's a way of expressing sarcasm.

220
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,779
He's saying, they say they are witnesses, but they're not really, because they didn't see anything.

221
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,120
Right.

222
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:04,539
So so-called means you say that they are, but they're not really.

223
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,100
Right.

224
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,000
I could also say, your so-called lawyer thinks he can help you, but he can't.

225
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:10,220
Right.

226
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,779
That means, I don't think your lawyer is very good.

227
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,259
I don't think he's a real lawyer.

228
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:14,600
Right.

229
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,580
Or sometimes people say, my so-called friend stood me up last night.

230
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,559
Oh, so it's not really a friend.

231
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,460
He's not really a friend.

232
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,980
Exactly.

233
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,120
So-called.

234
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,639
All right.

235
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:24,399
That's another good one.

236
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,620
Let's listen to this dialogue one more time.

237
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,259
Really think about some of the words you heard today, and we'll be back in a moment.

238
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:44,860
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Robert Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit.

239
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,399
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

240
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:52,440
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

241
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,240
People who claimed the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

242
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,779
I feel sorry for these victims.

243
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,000
I really do.

244
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,519
But my client is innocent.

245
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,059
Let's look at the facts.

246
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:14,279
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

247
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,759
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

248
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,120
There is no evidence.

249
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,220
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving your verdict.

250
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,799
Look at the facts.

251
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,539
Look at the evidence.

252
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,720
My client is innocent.

253
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,919
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

254
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,460
Yes, Your Honor.

255
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,919
Our verdict is not guilty.

256
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,720
Thank you so much.

257
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,600
You were great.

258
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,679
Thank you for all your hard work.

259
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,379
You're welcome, Robert.

260
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,879
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

261
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,279
Take care of yourself, okay?

262
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,200
Thanks once again.

263
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,379
Hey, where's my wallet?

264
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,080
All right, we're back.

265
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:19,259
So now, a very interesting situation with the courtroom dramas, and I've heard that all the people in the jury have to agree in order for them to reach a verdict, right?

266
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:27,100
So if one of them is not convinced that the person is, for example, guilty, then they have to keep on deliberating.

267
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,879
That's the word, right?

268
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:28,419
That's right.

269
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,100
So basically, the jury is always alone in a room.

270
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:41,059
Maybe they have a guard, but they're not supposed to talk to journalists or friends of the defendant or anyone because their decision is supposed to be pure.

271
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,399
So they talk, and sometimes it takes 10 minutes.

272
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:55,360
Everyone agrees this person is guilty or this person is innocent, but sometimes they don't agree, and it can be one day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month trying to decide what to do.

273
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,200
I remember in the O.J.

274
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,919
Simpson case, the jury took a long time to figure out what they were going to do.

275
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:09,759
Now, we said that the jury are common citizens, they're normal people, so what happens in their jobs if they can't go to work because they're doing this?

276
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:25,879
Well, in America, this job is called jury duty, and so someone will send you a letter and they say, listen, you need to come do jury duty, and you help be a part of the jury, and your job, they can't make you come because this is a service for the government.

277
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,179
So it's above everything else.

278
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:28,600
It's above.

279
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,899
You get your normal pay.

280
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:30,740
There's no problem.

281
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,820
You just don't work.

282
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,559
Okay, so they can't fire you if you're in jury duty for like five days or a month or whatever.

283
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,379
No, they can't.

284
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,100
That's illegal.

285
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,500
Wow, that's really interesting.

286
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,460
But a lot of people I've heard don't like to go to jury duty for some reason.

287
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,440
Is it tedious?

288
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,139
No, it's probably very boring.

289
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,500
I've never done it, but it's probably very boring.

290
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:49,860
I would imagine so.

291
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,340
All right, well, that's a very interesting topic.

292
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,840
I'm sure in your countries, laws are handled differently.

293
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,240
Maybe you don't have a courtroom.

294
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,179
Maybe you have like in England, people wear wigs and black robes.

295
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:05,080
So let us know how it works in your countries.

296
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,039
We'll see everyone at our website, EnglishPod.com.

297
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,360
And of course, if you have any questions or comments, you can leave those there as well.

298
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,639
See you on the website and happy studies.

299
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,200
Bye, everyone.
