00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Robert Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
People who claimed the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I feel sorry for these victims, I really do.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But my client is innocent.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's look at the facts.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There is no evidence.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving your verdict.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Look at the facts.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Look at the evidence.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
My client is innocent.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, Your Honor.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Our verdict is not guilty.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you so much.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You were great.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you for all your hard work.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're welcome, Robert.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Take care of yourself, okay?

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thanks once again.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, where's my wallet?
