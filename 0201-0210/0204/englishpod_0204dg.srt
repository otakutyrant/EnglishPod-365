00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:13,720
Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my client, Robert Malone, has been accused of a crime he did not commit.

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,260
The prosecution has accused my client of being a pickpocket.

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,219
I know we have heard the testimony of many people here today.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,199
People who claimed the defendant, my client, stole their wallets.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,859
I feel sorry for these victims, I really do.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,440
But my client is innocent.

8
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:34,939
Let's look at the facts.

9
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:43,140
Number one, these so-called witnesses did not actually see the defendant steal anything.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,600
Number two, when the police stopped him, he did not have any of the stolen wallets.

11
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,000
There is no evidence.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,179
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I ask you to think carefully before giving your verdict.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,640
Look at the facts.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,340
Look at the evidence.

15
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,599
My client is innocent.

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,780
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?

17
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,359
Yes, Your Honor.

18
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:13,780
Our verdict is not guilty.

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,579
Thank you so much.

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,459
You were great.

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,540
Thank you for all your hard work.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,260
You're welcome, Robert.

23
00:01:21,379 --> 00:01:23,739
I knew you were innocent, so my job was easy.

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,159
Take care of yourself, okay?

25
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,040
Thanks once again.

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,239
Hey, where's my wallet?
