00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And my name is Catherine, and today we're talking about office stuff, things in your office.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We are talking about secrets in the office or maybe specific little things that people talk about behind other people's back.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, bad things then.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this is an elementary level lesson.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Before we get going, though, let's take a look at a phrase in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All right, so the phrase for today is actually the same as the title for this lesson, and that's office gossip.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, you all know what an office is.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is gossip?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So to gossip means to talk about other people secretly or behind their backs, or maybe talk about other people's problems or private things.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So oh, my God, did you hear?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
John is totally going to break up with her.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So you're talking about people without them knowing.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So you're talking about their private things, their relationships, maybe you're even maybe criticizing them.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So office gossip is talking about people in your office without them knowing, so saying bad things about them.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So without any more delay, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hmm, no.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Go on, tell me what's the latest office gossip?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No way.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's so two faced.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can't believe anything she says.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hey, guys, what are you two whispering about?

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, hi, Paula.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How are you?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've got some good news.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm getting a promotion.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Congratulations.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, you're the best.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right, we're back.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So we have four key words that we want to look at from this gossip dialogue.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So why don't we take a look at those now in Language Takeaway?

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Okay, the first word is rumor.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Rumor.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now this is an interesting word about gossip.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, a rumor.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So a rumor is a story that might or might not be true.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Right.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, so I heard a rumor that they broke up yesterday.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay, so you're not sure if they broke up or no one has told you for a fact.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, it means I probably heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who doesn't really know.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Right, so rumors are maybe guesses about people and you don't know if they're true.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You see this a lot with famous people, movie stars.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They always talk about rumors that maybe they got married in secret or something.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Exactly.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There's a rumor that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are breaking up.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, so we don't know if it's true.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Rumor.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's a rumor.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So now the rumor that they heard was that this girl Paula is getting a promotion.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Promotion.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is an important office word.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This means to be offered a better job in your company.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That means to move up.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
To move up, right.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All right, so this is a noun.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You get a promotion, right?

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, I got a promotion last year, which also meant I got more money.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, awesome.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So that is a promotion.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Now, when they were talking about the promotion, the girl said, oh, I can't believe, the guy said, and Eric said, I can't believe she's getting a promotion.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
She's so two-faced.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Two-faced.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So think about what this means.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To have two faces, to be two-faced means to have two different sides to your personality, a good one and a bad one.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, so like, I could be very nice to Marco.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Marco, wow, you look so good today.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're such a nice guy.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She's a hard worker.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then, oh, my God, Marco is such an idiot.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He's like never working and he's always on the phone.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, hi, Marco.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That is two-faced.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's very good.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right, so two-faced means to have two different sides to your personality.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Now, it's interesting the way that you use this word.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You say two-faced, right?

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So you have to add the E-D at the end.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't say he is two-faced or he has two-faced.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, it's an adjective.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So he's two-faced.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She is two-faced.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, two-faced.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't like people who are two-faced.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, very good.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And we have one final word and it's actually a verb.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
When people talk like this, when they're talking like this, they're talking quietly, very quietly.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
To whisper.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, so what are you whispering about?

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Uh-oh, so usually when people are whispering, they're talking about a rumor.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right, or they're talking in secret.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't want somebody else to hear you.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Right, so when you want to be very quiet, like at the movie theater, you whisper.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Whisper.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so those are our four words for language takeaway.

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to take a look at a couple of phrases.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Psst, psst.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hmm?

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No?

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Go on, tell me.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's the latest office gossip?

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No way, but she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She's so two-faced, you can't believe anything she says.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, hi Paula, how are you?

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've got some good news.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm getting a promotion.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Congratulations!

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes, you're the best.

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right, we're back.

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So now we have three key phrases from this great dialogue on Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fluency Builder.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So this first one is the beginning to any great rumor.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We say, have you heard?

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Right, so have you heard?

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Have you heard that she got a promotion?

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Right, you're not really asking, right?

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Although it is a question, have you heard?

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But you're not really expecting an answer.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This means, I'm going to tell you some gossip.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Right.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Have you heard?

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because maybe I did, maybe I didn't, but I'm still going to say it.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She's still going to say it anyway.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So usually you can say, uh, what?

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Right?

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or in this case, Eric goes, no, go on, tell me what's the latest office gossip.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So obviously he knows it's going to be gossip.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Have you heard?

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And so the next thing Pam says is, well, you didn't hear this from me.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, what does this mean?

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is typical.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is a way of saying, okay, don't tell anyone that I told you.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So you can tell people, but just don't tell them that I said that this happened because Pam doesn't want to get in trouble.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She doesn't want anyone to know that she was giving out rumors.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So that's why she's starting out with, well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is, okay, so you can, so this is a way of saying, all right, don't tell anyone that I told you, you didn't hear this from me.

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And also you can go, you can say, but the rumor is, or you can say, but rumor has it.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, rumor has it that Paula is getting a promotion.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So you can go both ways.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And now he exclaims something that's very strange.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you just look at it from these two words, no way.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No way.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What is no way?

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, in this context, no way means really?

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wow.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm surprised.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So it's a way to express surprise.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But be careful because there's another meaning to this phrase.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
For example, Marco, could you help me out and get the groceries from the car?

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No way.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Huh?

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That means no.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No way.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That means no.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But also if you say it like, oh, no way, you're saying, wow, that's so interesting.

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So it can be an expression of surprise or it can be a way of saying no very firmly.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No way.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Exactly.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So three great phrases there.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Very interesting dialogue about gossip.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Very common in the office environment.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And we'll be back in a little bit.

181
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go on.

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Tell me, what's the latest office gossip?

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No way, but she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She's so two-faced.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You can't believe anything she says.

189
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, hi Paula.

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How are you?

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've got some good news.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm getting a promotion.

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Congratulations.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes, you're the best.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, we're back.

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So office gossip is generally, well, it's common.

199
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It happens in every office, but I think that it's good to avoid too much gossip because sometimes people's feelings can get hurt.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, it's actually very interesting because usually the bigger the company is, I think more gossip starts to spread because, you know, they're departments.

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So you got the marketing department, the finance department.

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So you're like, oh, Kathy from finance, she slept with Tom from marketing and stuff like that.

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then you have the gossip about the bosses.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Right.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did you see he totally left for the weekend, but his wife was at home?

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah.

207
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, and also one of the situations where a lot of rumors and office gossip starts to come up is office parties or the office Christmas parties where people maybe are drinking or something happens and a lot of rumors start to spread.

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And they're more relaxed than usual.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
They do things they wouldn't normally do.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Absolutely.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So maybe we could open this up to you.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Is there a common rumor or office gossip that you hear in your office?

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Or is there that one secretary or guy that's always spreading rumors and gossiping?

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And don't use any real names.

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can just tell us general stories.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
