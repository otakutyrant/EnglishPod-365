00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,679
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,559
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,960
And my name is Catherine, and today we're talking about office stuff, things in your office.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:21,960
We are talking about secrets in the office or maybe specific little things that people talk about behind other people's back.

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:23,300
Okay, bad things then.

7
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:24,920
So this is an elementary level lesson.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,420
Before we get going, though, let's take a look at a phrase in today's vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:40,460
All right, so the phrase for today is actually the same as the title for this lesson, and that's office gossip.

10
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,719
Okay, you all know what an office is.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,060
What is gossip?

12
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:56,140
So to gossip means to talk about other people secretly or behind their backs, or maybe talk about other people's problems or private things.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,340
So oh, my God, did you hear?

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,179
John is totally going to break up with her.

15
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,599
So you're talking about people without them knowing.

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,939
So you're talking about their private things, their relationships, maybe you're even maybe criticizing them.

17
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:12,700
That's right.

18
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:19,400
So office gossip is talking about people in your office without them knowing, so saying bad things about them.

19
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:20,000
Right.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So without any more delay, why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time?

21
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,980
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

22
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:39,280
Hmm, no.

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,819
Go on, tell me what's the latest office gossip?

24
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:48,859
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,400
No way.

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,799
But she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,099
She's so two faced.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,959
You can't believe anything she says.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,219
Hey, guys, what are you two whispering about?

30
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,060
Oh, hi, Paula.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,379
How are you?

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,980
I've got some good news.

33
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm getting a promotion.

34
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:06,840
Congratulations.

35
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,539
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

36
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,300
Yes, you're the best.

37
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,460
All right, we're back.

38
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,060
So we have four key words that we want to look at from this gossip dialogue.

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,180
So why don't we take a look at those now in Language Takeaway?

40
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,879
Language Takeaway.

41
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,060
Okay, the first word is rumor.

42
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:39,159
Rumor.

43
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:41,759
Now this is an interesting word about gossip.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah, a rumor.

45
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,699
So a rumor is a story that might or might not be true.

46
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:47,219
Right.

47
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay, so I heard a rumor that they broke up yesterday.

48
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,960
Okay, so you're not sure if they broke up or no one has told you for a fact.

49
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,879
No, it means I probably heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who heard it from someone else who doesn't really know.

50
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,580
Right, so rumors are maybe guesses about people and you don't know if they're true.

51
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,400
You see this a lot with famous people, movie stars.

52
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,580
They always talk about rumors that maybe they got married in secret or something.

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,139
Exactly.

54
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,560
There's a rumor that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are breaking up.

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,219
Okay, so we don't know if it's true.

56
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,139
Rumor.

57
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:23,080
That's a rumor.

58
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,020
So now the rumor that they heard was that this girl Paula is getting a promotion.

59
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,120
Promotion.

60
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,819
This is an important office word.

61
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:36,699
This means to be offered a better job in your company.

62
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,979
That means to move up.

63
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,000
To move up, right.

64
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,699
All right, so this is a noun.

65
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,800
You get a promotion, right?

66
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,860
Yes, I got a promotion last year, which also meant I got more money.

67
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,360
Okay, awesome.

68
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,900
So that is a promotion.

69
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:59,240
Now, when they were talking about the promotion, the girl said, oh, I can't believe, the guy said, and Eric said, I can't believe she's getting a promotion.

70
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:01,599
She's so two-faced.

71
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,020
Two-faced.

72
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,580
So think about what this means.

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,800
To have two faces, to be two-faced means to have two different sides to your personality, a good one and a bad one.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,580
Okay, so like, I could be very nice to Marco.

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,899
Marco, wow, you look so good today.

76
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,779
You're such a nice guy.

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,360
She's a hard worker.

78
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,699
And then, oh, my God, Marco is such an idiot.

79
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,079
He's like never working and he's always on the phone.

80
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:26,040
Oh, hi, Marco.

81
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:27,980
That is two-faced.

82
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,939
That's very good.

83
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,319
All right, so two-faced means to have two different sides to your personality.

84
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,360
Now, it's interesting the way that you use this word.

85
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,759
You say two-faced, right?

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,860
So you have to add the E-D at the end.

87
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,579
You can't say he is two-faced or he has two-faced.

88
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,040
No, it's an adjective.

89
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,319
So he's two-faced.

90
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,899
She is two-faced.

91
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,279
Okay, two-faced.

92
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,199
I don't like people who are two-faced.

93
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:51,879
Okay, very good.

94
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,199
And we have one final word and it's actually a verb.

95
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,279
When people talk like this, when they're talking like this, they're talking quietly, very quietly.

96
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,139
To whisper.

97
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,980
Okay, so what are you whispering about?

98
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,420
Uh-oh, so usually when people are whispering, they're talking about a rumor.

99
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,899
Right, or they're talking in secret.

100
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,839
You don't want somebody else to hear you.

101
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,360
Right, so when you want to be very quiet, like at the movie theater, you whisper.

102
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,100
Whisper.

103
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,639
Okay, so those are our four words for language takeaway.

104
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:27,319
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to take a look at a couple of phrases.

105
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,399
Psst, psst.

106
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,720
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

107
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,519
Hmm?

108
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:38,019
No?

109
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,100
Go on, tell me.

110
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:40,519
What's the latest office gossip?

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,579
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

112
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,560
No way, but she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

113
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,800
She's so two-faced, you can't believe anything she says.

114
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,000
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

115
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,459
Oh, hi Paula, how are you?

116
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,959
I've got some good news.

117
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,480
I'm getting a promotion.

118
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:06,819
Congratulations!

119
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,519
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,279
Yes, you're the best.

121
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,800
All right, we're back.

122
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,879
So now we have three key phrases from this great dialogue on Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,959
Fluency Builder.

124
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:28,040
So this first one is the beginning to any great rumor.

125
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:30,300
We say, have you heard?

126
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:32,259
Right, so have you heard?

127
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,480
Have you heard that she got a promotion?

128
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:38,439
Right, you're not really asking, right?

129
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,240
Although it is a question, have you heard?

130
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:43,339
But you're not really expecting an answer.

131
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:46,899
This means, I'm going to tell you some gossip.

132
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:47,759
Right.

133
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,579
Have you heard?

134
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,959
Because maybe I did, maybe I didn't, but I'm still going to say it.

135
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
She's still going to say it anyway.

136
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,740
So usually you can say, uh, what?

137
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,319
Right?

138
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Or in this case, Eric goes, no, go on, tell me what's the latest office gossip.

139
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,620
So obviously he knows it's going to be gossip.

140
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,040
Have you heard?

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,319
All right.

142
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,720
And so the next thing Pam says is, well, you didn't hear this from me.

143
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,600
Okay, what does this mean?

144
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,379
This is typical.

145
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:17,060
This is a way of saying, okay, don't tell anyone that I told you.

146
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,639
So you can tell people, but just don't tell them that I said that this happened because Pam doesn't want to get in trouble.

147
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,019
She doesn't want anyone to know that she was giving out rumors.

148
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:41,040
So that's why she's starting out with, well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is, okay, so you can, so this is a way of saying, all right, don't tell anyone that I told you, you didn't hear this from me.

149
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,600
And also you can go, you can say, but the rumor is, or you can say, but rumor has it.

150
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,899
Oh, rumor has it that Paula is getting a promotion.

151
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,480
So you can go both ways.

152
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,259
And now he exclaims something that's very strange.

153
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,300
If you just look at it from these two words, no way.

154
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,259
No way.

155
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,180
What is no way?

156
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,279
Well, in this context, no way means really?

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,680
Wow.

158
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,240
Right.

159
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm surprised.

160
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,399
So it's a way to express surprise.

161
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,300
That's right.

162
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,040
But be careful because there's another meaning to this phrase.

163
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,420
For example, Marco, could you help me out and get the groceries from the car?

164
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,180
No way.

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:20,879
Huh?

166
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:21,480
Okay.

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
That means no.

168
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:23,720
Okay.

169
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,560
No way.

170
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,560
That means no.

171
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,019
But also if you say it like, oh, no way, you're saying, wow, that's so interesting.

172
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:37,519
So it can be an expression of surprise or it can be a way of saying no very firmly.

173
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,000
No way.

174
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,460
Exactly.

175
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,379
All right.

176
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,279
So three great phrases there.

177
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,559
Very interesting dialogue about gossip.

178
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,059
Very common in the office environment.

179
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,320
So why don't we listen to the dialogue again?

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,220
And we'll be back in a little bit.

181
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,659
Hey, Eric, have you heard?

182
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:04,720
No.

183
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:05,740
Go on.

184
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,519
Tell me, what's the latest office gossip?

185
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:14,580
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is Paula is getting a promotion.

186
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:19,539
No way, but she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,879
She's so two-faced.

188
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,700
You can't believe anything she says.

189
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,980
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

190
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,759
Oh, hi Paula.

191
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,200
How are you?

192
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,720
I've got some good news.

193
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm getting a promotion.

194
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,559
Congratulations.

195
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,279
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,019
Yes, you're the best.

197
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,559
Okay, we're back.

198
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,779
So office gossip is generally, well, it's common.

199
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:59,879
It happens in every office, but I think that it's good to avoid too much gossip because sometimes people's feelings can get hurt.

200
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:09,539
Yeah, it's actually very interesting because usually the bigger the company is, I think more gossip starts to spread because, you know, they're departments.

201
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,539
So you got the marketing department, the finance department.

202
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:18,519
So you're like, oh, Kathy from finance, she slept with Tom from marketing and stuff like that.

203
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,279
Then you have the gossip about the bosses.

204
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:20,820
Right.

205
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,059
Did you see he totally left for the weekend, but his wife was at home?

206
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:26,879
Yeah.

207
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:42,320
So, and also one of the situations where a lot of rumors and office gossip starts to come up is office parties or the office Christmas parties where people maybe are drinking or something happens and a lot of rumors start to spread.

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,960
And they're more relaxed than usual.

209
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,860
They do things they wouldn't normally do.

210
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:46,639
Absolutely.

211
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,899
So maybe we could open this up to you.

212
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
Is there a common rumor or office gossip that you hear in your office?

213
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,220
Or is there that one secretary or guy that's always spreading rumors and gossiping?

214
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,559
And don't use any real names.

215
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,740
You can just tell us general stories.

216
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
