EnglishPod.com Hey, Eric, have you heard?

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,060
No?

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,560
Go on, tell me.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,000
What's the latest office gossip?

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:23,059
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is, Paula is getting a promotion.

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,000
No way, but she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,179
She's so two-faced, you can't believe anything she says.

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,460
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,659
Oh, hi Paula, how are you?

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,719
I've got some good news, I'm getting a promotion.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,039
Congratulations!

12
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,740
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

13
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,479
Yes, you're the best.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,500
Thanks for watching!
