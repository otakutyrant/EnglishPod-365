EnglishPod.com Hey, Eric, have you heard?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
No?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Go on, tell me.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What's the latest office gossip?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but the rumor is, Paula is getting a promotion.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
No way, but she's a terrible worker and you can't trust her.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
She's so two-faced, you can't believe anything she says.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hey guys, what are you two whispering about?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, hi Paula, how are you?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I've got some good news, I'm getting a promotion.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Congratulations!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Eric and I were just saying that you were the best person for the job.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, you're the best.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thanks for watching!
