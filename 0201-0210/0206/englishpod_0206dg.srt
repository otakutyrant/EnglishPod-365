00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:09,039
EnglishPod.com Charlie, do you have a second?

2
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:10,779
Yeah, what's up?

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,220
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,219
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:22,960
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly I think it's unfair.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,359
Unfair?

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:24,879
Why?

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,899
Well, you have long hair and use the hair dryer every morning.

9
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:29,440
I don't.

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,799
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:33,700
I don't.

12
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:35,100
You see what I'm getting at here?

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,619
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,299
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

15
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,500
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,560
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

17
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,700
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,659
Maybe you should move out.
