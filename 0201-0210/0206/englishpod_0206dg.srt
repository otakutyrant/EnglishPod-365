00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Charlie, do you have a second?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, what's up?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly I think it's unfair.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Unfair?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, you have long hair and use the hair dryer every morning.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I don't.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I don't.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You see what I'm getting at here?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Maybe you should move out.
