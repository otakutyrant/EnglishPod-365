1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,759
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,599
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:14,740
And I'm Katherine, and today we have an elementary-level lesson all about life with a roommate.

4
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:15,740
That's right.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:22,260
So sometimes during college, you have to live with a roommate because, you know, living alone is too expensive.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,059
Also, after college, I know that a lot of people who are just starting their jobs often live with their roommate to save some money.

7
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:30,699
That's right.

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,960
Or maybe your girlfriend could be considered kind of like your romantic roommate.

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,600
I hope not.

10
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,140
In the sense of today's lesson, we're talking about problems with a roommate.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,399
So let's listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,420
Charlie, do you have a second?

13
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:53,159
Yeah, what's up?

14
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,659
Well, I went and paid the bills today, and you still haven't given me your half.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

16
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,299
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly, I think it's unfair.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,400
Unfair?

18
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,260
Why?

19
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,299
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

20
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:11,840
I don't.

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,180
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,180
I don't.

23
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,480
You see what I'm getting at here?

24
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:20,019
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

25
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:24,719
You also take 30-minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

26
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,900
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,920
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,079
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,019
Maybe you should move out.

30
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,900
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,760
So we have a couple of different words that we're going to take a look at now in Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,519
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,219
So the first word is a dreaded word.

34
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,939
That means that most people don't like it.

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,879
They fear it.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,799
This is bills.

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,540
That's right.

38
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,780
You have to pay your bills.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,479
So a bill is the paper that tells you how much you have to pay.

40
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:09,280
That's right.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,900
So you can have a gas bill.

42
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,280
An electricity bill.

43
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:13,539
A cable bill.

44
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:16,639
Or even at the restaurant, you ask for the bill.

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,099
All right.

46
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,199
So this is the amount of money you need to pay.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:29,620
And usually at the end of the month, you receive many, many bills in the mail, and you have to pay the companies like the gas company and the electricity company.

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,180
That's right.

49
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,400
So those are bills.

50
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:33,240
Singular would be a bill.

51
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,620
And so this is how the argument starts.

52
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:43,900
The two roommates decide that they have to pay the bills, but they don't want to split the bills in half, go halves.

53
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,259
They have to pay their own.

54
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:49,520
And so one person says, listen, this isn't fair.

55
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,360
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

56
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:54,680
Okay.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,520
So we understand what it is to download something.

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,120
You download this podcast, but a torrent, what is that?

59
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,099
That's kind of technical.

60
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,039
That is.

61
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,680
So a torrent is a kind of file that you can download from the internet.

62
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:23,639
So basically when you want to download a movie or some music from the internet, you go to a website that will connect you to someone who owns this movie or book or music, and they'll have a special file that's called a torrent file, and that's what you download.

63
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,460
That's right.

64
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,400
So it's a new way of downloading files off the internet from many people, kind of like a peer sharing.

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,099
That's right.

66
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,159
So when one person disappears or goes offline, it shares you with another person.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,840
That's right.

68
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,560
So those are torrents.

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,259
And now, well, they kept arguing about, you have to pay this, I have to pay that.

70
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:44,599
So you said, you know what?

71
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,460
You should just move out.

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,539
Ooh.

73
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,379
So to move out, this is a phrase that has two words.

74
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,800
To move out, it means to leave this house forever, this apartment.

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,520
So that means to find a new place to live.

76
00:03:59,659 --> 00:03:59,819
Right.

77
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,500
So I can say, oh, I'm moving out this weekend.

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,539
That means I'm changing apartments.

79
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,180
Right.

80
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,620
Or my boyfriend just moved out.

81
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,539
Okay, so that means...

82
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,039
That was really sad.

83
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:10,960
He left your house.

84
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,340
Okay, so that is to move out.

85
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:19,420
And now we have a word that is more colloquial of how to say a house or an apartment.

86
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,319
This is place.

87
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,040
Okay.

88
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,920
So you just say a place.

89
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,939
So place normally is a location.

90
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:25,980
Okay.

91
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,379
Where is this place?

92
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,439
But we could say, hey, we're going to have dinner at my place.

93
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,519
Would you like to come?

94
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:35,339
So that means we're going to have dinner at my house.

95
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:35,759
Right.

96
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,360
My place.

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,100
His place.

98
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,819
His place.

99
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:40,139
Or you have a really nice place.

100
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:41,339
Okay.

101
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,980
So that means you have a really nice house.

102
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:43,579
Exactly.

103
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,259
Okay.

104
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,360
So four key words today when we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a little bit.

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
Charlie, do you have a second?

106
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,300
Yeah.

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,800
What's up?

108
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,220
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,420
Yeah.

110
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,240
I wanted to talk to you about that.

111
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,959
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly, I think it's unfair.

112
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:10,980
Unfair?

113
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:11,860
Why?

114
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,899
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

115
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:16,480
I don't.

116
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,819
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,459
I don't.

118
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,120
You see what I'm getting at here?

119
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,879
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

120
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,560
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

121
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,860
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

122
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,879
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

123
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,939
Maybe you should move out.

125
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,399
All right, we are back and we've got some great phrases today coming up in Fluency Builders.

126
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,959
Let's take a look at some of those.

127
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,920
Fluency Builder.

128
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:04,620
All right, so the first phrase that we have, very common, very, very common, but also very difficult for English learners to answer this question.

129
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,300
All right.

130
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,019
What's up?

131
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:06,660
What's up?

132
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,519
So if somebody says, what's up, what does that mean?

133
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,540
That means, what's going on?

134
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,300
What's new?

135
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:12,980
How are you?

136
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:13,920
How is it going?

137
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,600
Okay.

138
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:15,000
Hi.

139
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:17,220
So how should you answer this?

140
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:23,660
Okay, so think of what's up as being a question about what's new, what's happening.

141
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,139
You can say, what's up, oh, not much.

142
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:27,899
Not much.

143
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,620
Okay, what's up means, what's new, oh, not much is new.

144
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,120
Not much.

145
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:32,939
Everything is the same.

146
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:33,939
Or what's up?

147
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,740
You could say, hey, hi, how are you?

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
It's another way to say hi.

149
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:38,920
Okay.

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,060
But you can't say, the sky.

151
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:41,720
Right.

152
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:48,060
Or sometimes English learners will say, fine, thank you, because they think that what's up means, how are you?

153
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,399
No, that's different.

154
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,319
So you cannot say, fine, thank you, fine, well.

155
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,420
These are words that answer how are you questions, but this isn't a how are you question.

156
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,160
This is a what's new question.

157
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,959
What's new or hi.

158
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,100
So somebody says, what's up?

159
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,259
You can say, not much.

160
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,500
Or you can say, hey, what's up?

161
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,639
You can say, what's up back.

162
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:11,420
What's up?

163
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,259
What's up with you?

164
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,300
Yeah, what's up with you?

165
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,040
Okay.

166
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,579
So that's our first phrase.

167
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:24,480
Now, when the guy was talking about the hairdryer and the computer, he finished off that paragraph by saying, you see what I'm getting at here?

168
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,079
Okay, you're doing this.

169
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,300
You use the hairdryer.

170
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,519
You leave the computer on.

171
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,180
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

172
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,800
This phrase, do you see what I'm getting at?

173
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,420
It means, do you understand what I'm talking about?

174
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Do you see my point?

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,759
That means, I haven't said exactly what I mean, but you should understand what I'm saying.

176
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,740
So he's saying, you're wasting electricity.

177
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:50,120
You use all of these services more than I do.

178
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,399
And we could say, maybe Marco didn't get a good grade in his English test last week.

179
00:07:54,399 --> 00:08:02,740
And I say, listen, maybe it has to do with your study habits or how much you love video games or how little time you spend at school.

180
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,120
Do you see what I'm getting at?

181
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,920
So you're not saying directly that I don't study, you're just telling me the reasons maybe why as to I'm not studying.

182
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:11,680
Like a hint.

183
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,639
So that's what you say when you don't tell somebody directly what the problem is.

184
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,500
You say, you see what I'm getting at here?

185
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,439
Do you see what I'm getting at?

186
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,339
Getting at means hinting.

187
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,660
Okay.

188
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:33,899
And our last phrase, when they kept talking about the bills, one of the persons said, you are using way more gas and water than me.

189
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,960
So what about this way more?

190
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,379
Way more.

191
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,080
Way means much or a lot.

192
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,799
So we could say, you are using a lot more water than I am.

193
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,179
Or you're using way more water.

194
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,779
This is very spoken language.

195
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,980
This is not written language.

196
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,700
So don't write this down on your tests, but a way more means a lot more, much more.

197
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,080
Okay.

198
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,100
You can say Bob is way more attractive than Bill.

199
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,919
That's right.

200
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,700
Or this is way more interesting than that show.

201
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,360
Okay.

202
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,539
So you can say way more instead of much more or a lot more, but it's usually spoken English.

203
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,159
Exactly.

204
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:09,759
All right.

205
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,600
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit to talk a little bit more.

206
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:20,779
Charlie, do you have a second?

207
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,059
Yeah.

208
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,539
What's up?

209
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,980
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

210
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,159
Yeah.

211
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,019
I wanted to talk to you about that.

212
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,700
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly I think it's unfair.

213
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:35,740
Unfair?

214
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:36,620
Why?

215
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,679
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

216
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,240
I don't.

217
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:44,559
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

218
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,159
I don't.

219
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,879
You see what I'm getting at here?

220
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,379
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

221
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:54,080
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

222
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,279
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

223
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,320
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

224
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,460
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

225
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,360
Maybe you should move out.

226
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,940
So Marco, have you ever had any of these problems with a roommate?

227
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,519
I've actually stayed away from roommates because of issues like this.

228
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,940
You mean you have not had many roommates because you're afraid of this situation?

229
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,360
Yeah.

230
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:38,000
I've always actually tried to live on my own by myself, like in a small apartment or studio, or if I have to have a roommate, maybe just like one, not like a house full of roommates.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
Because I think the more people there are, the little bit more complicated it gets.

232
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,700
And if it's just two, you know, it's a little bit simpler.

233
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,919
This is true, although sometimes I think it depends on the people that you're sharing a house with.

234
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,659
I've had one awkward experience where people did not want to pay ever.

235
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,340
And they were always late with their payments and one situation where people were very good about it.

236
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,919
So always remembered and were very helpful.

237
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,120
So it really depends.

238
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:15,200
Yeah, I think it's hard to live with someone always, of course, even, you know, if you start living with your girlfriend or boyfriend or you get married, it's kind of different to live with someone, you know, so.

239
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,519
And especially money wise, I think it always complicates things with people.

240
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,320
Definitely.

241
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,399
So I think you're right, though.

242
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,159
If there's two people, it's very easy to share the bills.

243
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:32,159
But if there's five people or six people, it's very hard to find out who spent more money or what the rules are.

244
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:32,600
Yeah.

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,820
So it can get a little bit complicated.

246
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,759
But I'm sure a lot of our listeners have probably had roommates before, maybe in college, maybe even now.

247
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,720
So let's hear those experiences and maybe those good and bad stories about living with other people.

248
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,639
So please get in touch with us.

We hope to see you there.

252

Bye.
