1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I'm Katherine, and today we have an elementary-level lesson all about life with a roommate.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's right.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So sometimes during college, you have to live with a roommate because, you know, living alone is too expensive.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Also, after college, I know that a lot of people who are just starting their jobs often live with their roommate to save some money.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Or maybe your girlfriend could be considered kind of like your romantic roommate.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I hope not.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In the sense of today's lesson, we're talking about problems with a roommate.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's listen to this dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Charlie, do you have a second?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah, what's up?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, I went and paid the bills today, and you still haven't given me your half.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly, I think it's unfair.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Unfair?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You see what I'm getting at here?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You also take 30-minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Maybe you should move out.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we have a couple of different words that we're going to take a look at now in Language Takeaway.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So the first word is a dreaded word.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That means that most people don't like it.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
They fear it.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is bills.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's right.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You have to pay your bills.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So a bill is the paper that tells you how much you have to pay.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's right.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So you can have a gas bill.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
An electricity bill.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
A cable bill.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Or even at the restaurant, you ask for the bill.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All right.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So this is the amount of money you need to pay.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And usually at the end of the month, you receive many, many bills in the mail, and you have to pay the companies like the gas company and the electricity company.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So those are bills.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Singular would be a bill.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And so this is how the argument starts.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The two roommates decide that they have to pay the bills, but they don't want to split the bills in half, go halves.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They have to pay their own.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And so one person says, listen, this isn't fair.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So we understand what it is to download something.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You download this podcast, but a torrent, what is that?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's kind of technical.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That is.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So a torrent is a kind of file that you can download from the internet.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So basically when you want to download a movie or some music from the internet, you go to a website that will connect you to someone who owns this movie or book or music, and they'll have a special file that's called a torrent file, and that's what you download.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So it's a new way of downloading files off the internet from many people, kind of like a peer sharing.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So when one person disappears or goes offline, it shares you with another person.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So those are torrents.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And now, well, they kept arguing about, you have to pay this, I have to pay that.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So you said, you know what?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You should just move out.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ooh.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So to move out, this is a phrase that has two words.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
To move out, it means to leave this house forever, this apartment.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So that means to find a new place to live.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Right.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I can say, oh, I'm moving out this weekend.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That means I'm changing apartments.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Right.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Or my boyfriend just moved out.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, so that means...

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That was really sad.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He left your house.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, so that is to move out.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And now we have a word that is more colloquial of how to say a house or an apartment.

86
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is place.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So you just say a place.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So place normally is a location.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Where is this place?

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But we could say, hey, we're going to have dinner at my place.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Would you like to come?

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So that means we're going to have dinner at my house.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My place.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
His place.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
His place.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Or you have a really nice place.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So that means you have a really nice house.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Exactly.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So four key words today when we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a little bit.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Charlie, do you have a second?

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's up?

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I wanted to talk to you about that.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly, I think it's unfair.

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Unfair?

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why?

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You see what I'm getting at here?

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Maybe you should move out.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
All right, we are back and we've got some great phrases today coming up in Fluency Builders.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's take a look at some of those.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fluency Builder.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
All right, so the first phrase that we have, very common, very, very common, but also very difficult for English learners to answer this question.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All right.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's up?

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's up?

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So if somebody says, what's up, what does that mean?

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That means, what's going on?

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What's new?

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How are you?

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How is it going?

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Hi.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So how should you answer this?

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, so think of what's up as being a question about what's new, what's happening.

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can say, what's up, oh, not much.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Not much.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, what's up means, what's new, oh, not much is new.

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Not much.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Everything is the same.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Or what's up?

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You could say, hey, hi, how are you?

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's another way to say hi.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But you can't say, the sky.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Or sometimes English learners will say, fine, thank you, because they think that what's up means, how are you?

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, that's different.

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So you cannot say, fine, thank you, fine, well.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
These are words that answer how are you questions, but this isn't a how are you question.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is a what's new question.

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's new or hi.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So somebody says, what's up?

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can say, not much.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Or you can say, hey, what's up?

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can say, what's up back.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What's up?

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's up with you?

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah, what's up with you?

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So that's our first phrase.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now, when the guy was talking about the hairdryer and the computer, he finished off that paragraph by saying, you see what I'm getting at here?

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, you're doing this.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You use the hairdryer.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You leave the computer on.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This phrase, do you see what I'm getting at?

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It means, do you understand what I'm talking about?

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Do you see my point?

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That means, I haven't said exactly what I mean, but you should understand what I'm saying.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So he's saying, you're wasting electricity.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You use all of these services more than I do.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And we could say, maybe Marco didn't get a good grade in his English test last week.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And I say, listen, maybe it has to do with your study habits or how much you love video games or how little time you spend at school.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you see what I'm getting at?

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So you're not saying directly that I don't study, you're just telling me the reasons maybe why as to I'm not studying.

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Like a hint.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So that's what you say when you don't tell somebody directly what the problem is.

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You say, you see what I'm getting at here?

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you see what I'm getting at?

186
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Getting at means hinting.

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And our last phrase, when they kept talking about the bills, one of the persons said, you are using way more gas and water than me.

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So what about this way more?

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Way more.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Way means much or a lot.

192
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So we could say, you are using a lot more water than I am.

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Or you're using way more water.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is very spoken language.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is not written language.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So don't write this down on your tests, but a way more means a lot more, much more.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can say Bob is way more attractive than Bill.

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Or this is way more interesting than that show.

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So you can say way more instead of much more or a lot more, but it's usually spoken English.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Exactly.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,000
All right.

205
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit to talk a little bit more.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Charlie, do you have a second?

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What's up?

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, I went and paid the bills today and you still haven't given me your half.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I wanted to talk to you about that.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I agreed we would go halves on all the bills, but frankly I think it's unfair.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Unfair?

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why?

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, you have long hair and use the hairdryer every morning.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't.

217
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You leave your computer on all night downloading torrents.

218
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't.

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You see what I'm getting at here?

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You leave the air conditioner on day and night.

221
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You also take 30 minute showers, which means you're using way more gas and water than me.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, while we're on the subject, stop bringing your friends over for drinks every weekend.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You always leave a mess and keep me up all night.

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Maybe you should just move out and find another place.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Maybe you should move out.

226
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So Marco, have you ever had any of these problems with a roommate?

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I've actually stayed away from roommates because of issues like this.

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You mean you have not had many roommates because you're afraid of this situation?

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've always actually tried to live on my own by myself, like in a small apartment or studio, or if I have to have a roommate, maybe just like one, not like a house full of roommates.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Because I think the more people there are, the little bit more complicated it gets.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And if it's just two, you know, it's a little bit simpler.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is true, although sometimes I think it depends on the people that you're sharing a house with.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I've had one awkward experience where people did not want to pay ever.

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And they were always late with their payments and one situation where people were very good about it.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So always remembered and were very helpful.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So it really depends.

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yeah, I think it's hard to live with someone always, of course, even, you know, if you start living with your girlfriend or boyfriend or you get married, it's kind of different to live with someone, you know, so.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And especially money wise, I think it always complicates things with people.

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Definitely.

241
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So I think you're right, though.

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If there's two people, it's very easy to share the bills.

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But if there's five people or six people, it's very hard to find out who spent more money or what the rules are.

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So it can get a little bit complicated.

246
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
But I'm sure a lot of our listeners have probably had roommates before, maybe in college, maybe even now.

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So let's hear those experiences and maybe those good and bad stories about living with other people.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So please get in touch with us.

Bye.
