00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is it?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What do you mean?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What happened?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There are many factors that weigh in, but Nasdaq is down 200 points.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How is this possible?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I know, sir.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
On the other hand, you still have some high-yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do what you have to do.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
One other thing, don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If they find out, it's the end of this company.
