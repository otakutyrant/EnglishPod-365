00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,500
EnglishPod.com Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:10,779
What is it?

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,820
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,280
What do you mean?

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,140
What happened?

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,239
There are many factors that weigh in, but Nasdaq is down 200 points.

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,719
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,559
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

9
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,980
How is this possible?

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:38,759
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,119
I know, sir.

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,960
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:52,939
On the other hand, you still have some high-yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

14
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:57,780
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

15
00:00:58,539 --> 00:00:59,960
Do what you have to do.

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,000
One other thing, don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

17
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,319
If they find out, it's the end of this company.
