00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,459
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,219
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,919
My name is Katherine, and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all about money.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,740
That's right.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:20,500
We are going to talk about the stock market, so a very interesting topic, very current as well because, well, throughout the world, stock markets are not doing very well.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:38,060
That's right, and you may have seen on the television a lot of information about this, so today we're going to hopefully explain some of the things and phrases and words that you've been hearing, but first we've got a couple of important indicators, a couple of acronyms, actually, that you're going to hear about, so let's look at those in today's vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:40,740
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:46,340
All right, so the first word that we have on vocabulary preview is the NASDAQ, NASDAQ.

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,539
NASDAQ, N-A-S-D-A-Q, so this is basically the American stock market.

10
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,060
Right.

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:52,979
It's an acronym.

12
00:00:53,179 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, it's a really, really long acronym, so we're not going to get into it, but it is basically the American stock market where all these companies are trading stock, publicly traded companies.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,760
Right, so publicly traded companies, you're basically trading their stocks through NASDAQ.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:20,739
Right, and now the next one that we have is an indicator which tells us how well some companies or some stock are doing, and that's the Dow Jones indicator.

15
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,480
Dow Jones indicator.

16
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,120
So maybe if the Dow Jones is really low for something, we think, man, it's not doing so well.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,519
Right.

18
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:30,239
If it goes up, things are improving.

19
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:39,439
Right, so usually the Dow Jones has the, it's based upon the 50 biggest companies in the United States, the 50 biggest publicly traded companies.

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,019
Now you can divide it into industrial companies or pharmaceutical companies, et cetera, but in general, that's the indicator and how it works.

21
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:47,500
Great.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:55,719
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out how these words are used in context, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

23
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:04,819
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,180
What is it?

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,159
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,599
What do you mean?

27
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,500
What happened?

28
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,599
There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points.

29
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,060
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

30
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,879
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

31
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,340
How is this possible?

32
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:34,080
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.

33
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:35,460
I know, sir.

34
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,300
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

35
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:48,280
On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

36
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,159
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

37
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,340
Do what you have to do.

38
00:02:55,699 --> 00:02:56,259
One other thing.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,340
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

40
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,659
If they find out, it's the end of this company.

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,599
All right, we're back.

42
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:07,819
So a lot of interesting words there.

43
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,960
I think a lot of them were very specific to the stock market and maybe a little bit difficult.

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,000
So why don't we take a look at a couple of those and language takeaway.

45
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,979
Language takeaway.

46
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,020
Okay, so this first word is a very important word in banking and finance.

47
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,300
We talk about portfolios a lot.

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,500
So portfolio.

49
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:35,099
So basically a portfolio is the variety of things that you own.

50
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,419
For example, in the stock market, it could be stocks.

51
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,479
It could be bonds.

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,960
It can be mutual funds, et cetera.

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,139
Or for example, if you're a company, your product portfolio could be all the products that your company owns.

54
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:47,659
That's right.

55
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,039
So in this case, our portfolio is worth half what it was a week ago.

56
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,360
And so this is a sentence that means we've lost half of the money we invested.

57
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,560
All of our investments are in a portfolio.

58
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,620
We talk about them as a portfolio.

59
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,039
And when we lose money, we say our portfolio is worth less now than it was before.

60
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,699
Exactly.

61
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,800
And well, moving on, he starts to talk about the bull market and the bear market.

62
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,580
So what is this all about?

63
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,420
Well, a bull is an animal with horns and a bear is another animal.

64
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,240
So we're not talking about animals here.

65
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,139
We're talking about special finance phrases.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,860
So the bull market would be, again, talking about companies and trading.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,959
It would be maybe a market that's growing very rapidly.

68
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,220
That's very, very strong.

69
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,360
That's a bull market.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
So people often talk about China's bull market, right?

71
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,139
How China continues to grow and grow and grow and grow.

72
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,040
But a market that slows down, like the United States last year, would be a bear market.

73
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:46,420
Right.

74
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,579
So think of a bear.

75
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,500
Maybe it's sleeping.

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,660
It goes into hibernation.

77
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,079
That's a bear market.

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,779
So a slow market.

79
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,699
It's not really growing.

80
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:55,540
Very good.

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,439
But talking about a portfolio again, we might have stocks.

82
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,839
But in this case, the two people are talking about their bonds.

83
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,439
So he says, you still have some high-yield trash bonds and government bonds.

84
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,139
What's a high-yield bond and what's a trash bond?

85
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,839
Okay, so when we think about the word yield is how much it gives, right?

86
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,800
So how much we are getting from it.

87
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,980
So something that is high-yield means that you're getting a lot from it.

88
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:25,220
For example, this orange tree yields 300 oranges per year.

89
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,980
That's how much we get from it.

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,540
Exactly.

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,019
So we're getting 300 oranges.

92
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:30,279
That's how much it's yielding.

93
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:34,220
And so basically that's what yield means.

94
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:49,000
So when we talk about trash bonds, this on the other hand, it's a word that's maybe a little bit tricky, but a bond is a promise that you get from the seller that he's going to pay you back the money that you give him with interest, right?

95
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,939
But a trash bond is a very risky bond.

96
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:57,000
It means that the seller might not pay you back because, you know, he's still trying to get all the money.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,560
All right, but a high-yield trash bond means that you might make a lot of money from this bond unless, of course, it's not very dependable.

98
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,740
Exactly.

99
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,720
So it's risky.

100
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,259
Of course, since it's riskier, it has more yield.

101
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,060
Great.

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,060
So high-yield trash bond.

103
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,339
And then what about this?

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,680
They will give us liquidity to cut our losses.

105
00:06:18,019 --> 00:06:18,540
Liquidity.

106
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
We hear all about liquidity in finance.

107
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:21,459
Exactly.

108
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:28,019
Maybe in your company, the accountant will talk about this and that's basically just to have money cash in hand.

109
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,040
So you have money to pay things or to buy things, right?

110
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:32,699
Not with...

111
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,639
Okay, so it's available.

112
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,720
Available, yeah.

113
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,540
Not with credit.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,860
The opposite of credit.

115
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:37,959
Okay, liquidity.

116
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,639
And finally, instead, what are we going to do?

117
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,939
Let's think outside the box.

118
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,259
We could reinvest in emerging markets.

119
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,519
And this is a very hot topic lately, talking about emerging markets.

120
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,060
So to emerge means to come up, right?

121
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,620
To rise.

122
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,500
Yeah, to come out.

123
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,180
So it's almost like new or growing markets.

124
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:10,319
So in this case, a market, an emerging market would be, for example, the Southeast Asian market which is growing quickly or even you could say West African market.

125
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:13,720
We're talking about places in the world that aren't established.

126
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,319
They're not old and dependable.

127
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,420
They're new and exciting.

128
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,980
So they're coming up.

129
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,899
So that's an emerging market.

130
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,519
So a lot of very interesting words and phrases.

131
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,839
They're very related to our topic.

132
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,220
And so why don't we move on now?

133
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,519
Let's take a look at two key phrases on Fluency Builder.

134
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,240
Fluency Builder.

135
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,259
This first phrase is something we've heard a lot about in the last year or two with things not going so well in the world of finance.

136
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,120
The first one, here we go, to cut our losses.

137
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,740
Okay, so let's cut our losses.

138
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:55,819
So when you talk about cutting your losses, that means to try and stop losing money somehow, maybe sell early.

139
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,920
That's right.

140
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,819
So in this case, we're losing money.

141
00:07:58,899 --> 00:07:59,540
Let's stop now.

142
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,300
Let's stop everything.

143
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,259
Cut our losses.

144
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,399
That means cut them away.

145
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:03,439
Forget about them.

146
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,120
Throw them away.

147
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,079
And start again.

148
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,420
Okay, so we could say, my business is failing.

149
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,959
I'm going to cut my losses, sell the business, and start again.

150
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,439
Right.

151
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,639
That's exactly it.

152
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,899
So to cut your losses means to stop doing something, maybe sell it, and stop losing money.

153
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,019
Basically, you accept the fact that you lost it, you can't get it back, and you start again.

154
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:32,039
So when they were talking about investing in emerging markets, he said, well, maybe we could do this, and that would force us to think outside the box.

155
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, this is a great phrase, and you might hear this in meetings a lot or from your manager.

156
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,000
What's going on here is these two people are talking about how they lost a lot of money.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,720
The economy is bad, and they've been doing things in a normal way for a long time.

158
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,419
It's not working.

159
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,299
Let's think outside the box.

160
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,419
That means let's be creative.

161
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,580
Let's try and discover new ways of doing things that will yield positive results.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,259
That's right.

163
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:07,779
This is a very, very common phrase, very widely used in business or when you're talking about ideas is people tell you to think outside the box, to maybe break some of the rules, right?

164
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:08,360
Right.

165
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,120
Don't just think the way that you always do.

166
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,460
Don't do the same thing over and over.

167
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,639
Do something new.

168
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:14,399
Be creative.

169
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,679
Come up with something great.

170
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,559
So that's thinking outside the box.

171
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,139
Very good.

172
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,940
So a lot of great phrases there.

173
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,519
I think we've learned quite a bit.

174
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,980
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more about this very interesting topic.

175
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:39,519
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

176
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,779
What is it?

177
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,860
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

178
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:47,299
What do you mean?

179
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,159
What happened?

180
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,279
There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points.

181
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,759
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

182
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,539
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

183
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,019
How is this possible?

184
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:08,799
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.

185
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,159
I know, sir.

186
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,980
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

187
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:22,980
On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

188
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,840
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

189
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,980
Do what you have to do.

190
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,940
One other thing.

191
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,080
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

192
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,360
If they find out, it's the end of this company.

193
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,000
I remember being a little kid and watching TV with my parents.

194
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,720
On the news, there was always the business segment.

195
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,559
You'd always hear the NASDAQ is down 10 points.

196
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,200
The Dow Jones Industrial today is down 10 points.

197
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,100
Yesterday was up two.

198
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
That's an average of H.

199
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,679
It's very complicated, especially if you take a look also in the newspaper sometimes.

200
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,340
It shows you different publicly traded companies and it has a bunch of numbers.

201
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,419
It's a very interesting topic.

202
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,259
It's almost a science, I think.

203
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,220
Very much a science.

204
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:24,340
Some people have made a lot of money playing the stock market and trying to buy stocks when they're low, wait until they're high, sell them off and make tons.

205
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,799
It's pretty much analyzing risk, so making calculated decisions.

206
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:39,379
That's why they use all these formulas and all these different ratios and ways to ponder how much they should invest or what would they gain.

207
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,399
It's very, very interesting.

208
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:48,940
Many people compare it to gambling, but it's kind of like gambling but not really because you don't really depend on luck.

209
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,000
You kind of make calculated decisions.

210
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:59,259
Sometimes you're trading for big, big companies or even parts of big markets, like parts of entire countries' businesses.

211
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:06,679
A lot of people, for example, stockbrokers will invest a group of workers' retirement funds.

212
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,919
They will take those funds and be like, hey, you're maybe getting 5% from the bank for keeping your money there.

213
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,759
Give me the money and I'll give you 25% yield on your investment.

214
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,360
Obviously, they're playing not only their reputation but also with other people's life savings.

215
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:30,279
That's why a lot of people lost money when two years ago, the bubble really burst in a lot of areas like real estate.

216
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:38,539
Stock prices went down, the United States went into a recession, and all these people's retirement funds, their savings, they lost it.

217
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,440
You've got to be careful with this kind of stuff and do your homework.

218
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,460
That's about it for us today.

219
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,919
I hope that you've enjoyed this lesson.

All right.

We'll see everyone there.

223
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:50,559
Bye.

224
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:50,980
Bye.
