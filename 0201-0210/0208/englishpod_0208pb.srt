00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we've got an upper intermediate level lesson for you all about money.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We are going to talk about the stock market, so a very interesting topic, very current as well because, well, throughout the world, stock markets are not doing very well.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right, and you may have seen on the television a lot of information about this, so today we're going to hopefully explain some of the things and phrases and words that you've been hearing, but first we've got a couple of important indicators, a couple of acronyms, actually, that you're going to hear about, so let's look at those in today's vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
All right, so the first word that we have on vocabulary preview is the NASDAQ, NASDAQ.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
NASDAQ, N-A-S-D-A-Q, so this is basically the American stock market.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Right.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's an acronym.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, it's a really, really long acronym, so we're not going to get into it, but it is basically the American stock market where all these companies are trading stock, publicly traded companies.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Right, so publicly traded companies, you're basically trading their stocks through NASDAQ.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Right, and now the next one that we have is an indicator which tells us how well some companies or some stock are doing, and that's the Dow Jones indicator.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Dow Jones indicator.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So maybe if the Dow Jones is really low for something, we think, man, it's not doing so well.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Right.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If it goes up, things are improving.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Right, so usually the Dow Jones has the, it's based upon the 50 biggest companies in the United States, the 50 biggest publicly traded companies.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now you can divide it into industrial companies or pharmaceutical companies, et cetera, but in general, that's the indicator and how it works.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Great.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue and find out how these words are used in context, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is it?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you mean?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What happened?

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How is this possible?

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I know, sir.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do what you have to do.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
One other thing.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If they find out, it's the end of this company.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All right, we're back.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So a lot of interesting words there.

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think a lot of them were very specific to the stock market and maybe a little bit difficult.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So why don't we take a look at a couple of those and language takeaway.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Language takeaway.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, so this first word is a very important word in banking and finance.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We talk about portfolios a lot.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So portfolio.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So basically a portfolio is the variety of things that you own.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
For example, in the stock market, it could be stocks.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It could be bonds.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It can be mutual funds, et cetera.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Or for example, if you're a company, your product portfolio could be all the products that your company owns.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So in this case, our portfolio is worth half what it was a week ago.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And so this is a sentence that means we've lost half of the money we invested.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All of our investments are in a portfolio.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We talk about them as a portfolio.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And when we lose money, we say our portfolio is worth less now than it was before.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Exactly.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And well, moving on, he starts to talk about the bull market and the bear market.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So what is this all about?

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, a bull is an animal with horns and a bear is another animal.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So we're not talking about animals here.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We're talking about special finance phrases.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So the bull market would be, again, talking about companies and trading.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It would be maybe a market that's growing very rapidly.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's very, very strong.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's a bull market.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So people often talk about China's bull market, right?

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How China continues to grow and grow and grow and grow.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But a market that slows down, like the United States last year, would be a bear market.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So think of a bear.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Maybe it's sleeping.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It goes into hibernation.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's a bear market.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So a slow market.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's not really growing.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Very good.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But talking about a portfolio again, we might have stocks.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But in this case, the two people are talking about their bonds.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So he says, you still have some high-yield trash bonds and government bonds.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What's a high-yield bond and what's a trash bond?

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay, so when we think about the word yield is how much it gives, right?

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So how much we are getting from it.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So something that is high-yield means that you're getting a lot from it.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
For example, this orange tree yields 300 oranges per year.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's how much we get from it.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Exactly.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So we're getting 300 oranges.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's how much it's yielding.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And so basically that's what yield means.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So when we talk about trash bonds, this on the other hand, it's a word that's maybe a little bit tricky, but a bond is a promise that you get from the seller that he's going to pay you back the money that you give him with interest, right?

95
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But a trash bond is a very risky bond.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It means that the seller might not pay you back because, you know, he's still trying to get all the money.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All right, but a high-yield trash bond means that you might make a lot of money from this bond unless, of course, it's not very dependable.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Exactly.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So it's risky.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Of course, since it's riskier, it has more yield.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Great.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So high-yield trash bond.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And then what about this?

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They will give us liquidity to cut our losses.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Liquidity.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We hear all about liquidity in finance.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Exactly.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Maybe in your company, the accountant will talk about this and that's basically just to have money cash in hand.

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So you have money to pay things or to buy things, right?

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Not with...

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay, so it's available.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Available, yeah.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Not with credit.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The opposite of credit.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay, liquidity.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And finally, instead, what are we going to do?

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's think outside the box.

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We could reinvest in emerging markets.

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And this is a very hot topic lately, talking about emerging markets.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So to emerge means to come up, right?

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,000
To rise.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, to come out.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So it's almost like new or growing markets.

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So in this case, a market, an emerging market would be, for example, the Southeast Asian market which is growing quickly or even you could say West African market.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We're talking about places in the world that aren't established.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
They're not old and dependable.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They're new and exciting.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So they're coming up.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So that's an emerging market.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So a lot of very interesting words and phrases.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They're very related to our topic.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And so why don't we move on now?

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's take a look at two key phrases on Fluency Builder.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fluency Builder.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This first phrase is something we've heard a lot about in the last year or two with things not going so well in the world of finance.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The first one, here we go, to cut our losses.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay, so let's cut our losses.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So when you talk about cutting your losses, that means to try and stop losing money somehow, maybe sell early.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So in this case, we're losing money.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's stop now.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's stop everything.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Cut our losses.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That means cut them away.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Forget about them.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Throw them away.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And start again.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay, so we could say, my business is failing.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to cut my losses, sell the business, and start again.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's exactly it.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So to cut your losses means to stop doing something, maybe sell it, and stop losing money.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Basically, you accept the fact that you lost it, you can't get it back, and you start again.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So when they were talking about investing in emerging markets, he said, well, maybe we could do this, and that would force us to think outside the box.

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, this is a great phrase, and you might hear this in meetings a lot or from your manager.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's going on here is these two people are talking about how they lost a lot of money.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The economy is bad, and they've been doing things in a normal way for a long time.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not working.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's think outside the box.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That means let's be creative.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's try and discover new ways of doing things that will yield positive results.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's right.

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is a very, very common phrase, very widely used in business or when you're talking about ideas is people tell you to think outside the box, to maybe break some of the rules, right?

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Right.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't just think the way that you always do.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't do the same thing over and over.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do something new.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Be creative.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Come up with something great.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So that's thinking outside the box.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Very good.

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So a lot of great phrases there.

173
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think we've learned quite a bit.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more about this very interesting topic.

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sorry to bother you, sir, but I have some bad news.

176
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What is it?

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you mean?

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What happened?

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The Dow Jones indicator also suffered.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How is this possible?

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I know, sir.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
On the other hand, you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do what you have to do.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
One other thing.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If they find out, it's the end of this company.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I remember being a little kid and watching TV with my parents.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
On the news, there was always the business segment.

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You'd always hear the NASDAQ is down 10 points.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The Dow Jones Industrial today is down 10 points.

197
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yesterday was up two.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's an average of H.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's very complicated, especially if you take a look also in the newspaper sometimes.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It shows you different publicly traded companies and it has a bunch of numbers.

201
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a very interesting topic.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's almost a science, I think.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Very much a science.

204
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Some people have made a lot of money playing the stock market and trying to buy stocks when they're low, wait until they're high, sell them off and make tons.

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's pretty much analyzing risk, so making calculated decisions.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's why they use all these formulas and all these different ratios and ways to ponder how much they should invest or what would they gain.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's very, very interesting.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Many people compare it to gambling, but it's kind of like gambling but not really because you don't really depend on luck.

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You kind of make calculated decisions.

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Sometimes you're trading for big, big companies or even parts of big markets, like parts of entire countries' businesses.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
A lot of people, for example, stockbrokers will invest a group of workers' retirement funds.

212
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They will take those funds and be like, hey, you're maybe getting 5% from the bank for keeping your money there.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Give me the money and I'll give you 25% yield on your investment.

214
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Obviously, they're playing not only their reputation but also with other people's life savings.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's why a lot of people lost money when two years ago, the bubble really burst in a lot of areas like real estate.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Stock prices went down, the United States went into a recession, and all these people's retirement funds, their savings, they lost it.

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You've got to be careful with this kind of stuff and do your homework.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's about it for us today.

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I hope that you've enjoyed this lesson.

We'll see everyone there.

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Bye.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Bye.
