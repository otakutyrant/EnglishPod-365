EnglishPod.com What are you doing?

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,720
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,320
You're shopping for a pillow online?

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,640
That's absurd!

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,440
Why?

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,699
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

7
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:27,339
This way, I just search for it online, quick and easy.

8
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,480
I see.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,079
But how do you pay for it?

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,219
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

11
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,920
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively, and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

12
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:44,280
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,799
So how do you pay?

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:46,920
Do you need a credit card?

15
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,579
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

16
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,520
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,920
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,560
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,259
You can find anything.

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,060
Are you sure you want to start shopping online, though?

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,239
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

22
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,040
Let's do it!
