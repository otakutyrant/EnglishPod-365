EnglishPod.com What are you doing?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're shopping for a pillow online?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's absurd!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This way, I just search for it online, quick and easy.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I see.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But how do you pay for it?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively, and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So how do you pay?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you need a credit card?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can find anything.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Are you sure you want to start shopping online, though?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's do it!
