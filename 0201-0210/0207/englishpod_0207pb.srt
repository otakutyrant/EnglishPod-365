1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another lesson at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I am Catherine, and today we're talking about shopping online.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So this is an elementary-level lesson.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We are going to shop for things online.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So before we get started with this dialogue, let's take a look at one word we have for you on vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay, the word we're looking at today is eBay.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay, so this is a proper noun, it's an actual website, eBay.com.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's kind of like a store on the internet for people who want to buy used things.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay, so maybe if you have a TV that you don't want anymore, you go on eBay, you put pictures of it online, and you offer it and anyone can buy it.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So you can be a buyer, that means you buy things, or a seller, so you sell things.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So this is interesting.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Usually you find used things on eBay, but you can also find new things.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You can.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's kind of like the Chinese website Taobao.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've actually even seen people selling cars on eBay.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Cars?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I can't imagine buying a car on the internet.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Really?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, they have even very luxurious cars on eBay.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So we'll talk more about online shopping a little bit later on, but now why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll come back in just a little bit.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What are you doing?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're shopping for a pillow online?

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's absurd.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This way, I just search for it online, quick and easy.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I see.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But how do you pay for it?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, the website handles a point system, where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively, and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So how do you pay?

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you need a credit card?

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can find anything.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Are you sure you want to start shopping online, though?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's do it!

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
All right, we're back.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So now we have four key words for you on language takeaway.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Language takeaway.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The first word you might have already heard us use already, we're talking about going on the Internet to do something.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So we say, to go online.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So by saying that you are going online, you say that you are using the Internet.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So you can shop for something online.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Online means the Internet, right?

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
On the Internet.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So we don't say in the Internet.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We say we're on the Internet.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
For example, he's been on the Internet all day long.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want to use the computer.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, so I can say he's been online all day long.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, so that is online.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And when we go online and we are looking through different websites or maybe we are looking at items on eBay, we are browsing.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, the verb here is to browse.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now, to browse is to look at, but not carefully.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Just to look at with maybe the idea to shop or to buy later.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay, so you can use browse for online things, but you can also use it for physical things like you are in a shop, you are browsing.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So I can go to a clothing store and I can browse.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
For example, if the woman at the clothing store says, would you like to buy something?

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I say, no, I'm just browsing.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm just looking.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, very good.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And then when they were talking about eBay and how it works, the person mentioned that they have a point system.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right, a point system.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now, this is something you hear about a lot on websites these days.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
For example, many websites have different users.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And so how do I know which users or which, in this case, sellers are the best?

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, we have a point system.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
More points means better.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Fewer points means worse.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Right.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You might also call this a star system.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So basically, a point system is a way to show who is a very good community member and who is not.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And that takes us to our next word.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So if a person has a lot of points in their point system, that means they are trustworthy.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, trustworthy is an adjective.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He is trustworthy.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They are trustworthy.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This means that I can trust them.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They are reliable.

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So I don't think they will lie to me.

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't think they will cheat me.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So a person can be trustworthy.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A company can be trustworthy.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Or you could say, he never pays me back.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's not very trustworthy when I lend him money.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, very good.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So four key words there.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why don't we listen to them again in our dialogue, and we'll be back shortly.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So how do you pay?

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you need a credit card?

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can find anything.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you sure you want to start shopping online though?

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's do it.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
All right, we're back.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So now we have three key phrases that we saw in our dialogue.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well, the first phrase we have here is related to that last word we had, trustworthy.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Someone is not trustworthy if they will rip you off.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay, so it's a phrasal verb, to rip you off or to rip off.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
To rip someone off.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So they ripped him off.

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He ripped her off.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This means to steal money from someone or to cheat someone.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So maybe if a pair of shoes usually in a store costs $50 and then your friend sells them to you for $200, your friend ripped you off.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He ripped you off.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's not a good friend.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's not very trustworthy.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So now when they were talking about how safe it is to make purchases online, the person explained that it's pretty safe and that no one has ever hacked his information.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay, so this is an important verb that has to do with the Internet.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
To hack information is to steal information on the Internet.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So someone who hacks, who steals this information is called a hacker.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, and this is something that's very bad.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We want to go to secure and safe websites because we don't want people to hack our personal information.

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's right.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, so the verb is to hack.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And finally, in the end, when they were going to look for a sweater for a dog, the person said, you know what, this is great.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you sure you want to start to shop online?

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Once you do this, there is no turning back.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, I love this phrase.

152
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There's no turning back.

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So this is, well, you think about someone who's leaving.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You say there's no turning back.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can't go back.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You can't return to where you were.

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Right.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is something we say as a warning.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So listen, this is your final decision.

160
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you say yes, you cannot change your mind.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You cannot say no later.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So you can't turn back later.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's right.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So there's no turning back now.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, no turning back.

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Very good.

167
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Interesting phrases, key words, and everything.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So we should listen to this dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This way, I just search for it online, quick and easy.

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I see.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But how do you pay for it?

172
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively, and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

175
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So how do you pay?

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you need a credit card?

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You can find anything.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you sure you want to start shopping online, though?

183
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's do it.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Online Shopping All right, so now we're talking about online shopping.

186
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have you ever bought anything online, used your credit card online?

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I have.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I've used my credit card on Amazon.com to purchase books on the Internet, but I know that you are much more of a fan of online shopping.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You use the Chinese website Taobao all the time.

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah, well actually I wrote this dialogue and it's kind of based on something real because sometimes going to the stores, it can be great and you can see things and physically touch them, but I'm a little bit more practical.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I know exactly what I want or maybe I saw it.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So I don't want to have to go to the stores and deal with haggling or negotiating or sometimes it's even more expensive.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So from the comfort of my own home, just put in my debit card number and buy things online and I get it delivered overnight.

194
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, and you never go shopping now.

195
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, shopping you have to go to the clothing store for clothes, the video game store for video games, and on the Internet it's all in one place.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're at home, you're in your pajamas, you use your credit card.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And the cool thing is that you can even, sometimes you want to buy small things, like in this case maybe a pillow or you want to buy, like recently I bought some candles, some decorative candles.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So, I don't know, do you really want to go out downtown, look for the candle shop where you can get them?

199
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can just do it online.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Do it online.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let us know, do you shop on the Internet?

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you do, what kind of services do you use?

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What stores do you go to?

204
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let us know.

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
