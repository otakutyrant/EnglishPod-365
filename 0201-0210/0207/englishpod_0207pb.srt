00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:06,139
Hello, everyone, and welcome to another lesson at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,200
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:11,640
And I am Catherine, and today we're talking about shopping online.

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,519
So this is an elementary-level lesson.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,359
That's right.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,739
We are going to shop for things online.

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:26,140
So before we get started with this dialogue, let's take a look at one word we have for you on vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,120
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,939
Okay, the word we're looking at today is eBay.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,119
Okay, so this is a proper noun, it's an actual website, eBay.com.

11
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:38,619
That's right.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,679
It's kind of like a store on the internet for people who want to buy used things.

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:54,359
Okay, so maybe if you have a TV that you don't want anymore, you go on eBay, you put pictures of it online, and you offer it and anyone can buy it.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:54,920
That's right.

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,340
So you can be a buyer, that means you buy things, or a seller, so you sell things.

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,479
So this is interesting.

17
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,920
Usually you find used things on eBay, but you can also find new things.

18
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:06,640
You can.

19
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,379
It's kind of like the Chinese website Taobao.

20
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,500
I've actually even seen people selling cars on eBay.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:14,819
Cars?

22
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:15,299
Yeah.

23
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,340
I can't imagine buying a car on the internet.

24
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,819
Really?

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,260
No, they have even very luxurious cars on eBay.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:32,340
So we'll talk more about online shopping a little bit later on, but now why don't we listen to our dialogue for the first time, and then we'll come back in just a little bit.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,540
What are you doing?

28
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,420
I'm just looking for a nice pillow on eBay.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,079
You're shopping for a pillow online?

30
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,379
That's absurd.

31
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,099
Why?

32
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,420
I don't have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I'm looking for.

33
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:00,079
This way, I just search for it online, quick and easy.

34
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:01,219
I see.

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,799
But how do you pay for it?

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,920
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:14,620
Well, the website handles a point system, where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively, and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,039
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

39
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:18,539
So how do you pay?

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,639
Do you need a credit card?

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,319
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

42
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,240
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

43
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:30,639
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

44
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,280
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,979
You can find anything.

46
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,780
Are you sure you want to start shopping online, though?

47
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,979
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

48
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,960
Let's do it!

49
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,280
All right, we're back.

50
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,840
So now we have four key words for you on language takeaway.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,039
Language takeaway.

52
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,219
The first word you might have already heard us use already, we're talking about going on the Internet to do something.

53
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,219
So we say, to go online.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,099
Okay.

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,639
So by saying that you are going online, you say that you are using the Internet.

56
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,500
That's right.

57
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,460
So you can shop for something online.

58
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,319
Online means the Internet, right?

59
00:03:20,419 --> 00:03:21,099
On the Internet.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,860
So we don't say in the Internet.

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,099
We say we're on the Internet.

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,699
For example, he's been on the Internet all day long.

63
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,240
I want to use the computer.

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,020
Okay, so I can say he's been online all day long.

65
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:34,580
That's right.

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,860
Okay, so that is online.

67
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:45,599
And when we go online and we are looking through different websites or maybe we are looking at items on eBay, we are browsing.

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,060
Okay, the verb here is to browse.

69
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,879
Now, to browse is to look at, but not carefully.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Just to look at with maybe the idea to shop or to buy later.

71
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,340
Okay, so you can use browse for online things, but you can also use it for physical things like you are in a shop, you are browsing.

72
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:03,900
That's right.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,780
So I can go to a clothing store and I can browse.

74
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,960
For example, if the woman at the clothing store says, would you like to buy something?

75
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,979
I say, no, I'm just browsing.

76
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:13,819
I'm just looking.

77
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,500
Okay, very good.

78
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,720
And then when they were talking about eBay and how it works, the person mentioned that they have a point system.

79
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:24,800
All right, a point system.

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,339
Now, this is something you hear about a lot on websites these days.

81
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,259
For example, many websites have different users.

82
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:37,459
And so how do I know which users or which, in this case, sellers are the best?

83
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,800
Well, we have a point system.

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
More points means better.

85
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,379
Fewer points means worse.

86
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:43,980
Right.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,680
You might also call this a star system.

88
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:55,600
So basically, a point system is a way to show who is a very good community member and who is not.

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,500
That's right.

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,699
And that takes us to our next word.

91
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,480
So if a person has a lot of points in their point system, that means they are trustworthy.

92
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,259
Okay, trustworthy is an adjective.

93
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,319
He is trustworthy.

94
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,420
They are trustworthy.

95
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:13,500
This means that I can trust them.

96
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:14,720
They are reliable.

97
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,360
That's right.

98
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,379
So I don't think they will lie to me.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,079
I don't think they will cheat me.

100
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:19,620
Okay.

101
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:22,100
So a person can be trustworthy.

102
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
A company can be trustworthy.

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,579
Right.

104
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,579
Or you could say, he never pays me back.

105
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,600
He's not very trustworthy when I lend him money.

106
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,500
Okay, very good.

107
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,980
So four key words there.

108
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,180
Why don't we listen to them again in our dialogue, and we'll be back shortly.

109
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,980
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively.

110
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,740
And then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

111
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,120
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

112
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,620
So how do you pay?

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,740
Do you need a credit card?

114
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,399
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

115
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:26,319
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

116
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,759
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

117
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,439
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

118
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,079
You can find anything.

119
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,899
Are you sure you want to start shopping online though?

120
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

121
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:43,580
Let's do it.

122
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,579
All right, we're back.

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,439
So now we have three key phrases that we saw in our dialogue.

124
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,180
And let's take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

125
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,259
Fluency Builder.

126
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,399
Well, the first phrase we have here is related to that last word we had, trustworthy.

127
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,600
Someone is not trustworthy if they will rip you off.

128
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:13,279
Okay, so it's a phrasal verb, to rip you off or to rip off.

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
To rip someone off.

130
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,360
That's right.

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,819
So they ripped him off.

132
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,579
He ripped her off.

133
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:25,699
This means to steal money from someone or to cheat someone.

134
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:37,639
So maybe if a pair of shoes usually in a store costs $50 and then your friend sells them to you for $200, your friend ripped you off.

135
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,579
That's right.

136
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,800
He ripped you off.

137
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,060
That's not a good friend.

138
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,399
He's not very trustworthy.

139
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,139
All right.

140
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:54,560
So now when they were talking about how safe it is to make purchases online, the person explained that it's pretty safe and that no one has ever hacked his information.

141
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,420
Okay, so this is an important verb that has to do with the Internet.

142
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,139
To hack information is to steal information on the Internet.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,540
So someone who hacks, who steals this information is called a hacker.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,199
Okay, and this is something that's very bad.

145
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:19,540
We want to go to secure and safe websites because we don't want people to hack our personal information.

146
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,360
That's right.

147
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,779
Okay, so the verb is to hack.

148
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,800
And finally, in the end, when they were going to look for a sweater for a dog, the person said, you know what, this is great.

149
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:32,559
Are you sure you want to start to shop online?

150
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,860
Once you do this, there is no turning back.

151
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,259
Oh, I love this phrase.

152
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,659
There's no turning back.

153
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,039
So this is, well, you think about someone who's leaving.

154
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,480
You say there's no turning back.

155
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,639
You can't go back.

156
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,639
You can't return to where you were.

157
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,039
Right.

158
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,039
This is something we say as a warning.

159
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,179
So listen, this is your final decision.

160
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,960
If you say yes, you cannot change your mind.

161
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,480
You cannot say no later.

162
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,879
So you can't turn back later.

163
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:00,500
That's right.

164
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,500
So there's no turning back now.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,279
Okay, no turning back.

166
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,220
Very good.

167
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,980
Interesting phrases, key words, and everything.

168
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,460
So we should listen to this dialogue one last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

169
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,620
This way, I just search for it online, quick and easy.

170
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,779
I see.

171
00:09:43,179 --> 00:09:44,360
But how do you pay for it?

172
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,460
How do you know you aren't going to be ripped off by the seller?

173
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:56,179
Well, the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong, people comment negatively, and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy.

174
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,580
Wow, that sounds pretty safe.

175
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,080
So how do you pay?

176
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
Do you need a credit card?

177
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,840
You can use a credit card or your debit card.

178
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,799
They also let you use the PayPal system, which is really safe and fast.

179
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:12,240
I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything.

180
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,840
Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online?

181
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,539
You can find anything.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,340
Are you sure you want to start shopping online, though?

183
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,519
Once you step into this world, there is no turning back.

184
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:25,539
Let's do it.

185
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,559
Online Shopping All right, so now we're talking about online shopping.

186
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,200
Have you ever bought anything online, used your credit card online?

187
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,059
I have.

188
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:50,179
I've used my credit card on Amazon.com to purchase books on the Internet, but I know that you are much more of a fan of online shopping.

189
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:53,259
You use the Chinese website Taobao all the time.

190
00:10:53,259 --> 00:11:06,220
Yeah, well actually I wrote this dialogue and it's kind of based on something real because sometimes going to the stores, it can be great and you can see things and physically touch them, but I'm a little bit more practical.

191
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,720
I know exactly what I want or maybe I saw it.

192
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:16,720
So I don't want to have to go to the stores and deal with haggling or negotiating or sometimes it's even more expensive.

193
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:24,539
So from the comfort of my own home, just put in my debit card number and buy things online and I get it delivered overnight.

194
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,399
Well, and you never go shopping now.

195
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,879
Well, shopping you have to go to the clothing store for clothes, the video game store for video games, and on the Internet it's all in one place.

196
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,460
You're at home, you're in your pajamas, you use your credit card.

197
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:49,480
And the cool thing is that you can even, sometimes you want to buy small things, like in this case maybe a pillow or you want to buy, like recently I bought some candles, some decorative candles.

198
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,840
So, I don't know, do you really want to go out downtown, look for the candle shop where you can get them?

199
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,080
You can just do it online.

200
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,080
Do it online.

201
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,779
Let us know, do you shop on the Internet?

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,440
If you do, what kind of services do you use?

203
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,779
What stores do you go to?

204
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,700
Let us know.

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,759
