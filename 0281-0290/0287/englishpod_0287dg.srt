00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com I hate coming to high school reunions.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It'll be great, honey.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, I guess so.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, look.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
There's Robert Matthews.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Rob!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hey, Bill.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wow.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Great to see you.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Likewise.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's been a long time.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is my wife, Dorothy.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Pleasure to meet you.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, Bill, how have you been?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Can't complain.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How about you?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ah, you know me.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You remember her.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We were high school sweethearts.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's good.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Have you seen Frank?

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was hoping he would come tonight.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You didn't hear?

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Frank passed away last year.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are you serious?

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He'll be here soon.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I saw him last week.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He told me he would show up.
