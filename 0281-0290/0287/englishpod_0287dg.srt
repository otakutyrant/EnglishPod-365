00:00:01,739 --> 00:00:08,099
EnglishPod.com I hate coming to high school reunions.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,679
It'll be great, honey.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,560
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,660
Yeah, I guess so.

5
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:17,579
Oh, look.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,059
There's Robert Matthews.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,019
Rob!

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,379
Hey, Bill.

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:21,899
Wow.

10
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,219
Great to see you.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:23,839
Likewise.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,019
It's been a long time.

13
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,500
This is my wife, Dorothy.

14
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:28,160
Pleasure to meet you.

15
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,760
So, Bill, how have you been?

16
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:30,879
Can't complain.

17
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,740
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

18
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:35,880
How about you?

19
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,520
Ah, you know me.

20
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,119
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

21
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,759
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

22
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:43,799
You remember her.

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,460
We were high school sweethearts.

24
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:49,100
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

25
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,359
That's good.

26
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,520
Have you seen Frank?

27
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,280
I was hoping he would come tonight.

28
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,460
You didn't hear?

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,899
Frank passed away last year.

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,140
Are you serious?

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,119
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

32
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,079
He'll be here soon.

33
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,060
I saw him last week.

34
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,359
He told me he would show up.
