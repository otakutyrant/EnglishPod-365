00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:04,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:09,740
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary-level lesson in which we're going to talk about small talk.

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:10,859
That's right.

5
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:20,199
Today we're going to talk to an old friend, and so we're going to give you some of the words and phrases you need to talk about your past or talk about how you have been.

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,399
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss it.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,620
I hate coming to high school reunions.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,200
It'll be great, honey.

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,060
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,179
Yeah, I guess so.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,079
Oh, look.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,560
There's Robert Matthews.

13
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:43,500
Rob!

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,880
Hey, Bill.

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,380
Wow.

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,719
Great to see you.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,340
Likewise.

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,539
It's been a long time.

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,000
This is my wife, Dorothy.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,600
Pleasure to meet you.

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,240
So Bill, how have you been?

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,359
Can't complain.

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,240
We have two children who are in college, and my business is going well.

24
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,380
How about you?

25
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,020
You know me.

26
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

27
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,260
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

28
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:07,280
You remember her.

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,980
We were high school sweethearts.

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,640
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,859
That's good.

32
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,019
Have you seen Frank?

33
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,780
I was hoping he would come tonight.

34
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:17,980
You didn't hear?

35
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,359
Frank passed away last year.

36
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,640
Are you serious?

37
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,620
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,579
He'll be here soon.

39
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:25,579
I saw him last week.

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,000
He told me he would show up.

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,819
All right, we're back, so now let's get started with our language takeaway.

42
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,159
Language takeaway.

43
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:45,159
The first phrase we have here in language takeaway is a very important one because it is the setting for today's dialogue.

44
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,439
We are at a high school reunion.

45
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:48,200
That's right.

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:02:02,659
Everyone knows what high school is, but a high school reunion is when you go back to your high school for a party maybe five years or ten years after you graduate, so then you meet all your old friends from high school.

47
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:08,539
You talk about how you have been and just meet up with everyone that maybe you haven't seen in a very long time.

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,319
Exactly.

49
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,699
A reunion usually happens every five years, ten years, or twenty years.

50
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:23,319
It can happen at different times, but this is important because you can have many different kinds of reunions, like a college reunion or a high school reunion.

51
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,180
I've even heard of some people who had an elementary school reunion.

52
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:27,560
Really?

53
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,060
Wow.

54
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,340
Imagine seeing your classmates when you were maybe ten years old.

55
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
I couldn't imagine it.

56
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:42,740
All right, so we're at a high school reunion, and we are there because we're going to meet our old classmates to catch up and see how they have been.

57
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,500
Okay, so this is exactly what you do at a reunion.

58
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:48,979
You catch up with people that you maybe lost touch with.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,580
To catch up means to find out about what people have been doing since the last time you talked.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,819
So maybe Marco and I were classmates in high school, and we haven't talked in ten years.

61
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,979
I say, Marco, I want to catch up.

62
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:07,240
I want to learn about what you do, who you married, where you work, things like that.

63
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,840
Right, so when two people get together to catch up, maybe it doesn't even have to be a very long time.

64
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:23,159
Maybe you haven't seen your friend for a week, and so you want to get together, have a cup of coffee, and catch up and see how the relationship has been going or how it works, so you want to catch up.

65
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:28,080
So you can say this in a very simple way, let's catch up, or it's been nice to catch up.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,960
That's right.

67
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,939
All right, moving on to our next word.

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,020
This guy, Bill, meets up with Robert Matthews, and they're saying, hey, wow, great to see you.

69
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,000
And he answers by saying, likewise.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,000
So, it's good to see you, likewise.

71
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:43,639
Right.

72
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,280
That means, it's good to see you, too.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,719
Mm-hmm, so you don't have to repeat everything that person just said.

74
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,439
For example, if I just meet someone new, and I say, it's a pleasure to meet you, you can say?

75
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:56,960
I could say, likewise.

76
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,780
Likewise.

77
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:00,919
Because I don't want to say, it's a pleasure to meet you, too.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,039
That's so many words.

79
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,699
So, likewise is a very short way to say all of those things.

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,620
That's right.

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,860
So, we were finding out about Robert Matthews, and he says that, well, he is a dedicated bachelor.

82
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,160
So, a dedicated bachelor, what is a bachelor, Marco?

83
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,500
So, a bachelor is a person who is not married, a person who is single.

84
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,220
A man.

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,959
A man.

86
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,519
A woman cannot be a bachelor.

87
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,939
So, a bachelor is specifically a man, and he's not married.

88
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,180
And we often have a stereotype, that means we have an idea of what a bachelor lives like.

89
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:42,860
You know, he has only beer in his refrigerator, and he has many relationships, and no wife, so.

90
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:43,439
That's right.

91
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:51,540
So, a dedicated bachelor is a person who is not married, and doesn't really seem to want to get married, or any of this.

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,100
He wants to stay single.

93
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,759
Exactly.

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,560
Okay.

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:03,540
And, well, to finish off, this guy Robert lied a little bit to Bill, saying that Frank had passed away.

96
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,019
That's really mean, but this phrase, to pass away, is very important and something we should talk about.

97
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,439
So, what does it mean, to pass away?

98
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,800
It's another way of saying, he died.

99
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:15,879
But it's nicer.

100
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,540
Yeah, it's a lot more subtle and nicer.

101
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,259
So, instead of saying, Frank died, you say, Frank passed away.

102
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,060
So, you could say, you know, last year, my grandmother passed away.

103
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,560
That's a way of saying that my grandmother died last year.

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,139
But, again, it's a lot nicer way to say that.

105
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,560
Because the word died can be a little bit too direct and too harsh.

106
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,240
So, maybe saying, my grandmother passed away last year, it's a nicer way of saying it.

107
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,300
Okay, so that's all the language takeaway you have.

108
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,680
Let's take a look at our dialogue again, and we'll be back.

109
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,240
I hate coming to high school reunions.

110
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,800
It'll be great, honey.

111
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,660
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,939
Ah, yeah, I guess so.

113
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,199
Oh, look, there's Robert Matthews.

114
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,139
Rob!

115
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:07,519
Hey, Bill.

116
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,399
Wow, great to see you.

117
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,180
Likewise, it's been a long time.

118
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,639
This is my wife, Dorothy.

119
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,279
Pleasure to meet you.

120
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,899
So, Bill, how have you been?

121
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,040
Can't complain.

122
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,879
We have two children who are in college, and my business is going well.

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,000
How about you?

124
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:23,680
Ah, you know me.

125
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,279
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

126
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,899
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

127
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,939
You remember her.

128
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,600
We were high school sweethearts.

129
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,300
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

130
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,500
That's good.

131
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,660
Have you seen Frank?

132
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,399
I was hoping he would come tonight.

133
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,600
You didn't hear?

134
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,000
Frank passed away last year.

135
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,279
Are you serious?

136
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,259
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

137
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,220
He'll be here soon.

138
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,199
I saw him last week.

139
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,600
He told me he would show up.

140
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,060
Alright, let's move on now to four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,519
So the focus of today's Fluency Builder is small talk.

142
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,560
These are phrases you can use when you're at a reunion or dinner, especially with people you don't know very well.

143
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:14,740
So let's jump in and look at this first phrase, great to see you.

144
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:15,639
That's right.

145
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,980
So he says, hey, Bill, wow, great to see you.

146
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,079
So this is a nice little opening phrase saying, wow, I'm really excited to see you.

147
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,379
I'm really happy to see you.

148
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,040
Exactly.

149
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:27,019
It means I'm happy.

150
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,839
Look at you.

151
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,180
You know, great to see you.

152
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,100
You say this at the beginning of a conversation.

153
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:32,800
That's right.

154
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,180
And actually, Bill responded by saying, likewise.

155
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:37,560
So we talked about this.

156
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,540
He's saying, wow, great to see you too.

157
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,660
Then he continues by saying, it's been a long time.

158
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,360
This means that these two people, they have not seen each other in a very long time.

159
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,319
You can also say, it's been so long or it's been a long time.

160
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:58,339
That means it's been a long time since we last saw each other.

161
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,040
That's right.

162
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,319
So Robert goes on to ask Bill.

163
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,540
He says, well, you know, how have you been?

164
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:04,959
How are things?

165
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,560
Bill answers by saying, can't complain.

166
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,980
OK, so this is not grammatically correct.

167
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,339
Normally you need a subject, right?

168
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,639
I can't complain.

169
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,879
But when we're speaking in English and we're having a conversation like this, it's OK to say just can't complain as a phrase.

170
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,100
So he's saying, how have you been?

171
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,040
Well, I can't complain.

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Can't complain.

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,759
That means nothing bad has happened.

174
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,940
Things are OK.

175
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:33,879
Right.

176
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,159
You're saying that things are good.

177
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,259
They're not fantastic, but they're not bad either.

178
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:39,860
So you can't really complain.

179
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,259
So it's just a phrase where very directly you can say, oh, can't complain.

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,000
Everything's great.

181
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:53,620
So you could even say this about about other things like, you know, I asked I asked John how his job was and he said, can't complain.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,120
Right.

183
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,840
I mean, it's not great, but it's not bad.

184
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,320
Right.

185
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,320
Exactly right.

186
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:58,320
All right.

187
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:08,220
And obviously we saw how Robert lied to Bill by saying that their good friend, that their good friend Frank had passed away.

188
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,879
And he said, are you serious?

189
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,600
No, I'm just yanking your chain.

190
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:23,980
OK, so this might sound very strange to to a lot of you because a chain is something that that doesn't really seem to fit in this conversation.

191
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:24,360
Right.

192
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:25,899
But yanking your chain.

193
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,179
Remember this as a phrase.

194
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,600
It means I'm just joking.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,100
Right.

196
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,039
I'm just kidding.

197
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,940
I'm lying to you, I guess.

198
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,279
Right.

199
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,659
So but how can you use this in another context?

200
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,740
OK, I could say, you know what, Marco, I have something I have to tell you.

201
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,519
And I say what?

202
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm leaving EnglishPod.

203
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,500
I quit.

204
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,340
Are you serious?

205
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,139
No, I'm just yanking your chain.

206
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:47,779
OK.

207
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,759
Or no, I'm just kidding.

208
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,240
Right.

209
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,379
So you're kind of teasing someone when you do this, right?

210
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,779
I'm just yanking your chain.

211
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,179
I'm just lying to you.

212
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,080
I'm teasing you.

213
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,360
I'm I'm making you believe something that isn't that isn't true.

214
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,039
Exactly.

215
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,799
So this is this is something you can use after you tell someone that you were just joking.

216
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,899
So, you know, I'm just yanking your chain.

217
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,360
I'm just joking with you.

218
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,980
That's right.

219
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,600
So don't try to translate it directly or literally because it's not going to make sense.

220
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,259
So just remember this as a phrasal verb or a phrase in general.

221
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:19,779
Exactly.

222
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,340
All right.

223
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,700
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

224
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,080
I hate coming to high school reunions.

225
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,639
It'll be great, honey.

226
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,600
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

227
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,620
Yeah, I guess so.

228
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:42,059
Oh, look, there's Robert Matthews.

229
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,019
Rob.

230
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,360
Hey, Bill.

231
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,879
Wow.

232
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
Great to see you.

233
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:46,820
Likewise.

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
It's been a long time.

235
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,500
This is my wife, Dorothy.

236
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,120
Pleasure to meet you.

237
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,740
So, Bill, how have you been?

238
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,860
Can't complain.

239
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,720
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

240
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,860
How about you?

241
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,519
You know me.

242
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,139
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

243
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,740
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

244
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:06,779
You remember her.

245
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,440
We were high school sweethearts.

246
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,100
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

247
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:13,340
That's good.

248
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,519
Have you seen Frank?

249
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,240
I was hoping he would come tonight.

250
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:17,460
You didn't hear?

251
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,840
Frank passed away last year.

252
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,120
Are you serious?

253
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,100
Nah, I'm just yanking your chain.

254
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,080
He'll be here soon.

255
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,039
I saw him last week.

256
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
He told me he would show up.

257
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,299
Alright, so we're back and talking about high school reunions.

258
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,039
These are very popular in the United States, right?

259
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,480
They are very popular and I think people often have them every 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

260
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,580
But most people don't go to the high school reunion until either 10 or 20 years after their high school graduation.

261
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:47,720
Why is that?

262
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,419
I think 5 years is very soon.

263
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:59,759
10 years is nice because you haven't seen people, but 20 years is really, I think, shocking because people can be completely different or they could be the same.

264
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,200
But it's been, you know, you were 18 when you graduated high school.

265
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,240
Now you're 38 years old.

266
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,940
You have this whole life that you've had and so I think it's much more interesting.

267
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:18,799
Yeah, it's very interesting and I guess people go to these things half because they do want to maybe meet up with old friends that they haven't kept in touch with.

268
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,080
I think especially this was very popular before the whole Internet revolution.

269
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,679
Now everyone's in touch on Facebook and emails and it's just so much easier to keep in touch.

270
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:35,019
But before you have to remember that, you know, it was basically by telephone or by mail.

271
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,500
So actually seeing a person 10 years or catching up with them was very difficult back then.

272
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:50,200
Yeah, we all see photos and videos now of our classmates, so it's not quite as surprising when we bump into them later.

273
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:58,000
But I think it is still interesting, though, because at least on my social networking websites, there are a lot of people that I don't have connections to.

274
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:06,519
And so I look forward to my high school reunion when I get to see some of these people and kind of find out what they've been doing for the past 10 or 15 years.

275
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:23,860
It's actually very interesting, I guess, when you see how your classmates have changed, how maybe the one that used to be the nerd or maybe not very attractive all of a sudden is really attractive and has like a supermodel as a wife or how these things work out.

276
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,379
Or the high school football captain is now kind of sad and, you know, fat.

277
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,440
So, yeah, these are the types of surprises that people look forward to when they go to high school reunions.

278
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,519
So a very interesting subject.

279
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:46,460
Let us know on our website EnglishPod.com if your high school and the place where you live, do they have high school reunions or maybe even elementary school reunions?

280
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,419
Yeah, let us know.

281
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,240
We hope to find out more about you guys' experiences.

282
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,860
And until next time, bye.
