00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary-level lesson in which we're going to talk about small talk.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today we're going to talk to an old friend, and so we're going to give you some of the words and phrases you need to talk about your past or talk about how you have been.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to discuss it.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I hate coming to high school reunions.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It'll be great, honey.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, I guess so.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, look.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There's Robert Matthews.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Rob!

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, Bill.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Wow.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Great to see you.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Likewise.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's been a long time.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is my wife, Dorothy.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Pleasure to meet you.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So Bill, how have you been?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Can't complain.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We have two children who are in college, and my business is going well.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How about you?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You know me.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You remember her.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We were high school sweethearts.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's good.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Have you seen Frank?

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was hoping he would come tonight.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You didn't hear?

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Frank passed away last year.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Are you serious?

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He'll be here soon.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I saw him last week.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He told me he would show up.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
All right, we're back, so now let's get started with our language takeaway.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Language takeaway.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The first phrase we have here in language takeaway is a very important one because it is the setting for today's dialogue.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We are at a high school reunion.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's right.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Everyone knows what high school is, but a high school reunion is when you go back to your high school for a party maybe five years or ten years after you graduate, so then you meet all your old friends from high school.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You talk about how you have been and just meet up with everyone that maybe you haven't seen in a very long time.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Exactly.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A reunion usually happens every five years, ten years, or twenty years.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It can happen at different times, but this is important because you can have many different kinds of reunions, like a college reunion or a high school reunion.

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've even heard of some people who had an elementary school reunion.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Really?

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wow.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Imagine seeing your classmates when you were maybe ten years old.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I couldn't imagine it.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All right, so we're at a high school reunion, and we are there because we're going to meet our old classmates to catch up and see how they have been.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, so this is exactly what you do at a reunion.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You catch up with people that you maybe lost touch with.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To catch up means to find out about what people have been doing since the last time you talked.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So maybe Marco and I were classmates in high school, and we haven't talked in ten years.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I say, Marco, I want to catch up.

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to learn about what you do, who you married, where you work, things like that.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right, so when two people get together to catch up, maybe it doesn't even have to be a very long time.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe you haven't seen your friend for a week, and so you want to get together, have a cup of coffee, and catch up and see how the relationship has been going or how it works, so you want to catch up.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So you can say this in a very simple way, let's catch up, or it's been nice to catch up.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's right.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right, moving on to our next word.

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This guy, Bill, meets up with Robert Matthews, and they're saying, hey, wow, great to see you.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And he answers by saying, likewise.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, it's good to see you, likewise.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That means, it's good to see you, too.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mm-hmm, so you don't have to repeat everything that person just said.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
For example, if I just meet someone new, and I say, it's a pleasure to meet you, you can say?

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I could say, likewise.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Likewise.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because I don't want to say, it's a pleasure to meet you, too.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's so many words.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So, likewise is a very short way to say all of those things.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, we were finding out about Robert Matthews, and he says that, well, he is a dedicated bachelor.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So, a dedicated bachelor, what is a bachelor, Marco?

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So, a bachelor is a person who is not married, a person who is single.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A man.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A man.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A woman cannot be a bachelor.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, a bachelor is specifically a man, and he's not married.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we often have a stereotype, that means we have an idea of what a bachelor lives like.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, he has only beer in his refrigerator, and he has many relationships, and no wife, so.

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, a dedicated bachelor is a person who is not married, and doesn't really seem to want to get married, or any of this.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He wants to stay single.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Exactly.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And, well, to finish off, this guy Robert lied a little bit to Bill, saying that Frank had passed away.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's really mean, but this phrase, to pass away, is very important and something we should talk about.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So, what does it mean, to pass away?

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's another way of saying, he died.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it's nicer.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah, it's a lot more subtle and nicer.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, instead of saying, Frank died, you say, Frank passed away.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So, you could say, you know, last year, my grandmother passed away.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's a way of saying that my grandmother died last year.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But, again, it's a lot nicer way to say that.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Because the word died can be a little bit too direct and too harsh.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, maybe saying, my grandmother passed away last year, it's a nicer way of saying it.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so that's all the language takeaway you have.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's take a look at our dialogue again, and we'll be back.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I hate coming to high school reunions.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It'll be great, honey.

111
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ah, yeah, I guess so.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, look, there's Robert Matthews.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Rob!

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, Bill.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow, great to see you.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Likewise, it's been a long time.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is my wife, Dorothy.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Pleasure to meet you.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, Bill, how have you been?

121
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Can't complain.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We have two children who are in college, and my business is going well.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How about you?

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ah, you know me.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You remember her.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
We were high school sweethearts.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's good.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Have you seen Frank?

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was hoping he would come tonight.

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You didn't hear?

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Frank passed away last year.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Are you serious?

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Nah, I'm just janking your chain.

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He'll be here soon.

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I saw him last week.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He told me he would show up.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Alright, let's move on now to four key phrases on Fluency Builder.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So the focus of today's Fluency Builder is small talk.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
These are phrases you can use when you're at a reunion or dinner, especially with people you don't know very well.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So let's jump in and look at this first phrase, great to see you.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So he says, hey, Bill, wow, great to see you.

146
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So this is a nice little opening phrase saying, wow, I'm really excited to see you.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm really happy to see you.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Exactly.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It means I'm happy.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look at you.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You know, great to see you.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You say this at the beginning of a conversation.

153
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's right.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And actually, Bill responded by saying, likewise.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So we talked about this.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He's saying, wow, great to see you too.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then he continues by saying, it's been a long time.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This means that these two people, they have not seen each other in a very long time.

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can also say, it's been so long or it's been a long time.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That means it's been a long time since we last saw each other.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So Robert goes on to ask Bill.

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He says, well, you know, how have you been?

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How are things?

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Bill answers by saying, can't complain.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
OK, so this is not grammatically correct.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Normally you need a subject, right?

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can't complain.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But when we're speaking in English and we're having a conversation like this, it's OK to say just can't complain as a phrase.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So he's saying, how have you been?

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, I can't complain.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Can't complain.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That means nothing bad has happened.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Things are OK.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right.

176
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're saying that things are good.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They're not fantastic, but they're not bad either.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So you can't really complain.

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So it's just a phrase where very directly you can say, oh, can't complain.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Everything's great.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So you could even say this about about other things like, you know, I asked I asked John how his job was and he said, can't complain.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Right.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I mean, it's not great, but it's not bad.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Right.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Exactly right.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
All right.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And obviously we saw how Robert lied to Bill by saying that their good friend, that their good friend Frank had passed away.

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And he said, are you serious?

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, I'm just yanking your chain.

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
OK, so this might sound very strange to to a lot of you because a chain is something that that doesn't really seem to fit in this conversation.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Right.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But yanking your chain.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Remember this as a phrase.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It means I'm just joking.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right.

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm just kidding.

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm lying to you, I guess.

198
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So but how can you use this in another context?

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
OK, I could say, you know what, Marco, I have something I have to tell you.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And I say what?

202
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm leaving EnglishPod.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I quit.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Are you serious?

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, I'm just yanking your chain.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
OK.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Or no, I'm just kidding.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So you're kind of teasing someone when you do this, right?

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm just yanking your chain.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm just lying to you.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm teasing you.

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm I'm making you believe something that isn't that isn't true.

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Exactly.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So this is this is something you can use after you tell someone that you were just joking.

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So, you know, I'm just yanking your chain.

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm just joking with you.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So don't try to translate it directly or literally because it's not going to make sense.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So just remember this as a phrasal verb or a phrase in general.

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Exactly.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
All right.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's listen to our dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I hate coming to high school reunions.

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It'll be great, honey.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they've been doing.

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, I guess so.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, look, there's Robert Matthews.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Rob.

230
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Hey, Bill.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wow.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Great to see you.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Likewise.

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's been a long time.

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This is my wife, Dorothy.

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Pleasure to meet you.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, Bill, how have you been?

238
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Can't complain.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We have two children who are in college and my business is going well.

240
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How about you?

241
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You know me.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm a dedicated bachelor.

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I never married, although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You remember her.

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We were high school sweethearts.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It didn't really work out between us, but I really can't complain either.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's good.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Have you seen Frank?

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was hoping he would come tonight.

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You didn't hear?

251
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Frank passed away last year.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you serious?

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Nah, I'm just yanking your chain.

254
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He'll be here soon.

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I saw him last week.

256
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He told me he would show up.

257
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Alright, so we're back and talking about high school reunions.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
These are very popular in the United States, right?

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They are very popular and I think people often have them every 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But most people don't go to the high school reunion until either 10 or 20 years after their high school graduation.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why is that?

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think 5 years is very soon.

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
10 years is nice because you haven't seen people, but 20 years is really, I think, shocking because people can be completely different or they could be the same.

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But it's been, you know, you were 18 when you graduated high school.

265
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Now you're 38 years old.

266
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You have this whole life that you've had and so I think it's much more interesting.

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah, it's very interesting and I guess people go to these things half because they do want to maybe meet up with old friends that they haven't kept in touch with.

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think especially this was very popular before the whole Internet revolution.

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Now everyone's in touch on Facebook and emails and it's just so much easier to keep in touch.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But before you have to remember that, you know, it was basically by telephone or by mail.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So actually seeing a person 10 years or catching up with them was very difficult back then.

272
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, we all see photos and videos now of our classmates, so it's not quite as surprising when we bump into them later.

273
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But I think it is still interesting, though, because at least on my social networking websites, there are a lot of people that I don't have connections to.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And so I look forward to my high school reunion when I get to see some of these people and kind of find out what they've been doing for the past 10 or 15 years.

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's actually very interesting, I guess, when you see how your classmates have changed, how maybe the one that used to be the nerd or maybe not very attractive all of a sudden is really attractive and has like a supermodel as a wife or how these things work out.

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Or the high school football captain is now kind of sad and, you know, fat.

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So, yeah, these are the types of surprises that people look forward to when they go to high school reunions.

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So a very interesting subject.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Let us know on our website EnglishPod.com if your high school and the place where you live, do they have high school reunions or maybe even elementary school reunions?

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, let us know.

281
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We hope to find out more about you guys' experiences.

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And until next time, bye.
