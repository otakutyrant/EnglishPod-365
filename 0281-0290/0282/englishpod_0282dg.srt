EnglishPod.com Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,099
Welcome to Physics 101.

3
00:00:13,779 --> 00:00:16,760
My name is Ed Brown and I will be a professor for the semester.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,980
Since today is our first day, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this semester.

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,879
Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics, professor?

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,380
This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a broad overview of the field of physics.

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:47,420
The term physics encompasses many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will provide you with a conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove useful whether or not you choose to further your study in the field.

8
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:55,899
We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental concepts of physics, then by the middle of the semester, we will begin exploring the more theoretical side of physics.

9
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:03,479
It is essential that you first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them.

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,000
Will we learn about black holes, wormholes, and string theory?

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,319
We will learn about the general theory of relativity, including black holes.

12
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,180
We will also explore the developing theories in quantum mechanics, such as string theory.

13
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,480
We will discuss some hypothetical features of space-time, like wormholes.

14
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:31,079
We will also explore some of the more influential developments in the field of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern life.

15
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,040
Now I'm going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this class, so you can see how this course will be graded.

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,620
Oh man, looks like this isn't going to be the easy A I thought it'd be.
