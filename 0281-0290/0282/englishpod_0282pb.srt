00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,459
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:04,139
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,519
My name is Catherine, and today we have an advanced level lesson for you.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,679
This one's a bit difficult.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,160
It's all about science.

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,160
That's right.

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:23,519
Today we're going to talk about physics, specifically about, well, you know, things like Stephen Hawking and wormholes, black holes, and general theory of relativity and all that good stuff.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,100
Right.

9
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,320
So we're in class.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,019
We're learning about physics today, and you're going to hear a lot of terms.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,339
Don't worry if you're not really sure what they mean.

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,640
We'll be back in a moment to talk about them.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,500
Good morning, everybody.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,960
Welcome to Physics 101.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,600
My name is Ed Brown, and I will be your professor for the semester.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,840
Since today is our first day, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this semester.

17
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,700
Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics, professor?

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,239
This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a broad overview of the field of physics.

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:20,260
The term physics encompasses many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will provide you with a conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove useful whether or not you choose to further your study in the field.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,219
We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental concepts of physics.

21
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,760
Then by the middle of the semester, we will begin exploring the more theoretical side of physics.

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:36,319
It is essential that you first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them.

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,859
Will we learn about black holes, worm holes, and string theory?

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,159
We will learn about the general theory of relativity, including black holes.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,040
We will also explore the developing theories in quantum mechanics, such as string theory.

26
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:54,319
We will discuss some hypothetical features of space-time, like worm holes.

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,920
We will also explore some of the more influential developments in the field of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern life.

28
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:09,939
Now I'm going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this class, so you can see how this course will be graded.

29
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,800
Oh man, looks like this isn't going to be the easy A I thought it'd be.

30
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,300
All right, we're back.

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,840
So obviously we are in a class, as you said, and the professor is pretty much introducing the course and what's going to happen during the semester.

32
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:27,400
That's right.

33
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:32,819
So he's talking about the different kinds of physics, or the different elements of physics, that will be a part of this course.

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,419
And there's a very eager student, he's very excited, and he wants to know, are these interesting things going to be a part of the course?

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:49,560
And so when we started out, we talked about these two different fields of physics, and I think maybe it would be helpful to start there with these two branches of this field.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,259
That's right, he mentioned this boy Matt said if they're going to be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics.

37
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:03,060
Now theoretical physics and experimental physics are what we call two different branches of physics.

38
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,319
That means they're both physics.

39
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,039
But people who do them have different methods and maybe focus on different things.

40
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,159
Theoretical comes from the word theory.

41
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:22,060
So I have a theory about something, and I'm going to think about whether or not it's possible, and maybe there's some math involved.

42
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,000
But with experimental physics, the key word here is experiment.

43
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,800
That means we actually build experiments to test our theories.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,740
That's right.

45
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:40,479
So I guess theoretical physics, we can just have theories about how things happen or explain them, but we can't really prove them.

46
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,939
We can just have theories around them.

47
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,300
Maybe we can try and prove them mathematically.

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,539
But experimental physics, you can actually, as you said, create an experiment to prove it or not.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,340
That's right.

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,900
And so those are the two main branches that the young man asks about.

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,219
But the professor says, you know, listen, we're going to be talking about the fundamental concepts of physics.

52
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:05,919
And so fundamental concepts are things that you often hear a professor talk about in your introductory class.

53
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,259
So introduction to mathematics or introduction to physics.

54
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,840
So fundamental concepts are the basics.

55
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:11,840
That's right.

56
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:15,759
So the most important, but also the ones at the very bottom, the foundation.

57
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,839
Because you can learn about more difficult or more complicated things later.

58
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:21,779
But first you have to have a foundation.

59
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,620
So those are the fundamental concepts.

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,180
Right.

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:34,959
And actually after the professor said that, this guy Matt went on to ask if they were going to learn about black holes, wormholes and string theory.

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:35,779
Okay.

63
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,240
So three very important parts of physics, but very, very complicated things.

64
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,120
The first two are related, right?

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,639
So we've got astrophysics.

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,100
Astro means star.

67
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:51,459
So astrophysics is the physics of things, bodies in space, planets, stars, things like that.

68
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:51,879
That's right.

69
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:57,160
And so two concepts that we often talk about in astrophysics are black holes and wormholes.

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,399
So I think many of you have already heard this word black hole.

72
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,959
The concept of it is basically a huge hole in space that just sucks up everything.

73
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,040
The gravitational force.

74
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,079
So the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing can resist it.

75
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,199
Everything that comes close to a black hole, it's like in a drain.

76
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,519
Everything that comes close to it gets sucked into it.

77
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:19,959
No light can escape it.

78
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,720
That's right.

79
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,540
And the other concept there is a wormhole.

80
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:33,120
So it's basically a sort of bending of space and time in which you can travel from one point to another a lot faster than going in a straight line.

81
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,540
Or from one time to another.

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
So this is a very, very popular concept in science fiction movies and books.

83
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,800
For example, Star Trek, the most recent movie, the new movie Star Trek, there was a wormhole.

84
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,879
So one ship goes from the future and it comes into the past.

85
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,360
That's right.

86
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,060
So it has to travel through this wormhole.

87
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,819
That's right.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:02,300
So, and actually, yeah, you say science fiction and obviously it's hard to prove it, but this is one of the concepts that physicists think they can prove someday.

89
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:02,939
Someday.

90
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,879
And this is why it's a part of theoretical physics.

91
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,540
That's right.

92
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,480
And what about this other concept, string theory?

93
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,720
Okay, string theory is a theory about the way the world works, basically.

94
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:21,019
And it is a theory that actually competes with Einstein's view of the way the world works, right?

95
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,959
And string theory is about basically strings that are vibrating and that's the way the entire universe is kind of built.

96
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:43,720
Yeah, so basically at the subatomic level, usually you're supposed to have an atom, but also supposedly these atoms are made up of strings that, depending on the frequency at which they vibrate, they could constitute different elements or different parts.

97
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,600
Different kinds of matter, right.

98
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,040
Exactly.

99
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:56,060
And so we're talking about the very, very, very, very, very, very, very smallest building blocks of the things in the world, atoms and even quarks and jewels and those things.

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Exactly.

101
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,480
So it's actually one of these new things that, well, people are talking about string theory.

102
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,279
It's kind of this new way of seeing the world and explaining the unexplainable because there are so many things still in the world that we can't explain.

103
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,680
And people argue about this because obviously if you can't prove it, it's hard to say what is right and what is wrong.

104
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:17,339
Exactly.

105
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,019
But actually one thing that was proven was Einstein's general theory of relativity.

106
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,779
So this is something we all learned back in high school or in college.

107
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,240
That's right.

108
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:34,079
So basically the general theory of relativity is this idea that space and time are not fixed.

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,139
They're relative to each other.

110
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:47,180
So an example my teacher used to use is that when you travel very, very, very fast, imagine going around a jet around the world counterclockwise, time slows down the faster you move.

111
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,839
OK, so that proves that that time and space are not fixed.

112
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:53,680
That's right.

113
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:15,180
Actually, this the general theory of relativity and specifically this aspect of speed and time was proven with the example that you give with two atomic clocks that you kept one on the ground, like, I don't know, in your house, and you put one in an airplane that was traveling faster than the speed of sound.

114
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:31,480
And so after maybe an hour, the plane would land and the clocks would have not the same time anymore, but they would be one the clock that was in the airplane traveling faster would be maybe half a second off or something very, very small.

115
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,039
But you would see that time moved slower because your speed is faster.

116
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:36,740
All right.

117
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,220
So that's the general theory.

118
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,419
That's a part of the general theory of relativity.

119
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,440
It's a very important theory in the history of the world, but also in the history of physics.

120
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:52,100
Another thing, though, that the professor mentioned that is very important in physics these days is quantum mechanics.

121
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:59,799
Yes, this is actually a very interesting field of physics, but very hard to understand.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,700
In my opinion, for me, it's very, very hard.

123
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,340
I find it very complex, too.

124
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,320
Well, mechanics are the way the way things work.

125
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:06,720
Right.

126
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,299
And so quantum is at the atomic and subatomic level.

127
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:10,580
Right.

128
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:20,279
And so you're talking about basically the building blocks of the things in the universe and the people who people who are studying this are working on this quantum mechanics.

129
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,080
They they don't like the Einsteinians.

130
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,480
They don't like the people who follow Einstein because these two theories, they don't actually go together very well.

131
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,659
You either have to believe one or you have to believe the other.

132
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:46,519
Well, the problem is that when you're talking about when you're talking at the macro level, the way things work and the way things move, like, for example, you and me, of course, there are formulas in there, everything that explains and that prove that things are the way they are.

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,220
But the problem is that in quantum mechanics, at some atomic level, it's so different.

134
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,320
Like, for example, electronics.

135
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:03,980
The reason why we're able to have microprocessors and electronics is because, for example, atoms can be in two places at the same time, which is impossible in our world.

136
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:07,299
It's like saying, you know, Catherine can be in two places at the exact same time.

137
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,059
And there's also this problem of observation that I've read about.

138
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,220
So there are some kinds of particles like electrons, for example.

139
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:21,179
That if you're observing them sometimes appear as waves, but if you're observing them sometimes appear to have mass.

140
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,360
Exactly like light.

141
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,019
Yeah.

142
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:33,139
So you're talking about these things that seem to have a whole different set of rules from the rules that we have here, walking around and eating food and going to work.

143
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:39,639
And so I think that's what's fascinating about physics, that, you know, you can break things down to the very smallest parts and they seem very different.

144
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,299
Or you can think about the stars and the moon and, you know, these planets and they have their own rules, too.

145
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:53,000
And so, you know, there's that's why physics is such a very I think it's it's it's frustrating, frustrating, and it's exciting at the same time.

146
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:53,879
That's right.

147
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:03,460
And actually, some of the other fields that the professor said they were going to explore are the fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism and even nuclear physics.

148
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,240
So very important branches, I think, of physics as well.

149
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,779
So when you're studying physics or science, you will definitely hear about the laws of thermodynamics.

150
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,740
Thermal means heat and dynamics means, you know, changing, changing state.

151
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,120
And electromagnetism, of course, is the combination of two words, electricity and magnetism.

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,100
You know, like magnets, you have the plus end and the minus end, right?

153
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,740
They attract or they repel.

154
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,980
And then finally, nuclear physics.

155
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:39,059
Nuclear physics is very important because it's again about the about atoms and breaking down atoms and finding out what their parts are.

156
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,080
So you might have heard about the Hadron Super Collider, right?

157
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,399
It's just like a big it's like a big racetrack for atoms.

158
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,519
And they basically spin these atoms around the racetrack going faster and faster.

159
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,299
And then they put objects in their way so that they break.

160
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:59,639
They crash, they crash, and they study what the what the pieces look like and what happens and how much energy is released.

161
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,259
It's all very interesting.

162
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:11,039
And it seems like things that are out of science fiction because it's not something mainstream that you hear about in the news very often or that sometimes we understand.

163
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:17,299
Like, obviously, we all hear about the gossip magazines and who's dating who and all this other type of news.

164
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,220
But very rarely do we really pay attention to this type of information or news because it is a little bit complex to understand.

165
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,799
And it seems that I think scientists are not the best writers for average people like you and me.

166
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,639
They write in their own language almost.

167
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,740
Oftentimes, that's the case.

168
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,960
But I have to say I recently read Bill Bryson's book, A Short History of Nearly Everything.

169
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,779
And it talks about the history of the world and us and animals and plants in it.

170
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,940
And he talks about physics, especially.

171
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,659
And I think that if you're interested in that, I don't know.

172
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,059
I mean, if you're an advanced English learner, it might be challenging.

173
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,100
It was challenging for me.

174
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,980
But but it's definitely a good book to to read to learn about some of these things.

175
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,759
Yeah, it's actually a very good idea.

176
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:09,279
And I don't know, many of us, I think many of us as well growing up, maybe we had a hard time with some of these exact sciences like chemistry or physics.

177
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,100
So we obviously find it hard to be interested in it.

178
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,220
But, you know, it's very different because it's not math and formulas.

179
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,159
You don't really have to know how to derive, you know, the formula or anything.

180
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,120
You just kind of have to understand the theory.

181
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,740
And it's very, very interesting, I must say.

182
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,539
It is.

183
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:27,779
And it's it's fun because you can talk about it's like philosophy.

184
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,840
Sometimes you can talk about, you know, if this were the case, then what would happen?

185
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:32,179
Right.

186
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:33,659
These hypothetical situations.

187
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,480
And I think that's maybe more in line with theoretical physics.

188
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,360
But it's just it's really interesting to think about and to let your mind go into these very strange places.

189
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:43,019
That's right.

190
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,820
So actually, we are curious to know if you believe that maybe someday we will be able to travel in time?

191
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,080
Or do you believe that live in other on other planets?

192
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,139
Or we'll have space travel as a part of our holiday making?

193
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,679
Yeah, they supposedly already are arranging tourism to the moon, right?

194
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,559
Yeah, they are.

195
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,840
So I wonder if if one day like in the fifth element, we're going to have these cruises to space.

196
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,080
Yeah, that would be fun.

197
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,740
