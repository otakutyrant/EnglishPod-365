00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an advanced level lesson for you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This one's a bit difficult.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's all about science.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today we're going to talk about physics, specifically about, well, you know, things like Stephen Hawking and wormholes, black holes, and general theory of relativity and all that good stuff.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Right.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So we're in class.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're learning about physics today, and you're going to hear a lot of terms.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't worry if you're not really sure what they mean.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We'll be back in a moment to talk about them.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Good morning, everybody.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Welcome to Physics 101.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Ed Brown, and I will be your professor for the semester.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Since today is our first day, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this semester.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics, professor?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a broad overview of the field of physics.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The term physics encompasses many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will provide you with a conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove useful whether or not you choose to further your study in the field.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental concepts of physics.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Then by the middle of the semester, we will begin exploring the more theoretical side of physics.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It is essential that you first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Will we learn about black holes, worm holes, and string theory?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We will learn about the general theory of relativity, including black holes.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We will also explore the developing theories in quantum mechanics, such as string theory.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We will discuss some hypothetical features of space-time, like worm holes.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We will also explore some of the more influential developments in the field of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern life.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now I'm going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this class, so you can see how this course will be graded.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh man, looks like this isn't going to be the easy A I thought it'd be.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
So obviously we are in a class, as you said, and the professor is pretty much introducing the course and what's going to happen during the semester.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So he's talking about the different kinds of physics, or the different elements of physics, that will be a part of this course.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And there's a very eager student, he's very excited, and he wants to know, are these interesting things going to be a part of the course?

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And so when we started out, we talked about these two different fields of physics, and I think maybe it would be helpful to start there with these two branches of this field.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right, he mentioned this boy Matt said if they're going to be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now theoretical physics and experimental physics are what we call two different branches of physics.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That means they're both physics.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But people who do them have different methods and maybe focus on different things.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Theoretical comes from the word theory.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I have a theory about something, and I'm going to think about whether or not it's possible, and maybe there's some math involved.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But with experimental physics, the key word here is experiment.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That means we actually build experiments to test our theories.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So I guess theoretical physics, we can just have theories about how things happen or explain them, but we can't really prove them.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We can just have theories around them.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Maybe we can try and prove them mathematically.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But experimental physics, you can actually, as you said, create an experiment to prove it or not.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

50
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And so those are the two main branches that the young man asks about.

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But the professor says, you know, listen, we're going to be talking about the fundamental concepts of physics.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And so fundamental concepts are things that you often hear a professor talk about in your introductory class.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So introduction to mathematics or introduction to physics.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So fundamental concepts are the basics.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's right.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So the most important, but also the ones at the very bottom, the foundation.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because you can learn about more difficult or more complicated things later.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But first you have to have a foundation.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So those are the fundamental concepts.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Right.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And actually after the professor said that, this guy Matt went on to ask if they were going to learn about black holes, wormholes and string theory.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So three very important parts of physics, but very, very complicated things.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The first two are related, right?

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So we've got astrophysics.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Astro means star.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So astrophysics is the physics of things, bodies in space, planets, stars, things like that.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And so two concepts that we often talk about in astrophysics are black holes and wormholes.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I think many of you have already heard this word black hole.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The concept of it is basically a huge hole in space that just sucks up everything.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The gravitational force.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So the pull of gravity is so strong that nothing can resist it.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Everything that comes close to a black hole, it's like in a drain.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Everything that comes close to it gets sucked into it.

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No light can escape it.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's right.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the other concept there is a wormhole.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So it's basically a sort of bending of space and time in which you can travel from one point to another a lot faster than going in a straight line.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Or from one time to another.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So this is a very, very popular concept in science fiction movies and books.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
For example, Star Trek, the most recent movie, the new movie Star Trek, there was a wormhole.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So one ship goes from the future and it comes into the past.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So it has to travel through this wormhole.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's right.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So, and actually, yeah, you say science fiction and obviously it's hard to prove it, but this is one of the concepts that physicists think they can prove someday.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Someday.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And this is why it's a part of theoretical physics.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's right.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And what about this other concept, string theory?

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, string theory is a theory about the way the world works, basically.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And it is a theory that actually competes with Einstein's view of the way the world works, right?

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And string theory is about basically strings that are vibrating and that's the way the entire universe is kind of built.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, so basically at the subatomic level, usually you're supposed to have an atom, but also supposedly these atoms are made up of strings that, depending on the frequency at which they vibrate, they could constitute different elements or different parts.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Different kinds of matter, right.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Exactly.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And so we're talking about the very, very, very, very, very, very, very smallest building blocks of the things in the world, atoms and even quarks and jewels and those things.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Exactly.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So it's actually one of these new things that, well, people are talking about string theory.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's kind of this new way of seeing the world and explaining the unexplainable because there are so many things still in the world that we can't explain.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And people argue about this because obviously if you can't prove it, it's hard to say what is right and what is wrong.

104
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Exactly.

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But actually one thing that was proven was Einstein's general theory of relativity.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So this is something we all learned back in high school or in college.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So basically the general theory of relativity is this idea that space and time are not fixed.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're relative to each other.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So an example my teacher used to use is that when you travel very, very, very fast, imagine going around a jet around the world counterclockwise, time slows down the faster you move.

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
OK, so that proves that that time and space are not fixed.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Actually, this the general theory of relativity and specifically this aspect of speed and time was proven with the example that you give with two atomic clocks that you kept one on the ground, like, I don't know, in your house, and you put one in an airplane that was traveling faster than the speed of sound.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And so after maybe an hour, the plane would land and the clocks would have not the same time anymore, but they would be one the clock that was in the airplane traveling faster would be maybe half a second off or something very, very small.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But you would see that time moved slower because your speed is faster.

116
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All right.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So that's the general theory.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's a part of the general theory of relativity.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a very important theory in the history of the world, but also in the history of physics.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Another thing, though, that the professor mentioned that is very important in physics these days is quantum mechanics.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, this is actually a very interesting field of physics, but very hard to understand.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In my opinion, for me, it's very, very hard.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I find it very complex, too.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well, mechanics are the way the way things work.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Right.

126
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And so quantum is at the atomic and subatomic level.

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Right.

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And so you're talking about basically the building blocks of the things in the universe and the people who people who are studying this are working on this quantum mechanics.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They they don't like the Einsteinians.

130
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
They don't like the people who follow Einstein because these two theories, they don't actually go together very well.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You either have to believe one or you have to believe the other.

132
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, the problem is that when you're talking about when you're talking at the macro level, the way things work and the way things move, like, for example, you and me, of course, there are formulas in there, everything that explains and that prove that things are the way they are.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But the problem is that in quantum mechanics, at some atomic level, it's so different.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Like, for example, electronics.

135
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The reason why we're able to have microprocessors and electronics is because, for example, atoms can be in two places at the same time, which is impossible in our world.

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's like saying, you know, Catherine can be in two places at the exact same time.

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And there's also this problem of observation that I've read about.

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So there are some kinds of particles like electrons, for example.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That if you're observing them sometimes appear as waves, but if you're observing them sometimes appear to have mass.

140
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Exactly like light.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So you're talking about these things that seem to have a whole different set of rules from the rules that we have here, walking around and eating food and going to work.

143
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
And so I think that's what's fascinating about physics, that, you know, you can break things down to the very smallest parts and they seem very different.

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or you can think about the stars and the moon and, you know, these planets and they have their own rules, too.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And so, you know, there's that's why physics is such a very I think it's it's it's frustrating, frustrating, and it's exciting at the same time.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right.

147
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And actually, some of the other fields that the professor said they were going to explore are the fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism and even nuclear physics.

148
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So very important branches, I think, of physics as well.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So when you're studying physics or science, you will definitely hear about the laws of thermodynamics.

150
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Thermal means heat and dynamics means, you know, changing, changing state.

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And electromagnetism, of course, is the combination of two words, electricity and magnetism.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, like magnets, you have the plus end and the minus end, right?

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They attract or they repel.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then finally, nuclear physics.

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Nuclear physics is very important because it's again about the about atoms and breaking down atoms and finding out what their parts are.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So you might have heard about the Hadron Super Collider, right?

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's just like a big it's like a big racetrack for atoms.

158
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And they basically spin these atoms around the racetrack going faster and faster.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And then they put objects in their way so that they break.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They crash, they crash, and they study what the what the pieces look like and what happens and how much energy is released.

161
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's all very interesting.

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And it seems like things that are out of science fiction because it's not something mainstream that you hear about in the news very often or that sometimes we understand.

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like, obviously, we all hear about the gossip magazines and who's dating who and all this other type of news.

164
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But very rarely do we really pay attention to this type of information or news because it is a little bit complex to understand.

165
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And it seems that I think scientists are not the best writers for average people like you and me.

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They write in their own language almost.

167
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oftentimes, that's the case.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But I have to say I recently read Bill Bryson's book, A Short History of Nearly Everything.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it talks about the history of the world and us and animals and plants in it.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And he talks about physics, especially.

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I think that if you're interested in that, I don't know.

172
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I mean, if you're an advanced English learner, it might be challenging.

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It was challenging for me.

174
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But but it's definitely a good book to to read to learn about some of these things.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, it's actually a very good idea.

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I don't know, many of us, I think many of us as well growing up, maybe we had a hard time with some of these exact sciences like chemistry or physics.

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So we obviously find it hard to be interested in it.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But, you know, it's very different because it's not math and formulas.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You don't really have to know how to derive, you know, the formula or anything.

180
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You just kind of have to understand the theory.

181
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And it's very, very interesting, I must say.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It is.

183
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And it's it's fun because you can talk about it's like philosophy.

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sometimes you can talk about, you know, if this were the case, then what would happen?

185
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Right.

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
These hypothetical situations.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I think that's maybe more in line with theoretical physics.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But it's just it's really interesting to think about and to let your mind go into these very strange places.

189
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So actually, we are curious to know if you believe that maybe someday we will be able to travel in time?

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Or do you believe that live in other on other planets?

192
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Or we'll have space travel as a part of our holiday making?

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, they supposedly already are arranging tourism to the moon, right?

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, they are.

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So I wonder if if one day like in the fifth element, we're going to have these cruises to space.

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah, that would be fun.

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
