00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good afternoon, sir.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Is there anything I can help you with today?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Um, yeah.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No, not really.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm completely at a loss.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What is her favorite gemstone?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That purple one.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't worry.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That stone is an amethyst.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Take a look at this bracelet.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's a great statement piece.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, wow.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's really pretty.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Jess would love that.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Perhaps a necklace?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You could also get her a timepiece.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's both glamorous and functional.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Jess?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, she's very smart.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
She has a great sense of humor.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
She's very feminine.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've just been so nervous.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, I've decided.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to pop the question.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Fabulous.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We should look at engagement rings then.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, that's a whole other section.
