00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,459
Good afternoon, sir.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,619
Is there anything I can help you with today?

3
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,019
Um, yeah.

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,259
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,179
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:20,079
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,300
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,320
No, not really.

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:27,179
I'm completely at a loss.

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:34,240
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

11
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,619
What is her favorite gemstone?

12
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,439
That purple one.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,280
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,799
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:42,880
Don't worry.

16
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,479
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,159
That stone is an amethyst.

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,600
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,460
Take a look at this bracelet.

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,159
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

21
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,260
It's a great statement piece.

22
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,239
Oh, wow.

23
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:07,920
That's really pretty.

24
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,620
Jess would love that.

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,239
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate.

26
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,379
Perhaps a necklace?

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,040
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

28
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,620
You could also get her a timepiece.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,040
It's both glamorous and functional.

30
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,140
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:30,900
Jess?

32
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:32,599
Well, she's very smart.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,239
She has a great sense of humor.

34
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:36,000
She's very feminine.

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,200
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

36
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:43,120
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

37
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,180
I've just been so nervous.

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,659
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

39
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,560
Okay, I've decided.

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm going to pop the question.

41
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:55,599
Fabulous.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,280
We should look at engagement rings then.

43
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,400
Now, that's a whole other section.
