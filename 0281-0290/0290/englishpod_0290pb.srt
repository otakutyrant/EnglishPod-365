00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine and today we have a very romantic dialogue for you.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right, today we are at a shop and we are buying jewelry.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So of course there are many different types of jewelry and stones, so we're gonna take a look at all that great stuff.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's jump into our dialogue and see what's going on.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Good afternoon sir.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is there anything I can help you with today?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Um, yeah.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, not really.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm completely at a loss.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What is her favorite gemstone?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That purple one.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That stone is an amethyst.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Take a look at this bracelet.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a great statement piece.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh wow, that's really pretty.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Jess would love that.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You could also get her a timepiece.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's both glamorous and functional.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Jess?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, she's very smart.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She has a great sense of humor.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She's very feminine.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've just been so nervous.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, I've decided.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to pop the question.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Fabulous.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We should look at engagement rings then.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, that's a whole other section.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right, we're back.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Language takeaway.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In language takeaway, we have a lot of jewelry words and terms for you.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So let's take a look at some of these.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The first one I want to talk about, Marco, is pearl earrings.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The sales assistant offered a set of pearl earrings.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So we have earrings that you wear on your ears, right?

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Usually girls.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But what about pearl?

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Pearls are a kind of decoration that come from inside an animal.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The clam is a sea animal that opens up, and inside there might be a little pearl.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's usually a white or pink, very, very pretty object, and we sometimes put them in earrings or on a necklace.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So a set of pearl earrings or earrings that have this little rock or this little marble looking thing on it.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And well, he also offered a beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, a pendant is a kind of necklace, and basically a pendant is something that hangs down.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So in this case, it's a necklace that might have something on the bottom that hangs down like in the shape of a heart.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So that's what heart-shaped means.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It means that it has the shape of a heart.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
For example, you can have a heart-shaped cake.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You can also have a heart-shaped face.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, very good.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And of course, the pendant is a little thing that hangs from the necklace.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Now, maybe some pendants can also have a gemstone, and that's our next word.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So a gemstone is not just a normal stone.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a beautiful, normally expensive stone, and we often have gemstones that relate to a person's birthday.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Right, right.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So these come in many different colors and types.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The two that we heard about in today's dialogue are purple and blue.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's right.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The purple stone that you're talking about is the one that the shop assistant suggested, which is amethyst.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Amethyst is a purple stone.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's really, really pretty, and it's sometimes light, sometimes a little bit darker.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Depends on the one that you're looking at.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But amethyst is a little bit difficult to say, but it's a kind of gemstone.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The other one we heard about is called topaz.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, a topaz, and this one is blue.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So I guess they all look very much like diamonds, but they are different colors.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So topaz looks like a blue diamond, kind of.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right, and ruby is red.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And ruby is red.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Very good.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think there's a black one that's called onyx.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Onyx is black.

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Okay, so many different types of gemstones, and as Catherine said, usually each month has a specific gemstone.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So that's considered your gemstone if you were born on that month.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
All right, now moving on to our next word, we have another type of jewelry that usually hangs from a necklace, just like a pendant, but on this occasion it's a locket.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, a locket is something that usually women will wear around their necks.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now this is like a pendant, but it opens, so it's something that can open up, and sometimes people have photographs inside.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Many times they're shaped like a heart or a book, and inside you can see a picture or a note, something very personal.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, very good.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So it's very similar to a pendant, but as you said, it opens up.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You see it all the time in movies.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
People have pendants, and inside they have a nice picture of someone.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's right, so that's a locket.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All right, very good.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think we've taken a look at a lot of vocab related to jewelry here.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why don't we go back, let's review this dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is there anything I can help you with today?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Um, yeah.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, not really.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm completely at a loss.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What is her favorite gemstone?

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That purple one.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry, I've never bought jewelry for anyone, and I'm kind of nervous.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That stone is an amethyst.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Take a look at this bracelet.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a great statement piece.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, wow.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's really pretty.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Jess would love that.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You could also get her a timepiece.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's both glamorous and functional.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Jess?

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, she's very smart.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She's a great sense of humor.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
She's very feminine.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've just been so nervous.

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay, I've decided.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm going to pop the question.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Fabulous.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We should look at engagement rings then.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now that's a whole other section.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
All right, we're back.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Fluency Builder.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So the first phrase in Fluency Builder today comes from the beginning of our dialogue where Mark says to the shop assistant, listen, I'm completely at a loss.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, so what does he mean when he told the shopkeeper, I'm completely at a loss?

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
At a loss means I have no idea.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm really confused.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay.

155
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
All right, I need help.

156
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So if a teacher asks you a question and you don't know the answer, you can say, I'm sorry, I'm at a loss.

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm at a loss.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Or when I see someone and they say, hi, how you doing?

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They say, oh, I'm so embarrassed.

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm really at a loss.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't remember your name.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay, very good.

163
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I'm at a loss.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now when Mark was describing his girlfriend, Jess, he said, well, she's very smart and has a great sense of humor.

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, so sense of humor is a characteristic that we give to people.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So he has no sense of humor or she has a great sense of humor.

167
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And this means that this person likes to tell jokes and is funny and enjoys a good time, really.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So it means that this person is not really that serious or always angry or unhappy.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, not an overly serious person.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It generally means that the person is good at telling jokes and makes you laugh.

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So Jess has a good sense of humor.

173
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And because of all these things and they've been together for five years, Mark says, okay, I've decided I'm going to pop the question.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, this might sound very strange because you think, well, pop the question.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What is the question?

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, in English, the phrase pop the question has a very special meaning.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It means to ask someone to marry you.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So if I say I'm going to pop the question, that means I'm going to ask someone to marry me.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's right.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Or you could say he popped the question last night.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We're engaged.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So that means?

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He asked me to marry him.

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
All right.

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So it's a phrase to pop the question.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So whenever you use it together, you're talking about asking someone to marry you.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Exactly.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
All right.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Great stuff.

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why don't we go back and listen to this dialogue one last time?

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What is her favorite gemstone?

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That purple one.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't worry.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That stone is an amethyst.

201
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Take a look at this bracelet.

203
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

204
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a great statement piece.

205
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, wow.

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's really pretty.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Jess would love that.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You could also get her a timepiece.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's both glamorous and functional.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Well, she's very smart.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
She's a great sense of humor.

215
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
She's very feminine.

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

217
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I've just been so nervous.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

220
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay, I've decided.

221
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm going to pop the question.

222
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Fabulous.

223
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We should look at engagement rings, then.

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now that's a whole other section.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So talking about jewelry and all of these gemstones, we also took a look at different metal types.

226
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We talked about gold, which is, I think, one of the most popular types of metals.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's right.

228
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's kind of like a yellow color.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Now, when we talk about gold, we talk about 14-carat, 18-carat, 24-carat, stuff like this.

230
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yeah, so the carat, usually it's abbreviated like a K, 18K, 14K.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It means how pure the gold is.

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, and actually, they also use it in diamonds.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They talk about a diamond that's one carat or two carats.

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Right, so in diamonds, it has a different meaning.

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It actually means how much the diamond weighs.

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So some engagement rings are half a carat or a carat, and the really, really, really big ones are like two carats, and those are very expensive.

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's right.

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And we also saw another metal here, platinum, which is a very nice metal.

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It looks like silver, but it's stronger.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's much stronger, so you can hit something, and it won't leave an impression.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It won't change the look of the metal.

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And this is very popular right now for wedding bands.

243
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You know those rings that men and women get after they're married?

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Many people like to get this silvery-looking platinum ring.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've actually seen different types of metals that weren't mentioned in the dialogue, like titanium rings.

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Titanium is also a very strong metal.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Or I can't remember this metal, but it's used on spacecraft, and it's very, very strong.

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Stronger than titanium.

249
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know what it is.

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And yeah, they also make rings out of it.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But another interesting thing is some people make their own rings, their wedding bands or their wedding rings.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've seen that.

253
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's a very nice thing to do, I think, because it's meaningful.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
People like to do it together, and then they have these rings that are very special for them.

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So a person that makes jewelry or makes rings, it's called a jeweler, right?

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
A jeweler.

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right.

258
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So I have a friend who is a jeweler.

259
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He makes beautiful rings and earrings.

260
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, okay.

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So not only rings, a person that makes jewelry in general can be called a jeweler.

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
All right, a very interesting topic, especially for the girls who always love to have rings and diamonds and necklaces.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Or the boys.

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I know some boys really like to get earrings or to have jewelry like a ring.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I've never really seen too many guys wearing necklaces, though.

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
A lot of guys wear cross necklaces, I've seen.

267
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Or rings.

268
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Not too many rings.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't think it's a big thing.

270
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wedding rings?

271
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Well, a lot of American guys wear rings.

272
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, yeah?

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, I think.

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well, not a lot.

275
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
But some do.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So, well, obviously, it's popular all around, and of course, we are interested in hearing from you guys.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000

All right.
