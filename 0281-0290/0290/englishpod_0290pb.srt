00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,280
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,519
My name is Catherine and today we have a very romantic dialogue for you.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,580
That's right, today we are at a shop and we are buying jewelry.

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:18,339
So of course there are many different types of jewelry and stones, so we're gonna take a look at all that great stuff.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,219
Let's jump into our dialogue and see what's going on.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,640
Good afternoon sir.

7
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,859
Is there anything I can help you with today?

8
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,179
Um, yeah.

9
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,439
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

10
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,340
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

11
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,280
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,500
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,500
No, not really.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,359
I'm completely at a loss.

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,439
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

16
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,799
What is her favorite gemstone?

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,619
That purple one.

18
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm sorry, I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,659
Don't worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,340
That stone is an amethyst.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,799
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,640
Take a look at this bracelet.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,340
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

24
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:24,420
It's a great statement piece.

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,120
Oh wow, that's really pretty.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,799
Jess would love that.

27
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:34,560
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

28
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,219
We have this beautiful platinum pendant or you could also get her a locket.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,799
You could also get her a timepiece.

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,219
It's both glamorous and functional.

31
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,319
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

32
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,099
Jess?

33
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:52,780
Well, she's very smart.

34
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,420
She has a great sense of humor.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,200
She's very feminine.

36
00:01:57,099 --> 00:01:58,359
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,280
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,359
I've just been so nervous.

39
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,819
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

40
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,759
Okay, I've decided.

41
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,620
I'm going to pop the question.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,759
Fabulous.

43
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,479
We should look at engagement rings then.

44
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,659
Now, that's a whole other section.

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,039
All right, we're back.

46
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,939
So now let's take a look at language takeaway.

47
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,180
Language takeaway.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,479
In language takeaway, we have a lot of jewelry words and terms for you.

49
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,400
So let's take a look at some of these.

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,699
The first one I want to talk about, Marco, is pearl earrings.

51
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,439
That's right.

52
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,800
The sales assistant offered a set of pearl earrings.

53
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,840
So we have earrings that you wear on your ears, right?

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,840
Usually girls.

55
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,419
Yes.

56
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,860
But what about pearl?

57
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,060
Pearls are a kind of decoration that come from inside an animal.

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,879
The clam is a sea animal that opens up, and inside there might be a little pearl.

59
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:12,020
It's usually a white or pink, very, very pretty object, and we sometimes put them in earrings or on a necklace.

60
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,099
That's right.

61
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:20,819
So a set of pearl earrings or earrings that have this little rock or this little marble looking thing on it.

62
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,439
And well, he also offered a beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

63
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:31,319
Okay, a pendant is a kind of necklace, and basically a pendant is something that hangs down.

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,900
So in this case, it's a necklace that might have something on the bottom that hangs down like in the shape of a heart.

65
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,860
So that's what heart-shaped means.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,020
It means that it has the shape of a heart.

67
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,259
For example, you can have a heart-shaped cake.

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,139
You can also have a heart-shaped face.

69
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:48,419
Okay, very good.

70
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,900
And of course, the pendant is a little thing that hangs from the necklace.

71
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,099
Now, maybe some pendants can also have a gemstone, and that's our next word.

72
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:02,039
So a gemstone is not just a normal stone.

73
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:09,759
It's a beautiful, normally expensive stone, and we often have gemstones that relate to a person's birthday.

74
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,960
Right, right.

75
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,300
So these come in many different colors and types.

76
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,759
The two that we heard about in today's dialogue are purple and blue.

77
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:19,579
That's right.

78
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:26,540
The purple stone that you're talking about is the one that the shop assistant suggested, which is amethyst.

79
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,740
Amethyst is a purple stone.

80
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,300
It's really, really pretty, and it's sometimes light, sometimes a little bit darker.

81
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,160
Depends on the one that you're looking at.

82
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:39,000
But amethyst is a little bit difficult to say, but it's a kind of gemstone.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,939
The other one we heard about is called topaz.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,680
Okay, a topaz, and this one is blue.

85
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,819
So I guess they all look very much like diamonds, but they are different colors.

86
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,100
So topaz looks like a blue diamond, kind of.

87
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,839
Right, and ruby is red.

88
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,980
And ruby is red.

89
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:55,759
Very good.

90
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:57,800
I think there's a black one that's called onyx.

91
00:04:58,379 --> 00:04:59,060
Onyx is black.

92
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,620
That's right.

93
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:07,019
Okay, so many different types of gemstones, and as Catherine said, usually each month has a specific gemstone.

94
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:09,800
So that's considered your gemstone if you were born on that month.

95
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:21,540
All right, now moving on to our next word, we have another type of jewelry that usually hangs from a necklace, just like a pendant, but on this occasion it's a locket.

96
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,839
Okay, a locket is something that usually women will wear around their necks.

97
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:34,779
Now this is like a pendant, but it opens, so it's something that can open up, and sometimes people have photographs inside.

98
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:43,000
Many times they're shaped like a heart or a book, and inside you can see a picture or a note, something very personal.

99
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:44,100
Okay, very good.

100
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,379
So it's very similar to a pendant, but as you said, it opens up.

101
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,060
You see it all the time in movies.

102
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,579
People have pendants, and inside they have a nice picture of someone.

103
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,480
That's right, so that's a locket.

104
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,060
All right, very good.

105
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:59,339
I think we've taken a look at a lot of vocab related to jewelry here.

106
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,399
Why don't we go back, let's review this dialogue, and we'll be back in a bit.

107
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,019
Good afternoon, sir.

108
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,220
Is there anything I can help you with today?

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,579
Um, yeah.

110
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:14,839
I'm looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend.

111
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,740
Our fifth anniversary is next Friday.

112
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:21,639
Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her.

113
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,879
Is there anything in particular that you have in mind?

114
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:26,879
No, not really.

115
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm completely at a loss.

116
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

117
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,180
What is her favorite gemstone?

118
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:40,000
That purple one.

119
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm sorry, I've never bought jewelry for anyone, and I'm kind of nervous.

120
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:50,060
Don't worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

121
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,740
That stone is an amethyst.

122
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,180
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,019
Take a look at this bracelet.

124
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,720
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,839
It's a great statement piece.

126
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh, wow.

127
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,500
That's really pretty.

128
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,180
Jess would love that.

129
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,959
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

130
00:07:16,899 --> 00:07:21,600
We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket.

131
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,180
You could also get her a timepiece.

132
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,620
It's both glamorous and functional.

133
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,720
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

134
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:32,480
Jess?

135
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,160
Well, she's very smart.

136
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,819
She's a great sense of humor.

137
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,579
She's very feminine.

138
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,759
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,660
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

140
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,759
I've just been so nervous.

141
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,220
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

142
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,139
Okay, I've decided.

143
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,079
I'm going to pop the question.

144
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,160
Fabulous.

145
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,839
We should look at engagement rings then.

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,100
Now that's a whole other section.

147
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,439
All right, we're back.

148
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:09,279
So now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

149
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:11,720
Fluency Builder.

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:21,860
So the first phrase in Fluency Builder today comes from the beginning of our dialogue where Mark says to the shop assistant, listen, I'm completely at a loss.

151
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,839
Okay, so what does he mean when he told the shopkeeper, I'm completely at a loss?

152
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:30,839
At a loss means I have no idea.

153
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,659
I'm really confused.

154
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,559
Okay.

155
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,759
All right, I need help.

156
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:41,000
So if a teacher asks you a question and you don't know the answer, you can say, I'm sorry, I'm at a loss.

157
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,879
I'm at a loss.

158
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,120
Or when I see someone and they say, hi, how you doing?

159
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,360
They say, oh, I'm so embarrassed.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,379
I'm really at a loss.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't remember your name.

162
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,360
Okay, very good.

163
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,440
So I'm at a loss.

164
00:08:53,639 --> 00:09:01,320
Now when Mark was describing his girlfriend, Jess, he said, well, she's very smart and has a great sense of humor.

165
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Okay, so sense of humor is a characteristic that we give to people.

166
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,720
So he has no sense of humor or she has a great sense of humor.

167
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,600
And this means that this person likes to tell jokes and is funny and enjoys a good time, really.

168
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,960
So it means that this person is not really that serious or always angry or unhappy.

169
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,759
No, not an overly serious person.

170
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,899
It generally means that the person is good at telling jokes and makes you laugh.

171
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:28,700
Okay.

172
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,580
So Jess has a good sense of humor.

173
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:40,820
And because of all these things and they've been together for five years, Mark says, okay, I've decided I'm going to pop the question.

174
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, this might sound very strange because you think, well, pop the question.

175
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,100
What is the question?

176
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,559
Well, in English, the phrase pop the question has a very special meaning.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,120
It means to ask someone to marry you.

178
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,039
So if I say I'm going to pop the question, that means I'm going to ask someone to marry me.

179
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:57,700
That's right.

180
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,820
Or you could say he popped the question last night.

181
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,120
We're engaged.

182
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:02,759
Okay.

183
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,600
So that means?

184
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,379
He asked me to marry him.

185
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:05,899
Okay.

186
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,379
All right.

187
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,240
So it's a phrase to pop the question.

188
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,740
So whenever you use it together, you're talking about asking someone to marry you.

189
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:13,240
Exactly.

190
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:14,200
All right.

191
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,940
Great stuff.

192
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,299
Why don't we go back and listen to this dialogue one last time?

193
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:51,539
Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant.

194
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,899
What is her favorite gemstone?

195
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,720
That purple one.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,580
I'm sorry.

197
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,139
I've never bought jewelry for anyone and I'm kind of nervous.

198
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,179
Don't worry.

199
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:05,779
We specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment.

200
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,480
That stone is an amethyst.

201
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,919
We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces.

202
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,779
Take a look at this bracelet.

203
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,460
It's 18 karat rose gold studded with amethyst and blue topaz.

204
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,559
It's a great statement piece.

205
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,559
Oh, wow.

206
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
That's really pretty.

207
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,899
Jess would love that.

208
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,659
But I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?

209
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,320
We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket.

210
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,919
You could also get her a timepiece.

211
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,320
It's both glamorous and functional.

212
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,500
If you tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help you find something for her.

213
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,879
Well, she's very smart.

214
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,559
She's a great sense of humor.

215
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,299
She's very feminine.

216
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,480
Perhaps you could give her a ring.

217
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:00,379
Well, actually, I was thinking about asking Jess to marry me.

218
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:02,480
I've just been so nervous.

219
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,940
Well, sir, I believe your fifth anniversary is a great time to propose.

220
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,860
Okay, I've decided.

221
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,759
I'm going to pop the question.

222
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,860
Fabulous.

223
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,580
We should look at engagement rings, then.

224
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,799
Now that's a whole other section.

225
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,259
So talking about jewelry and all of these gemstones, we also took a look at different metal types.

226
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,820
We talked about gold, which is, I think, one of the most popular types of metals.

227
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,320
That's right.

228
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,820
It's kind of like a yellow color.

229
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:42,620
Now, when we talk about gold, we talk about 14-carat, 18-carat, 24-carat, stuff like this.

230
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:48,720
Yeah, so the carat, usually it's abbreviated like a K, 18K, 14K.

231
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,779
It means how pure the gold is.

232
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,500
Okay, and actually, they also use it in diamonds.

233
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,279
They talk about a diamond that's one carat or two carats.

234
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,659
Right, so in diamonds, it has a different meaning.

235
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,659
It actually means how much the diamond weighs.

236
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:15,299
So some engagement rings are half a carat or a carat, and the really, really, really big ones are like two carats, and those are very expensive.

237
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,039
That's right.

238
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,960
And we also saw another metal here, platinum, which is a very nice metal.

239
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:22,399
It looks like silver, but it's stronger.

240
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,940
It's much stronger, so you can hit something, and it won't leave an impression.

241
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:29,000
It won't change the look of the metal.

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,019
And this is very popular right now for wedding bands.

243
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,580
You know those rings that men and women get after they're married?

244
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:39,379
Many people like to get this silvery-looking platinum ring.

245
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,100
I've actually seen different types of metals that weren't mentioned in the dialogue, like titanium rings.

246
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,740
Titanium is also a very strong metal.

247
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:54,279
Or I can't remember this metal, but it's used on spacecraft, and it's very, very strong.

248
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,559
Stronger than titanium.

249
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,679
I don't know what it is.

250
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,240
And yeah, they also make rings out of it.

251
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,539
But another interesting thing is some people make their own rings, their wedding bands or their wedding rings.

252
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,279
I've seen that.

253
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,220
It's a very nice thing to do, I think, because it's meaningful.

254
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,000
People like to do it together, and then they have these rings that are very special for them.

255
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,440
So a person that makes jewelry or makes rings, it's called a jeweler, right?

256
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:17,440
A jeweler.

257
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:18,159
That's right.

258
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,220
So I have a friend who is a jeweler.

259
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,740
He makes beautiful rings and earrings.

260
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:23,460
Oh, okay.

261
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,559
So not only rings, a person that makes jewelry in general can be called a jeweler.

262
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:35,279
All right, a very interesting topic, especially for the girls who always love to have rings and diamonds and necklaces.

263
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,159
Or the boys.

264
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:41,480
I know some boys really like to get earrings or to have jewelry like a ring.

265
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,620
I've never really seen too many guys wearing necklaces, though.

266
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,320
A lot of guys wear cross necklaces, I've seen.

267
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,539
Or rings.

268
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:49,440
Not too many rings.

269
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,919
I don't think it's a big thing.

270
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:51,620
Wedding rings?

271
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,440
Well, a lot of American guys wear rings.

272
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:53,860
Oh, yeah?

273
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:54,580
Yeah, I think.

274
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,360
Well, not a lot.

275
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,340
But some do.

276
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,960
So, well, obviously, it's popular all around, and of course, we are interested in hearing from you guys.

277
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:08,980

All right.
