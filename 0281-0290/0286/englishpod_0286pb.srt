00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:10,039
My name is Catherine, and today we have the continuation of our series about giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,019
That's right.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,240
Today, it's part six, and on this occasion, we're going to address the audience.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,039
So we're going to talk to the audience and explain a couple of things.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,640
All right.

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,219
So let's take a listen to today's speech, and we're back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,240
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

10
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,000
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

11
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:46,579
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:56,579
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to alpha computers.

13
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:05,060
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here, and together we can really push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

14
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,420
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

15
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,780
How do we define the perfect laptop?

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,840
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

17
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,599
What do you look for in a consumer?

18
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,299
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

19
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,640
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.

20
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,640
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

21
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,959
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,140
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign, and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,959
I'm excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.

24
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,360
All right, we're back, and now let's take a look at five key words on language takeaway.

25
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,479
All right, so first up, Marco, we have a verb.

26
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:22,199
The verb is to devise.

27
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,759
That's right, so we devised a campaign.

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,840
Okay, so to devise in this case means to create or to come up with.

29
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:32,599
That's right.

30
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:41,000
I think in many movies, you will hear that someone will devise a plan to destroy the world, for example.

31
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:41,439
Right.

32
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,199
Right, or to devise a scheme.

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,740
So that's to create or to come up with a plan or come up with something.

34
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:59,539
And talking about the computers, he mentioned a couple of words that describe it, especially the affordability of the laptop computer.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,759
Okay, so yeah, there's this string of nouns that Mr.

36
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,539
Ford thinks are very important relating to the perfect laptop.

37
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:11,520
And in this case, affordability is the first one.

38
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,759
So something that is affordable is something that you can have the money to buy.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,099
It's not too expensive.

40
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,879
That's the adjective, affordable.

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,280
Affordability means whether or not something is expensive.

42
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:23,280
That's right.

43
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:30,360
So if you think of the adjective affordable, the noun would be affordability.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,039
So this is just the way that you can transform an adjective into a noun.

45
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:35,819
Right.

46
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,460
So this is something that comes up a lot when we're talking about buying things.

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,120
For example, Marco, I could say, what do you look for when you're buying a car?

48
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,120
Right, so I can say affordability.

49
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,419
And you could also say our next one, which is reliability.

50
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:51,520
That's right.

51
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,840
So if you look for a car, you are also looking for reliability.

52
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:58,900
And this comes from the adjective reliable.

53
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,340
All right, so something is reliable if you can depend on it.

54
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,020
It means, you know, in the case of a laptop or a car, it won't break easily.

55
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:08,879
That's right.

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,780
So a person can also be reliable.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,659
You can trust that person to help you, for example.

58
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,300
Or I could trust that he'll never be late or never forget that we have an appointment.

59
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,860
That's exactly right.

60
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,399
Well, moving on to the next part of Mr.

61
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:34,620
Ford's speech, he talked about the television campaign and how he really hopes to reach out to a huge audience with this television advert.

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,240
All right, so the reason we've chosen this is because it's important to remember this as a phrase to reach out to.

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,180
That means to connect with.

64
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:50,079
And I think your example of television is a really great one because television allows people to reach out to many, many, many people.

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,860
That's right.

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:57,740
Also, for example, with internet, you are able to reach out to many people all over the world.

67
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,920
So to reach out to is to connect with.

68
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:01,939
Uh-huh, okay.

69
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:12,899
And for our last word, when he was about to show everyone the TV advert, he said that tonight for the first time, we will unveil the first of these advertisements.

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,399
All right, so to unveil something is actually very exciting because to unveil something is to show it for the very first time.

71
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,180
That's right.

72
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,680
So maybe you've seen in car shows where they have a car under a big white sheet.

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,079
And on that night, they're going to unveil the new model of the, I don't know, the Ford car.

74
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,459
So that's what it means to unveil, to take away this veil and show everyone.

75
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,680
To unveil.

76
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,040
All right, so a lot of good key words there.

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,819
Why don't we go back and listen to Mr.

78
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,339
Ford again.

79
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,800
And when we return, we'll talk about Fluency Builder.

80
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,839
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

81
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,639
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,160
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.

83
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:16,199
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to alpha computers.

84
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:24,740
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here, and together we can really push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

85
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,040
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

86
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,379
How do we define the perfect laptop?

87
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,420
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

88
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,199
What do you look for in a consumer?

89
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,939
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

90
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,240
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.

91
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,240
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

92
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,500
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

93
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:10,839
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

94
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,600
I'm excited to say that today for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.

95
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,139
All right, we're back.

96
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,819
So now let's take a look at these four key phrases we've picked out for you today.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,740
Fluency Builder.

98
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,199
So in the beginning, Mr.

99
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:48,560
Ford is talking about this exciting X420 and he says that, you know, he would like to say that without the help of each and every one of you, the campaign could not have been created.

100
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,079
So each and every one of you.

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,740
That's right.

102
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,839
This is just a phrase where you emphasize that everyone helped you or that you are thanking everyone.

103
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,319
So in a speech, you can say, I want to thank each and every one of you.

104
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,339
So I want to thank everyone is basically what you're saying.

105
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,639
And it's interesting because it's kind of like you're saying every single person was important.

106
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,160
Right.

107
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,439
It's not just like, hey, guys, thank you.

108
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,519
It's like, no, thank you and you and you and you.

109
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,079
So each and every one of you, it really emphasizes that each person has helped.

110
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:21,759
That's right.

111
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:27,060
And it's a really nice way of, for example, thanking someone saying, I want to thank each and every one of you.

112
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,420
It sounds a lot more personal.

113
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:28,959
Definitely.

114
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:29,939
OK.

115
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:39,220
And he also used another very interesting phrase when he said, I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for your wonderful work.

116
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:50,299
So this makes me think of a person actually back when people used to wear hats every day, taking his hat off and maybe bowing.

117
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:58,059
This is something that used to be very polite because, you know, when you meet someone or you want to thank someone, you take your hat off as a sign of respect.

118
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:02,100
Well, we don't wear hats anymore, so it seems a little funny, but we still say this.

119
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:04,059
I want to take my hat off to Marco.

120
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,139
That means I want to thank you.

121
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,740
That's right.

122
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,440
So you're showing respect and you're also showing admiration maybe for someone.

123
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:19,179
So maybe if you meet somebody who saved someone's life, you would say, I really want to take my hat off and thank you for the work that you've done.

124
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,379
Yes, you're impressed.

125
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,899
You respect that person who saved that life and you want to thank them for their good deed.

126
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:25,820
That's right.

127
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:37,600
Well, moving on, when he continued to talk about Alpha Computers and the marketing efforts, he said, there's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce.

128
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,519
All right.

129
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,720
So another way to say this is I definitely think we have a great workforce.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,639
That's right.

131
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,440
You know, maybe not.

132
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,320
It's not as interesting.

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Right.

134
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,779
So we're making this more interesting by using a very colorful phrase.

135
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:59,759
And to say there's no doubt that you're a great workforce is good, but there's no doubt in my mind means there's there's absolutely no way that I could doubt this.

136
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,320
I absolutely believe that you are the best workforce.

137
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:05,220
So you can use it with anything.

138
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,440
You can say there's no doubt in my mind.

139
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,460
IBM computers are the best computers out there, for example.

140
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:18,159
Or there's no doubt in my mind that the Yankees will win the World Series next year.

141
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:18,860
That's right.

142
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,279
OK, so that's the way that you can use it.

143
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:24,860
You're basically telling people that you are very, very sure.

144
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,820
And what about our last phrase?

145
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,379
This phrase is a very interesting one when he says our campaign will really hammer home the point.

146
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,259
OK, well, you can make a point.

147
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:40,960
You can say, listen, our computers are state of the art and they're the best for your needs.

148
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:50,259
But to hammer home the point means to really emphasize this one important point and to say, listen, you will never forget this.

149
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,320
OK, you will not forget what I'm going to say to you.

150
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:55,340
So you really emphasize it and restate it.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,240
This is something that can be frustrating when you're a consumer, when you're watching an advertisement, because you hear them say, this is the best product.

152
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:04,419
You shouldn't buy other products.

153
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,639
This is the best product.

154
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,279
And they're hammering home the point.

155
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,419
They're repeating this message.

156
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,159
That's right.

157
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,179
So it's a colloquial phrase that you can use to really, again, put your point across.

158
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,440
OK, so a lot of interesting phrases there.

159
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,559
Why don't we take a break and let's listen to our dialogue again.

160
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,600
And we'll be back in a bit.

161
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,820
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

162
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:36,600
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

163
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,139
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.

164
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:53,179
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to alpha computers.

165
00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:01,679
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here, and together, we can really push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

166
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,980
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

167
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,340
How do we define the perfect laptop?

168
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,379
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

169
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,179
What do you look for in a consumer?

170
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,899
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

171
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:29,200
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.

172
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,200
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

173
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,539
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

174
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:47,820
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

175
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,559
I'm excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.

176
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,879
All right, so this was part six of our presentation series.

177
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:16,159
We still have four more lessons to go all about this, and they're going to get a little bit more complicated, and we're going to continue talking.

178
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,919
The next couple of lessons are actually answering questions from the public and many things like this.

179
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:39,120
Yeah, I think they're really useful because sometimes you prepare your presentation, you feel really good about it, but those questions at the end can be scary because you don't really know how to answer a question properly in English, or you don't know how to anticipate a question that you might get from the crowd.

180
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,120
Those are things that we would like to talk about in the next couple of episodes.

181
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:55,460
That's right, and remember that these phrases and how you see him presenting this laptop computer, you can still take a lot of the words, a lot of the vocab, a lot of the phrases, and kind of put it into your speech or your presentation.

182
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,580
You're going to sound great.

183
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,320
Absolutely.

184
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,000
State of the art, save that one.

185
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,419
But that's about it for us here today at EnglishPod.

186
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:04,879
We hope you've enjoyed this lesson, and we'll see you next time.

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,519
All right, bye.

188
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:05,820
Bye.
