00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have the continuation of our series about giving a presentation.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, it's part six, and on this occasion, we're going to address the audience.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we're going to talk to the audience and explain a couple of things.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All right.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's take a listen to today's speech, and we're back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to alpha computers.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here, and together we can really push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How do we define the perfect laptop?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you look for in a consumer?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign, and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All right, we're back, and now let's take a look at five key words on language takeaway.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, so first up, Marco, we have a verb.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The verb is to devise.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right, so we devised a campaign.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so to devise in this case means to create or to come up with.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think in many movies, you will hear that someone will devise a plan to destroy the world, for example.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right, or to devise a scheme.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So that's to create or to come up with a plan or come up with something.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And talking about the computers, he mentioned a couple of words that describe it, especially the affordability of the laptop computer.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay, so yeah, there's this string of nouns that Mr.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ford thinks are very important relating to the perfect laptop.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And in this case, affordability is the first one.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So something that is affordable is something that you can have the money to buy.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's not too expensive.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's the adjective, affordable.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Affordability means whether or not something is expensive.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So if you think of the adjective affordable, the noun would be affordability.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So this is just the way that you can transform an adjective into a noun.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So this is something that comes up a lot when we're talking about buying things.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
For example, Marco, I could say, what do you look for when you're buying a car?

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right, so I can say affordability.

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And you could also say our next one, which is reliability.

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So if you look for a car, you are also looking for reliability.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And this comes from the adjective reliable.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
All right, so something is reliable if you can depend on it.

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It means, you know, in the case of a laptop or a car, it won't break easily.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's right.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So a person can also be reliable.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can trust that person to help you, for example.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Or I could trust that he'll never be late or never forget that we have an appointment.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's exactly right.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, moving on to the next part of Mr.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ford's speech, he talked about the television campaign and how he really hopes to reach out to a huge audience with this television advert.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right, so the reason we've chosen this is because it's important to remember this as a phrase to reach out to.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That means to connect with.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And I think your example of television is a really great one because television allows people to reach out to many, many, many people.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Also, for example, with internet, you are able to reach out to many people all over the world.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So to reach out to is to connect with.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Uh-huh, okay.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And for our last word, when he was about to show everyone the TV advert, he said that tonight for the first time, we will unveil the first of these advertisements.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All right, so to unveil something is actually very exciting because to unveil something is to show it for the very first time.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's right.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So maybe you've seen in car shows where they have a car under a big white sheet.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And on that night, they're going to unveil the new model of the, I don't know, the Ford car.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So that's what it means to unveil, to take away this veil and show everyone.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
To unveil.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right, so a lot of good key words there.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why don't we go back and listen to Mr.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Ford again.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And when we return, we'll talk about Fluency Builder.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to alpha computers.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here, and together we can really push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

86
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
How do we define the perfect laptop?

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What do you look for in a consumer?

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

92
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm excited to say that today for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
All right, we're back.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So now let's take a look at these four key phrases we've picked out for you today.

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Fluency Builder.

98
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So in the beginning, Mr.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ford is talking about this exciting X420 and he says that, you know, he would like to say that without the help of each and every one of you, the campaign could not have been created.

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So each and every one of you.

101
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's right.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
This is just a phrase where you emphasize that everyone helped you or that you are thanking everyone.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So in a speech, you can say, I want to thank each and every one of you.

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So I want to thank everyone is basically what you're saying.

105
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And it's interesting because it's kind of like you're saying every single person was important.

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right.

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not just like, hey, guys, thank you.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's like, no, thank you and you and you and you.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So each and every one of you, it really emphasizes that each person has helped.

110
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And it's a really nice way of, for example, thanking someone saying, I want to thank each and every one of you.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It sounds a lot more personal.

113
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Definitely.

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
OK.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And he also used another very interesting phrase when he said, I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for your wonderful work.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So this makes me think of a person actually back when people used to wear hats every day, taking his hat off and maybe bowing.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This is something that used to be very polite because, you know, when you meet someone or you want to thank someone, you take your hat off as a sign of respect.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, we don't wear hats anymore, so it seems a little funny, but we still say this.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to take my hat off to Marco.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That means I want to thank you.

121
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So you're showing respect and you're also showing admiration maybe for someone.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So maybe if you meet somebody who saved someone's life, you would say, I really want to take my hat off and thank you for the work that you've done.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes, you're impressed.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You respect that person who saved that life and you want to thank them for their good deed.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's right.

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, moving on, when he continued to talk about Alpha Computers and the marketing efforts, he said, there's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
All right.

129
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So another way to say this is I definitely think we have a great workforce.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You know, maybe not.

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's not as interesting.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right.

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So we're making this more interesting by using a very colorful phrase.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And to say there's no doubt that you're a great workforce is good, but there's no doubt in my mind means there's there's absolutely no way that I could doubt this.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I absolutely believe that you are the best workforce.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So you can use it with anything.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can say there's no doubt in my mind.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
IBM computers are the best computers out there, for example.

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Or there's no doubt in my mind that the Yankees will win the World Series next year.

141
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's right.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
OK, so that's the way that you can use it.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're basically telling people that you are very, very sure.

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And what about our last phrase?

145
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This phrase is a very interesting one when he says our campaign will really hammer home the point.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
OK, well, you can make a point.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You can say, listen, our computers are state of the art and they're the best for your needs.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But to hammer home the point means to really emphasize this one important point and to say, listen, you will never forget this.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
OK, you will not forget what I'm going to say to you.

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So you really emphasize it and restate it.

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is something that can be frustrating when you're a consumer, when you're watching an advertisement, because you hear them say, this is the best product.

152
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You shouldn't buy other products.

153
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the best product.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And they're hammering home the point.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They're repeating this message.

156
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's right.

157
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So it's a colloquial phrase that you can use to really, again, put your point across.

158
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
OK, so a lot of interesting phrases there.

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why don't we take a break and let's listen to our dialogue again.

160
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And we'll be back in a bit.

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The campaign that we have in store for the X420 is exciting, imaginative, and revolutionary.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'd like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you, we really could not have devised this campaign.

164
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'd like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the wonderful work you've done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in continuing your commitment to alpha computers.

165
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There's no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here, and together, we can really push alpha computers to a whole new level of success.

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
On the subject of the campaign, let me ask you all a question.

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How do we define the perfect laptop?

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability?

169
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What do you look for in a consumer?

170
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the X420 is a state-of-the-art laptop for all of your computing needs.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
With our television campaign, we hope to really reach out to a huge audience.

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
We have a great ad campaign plan focused on the fantastic USPs of the X420.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We've hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the X420.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements.

176
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
All right, so this was part six of our presentation series.

177
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We still have four more lessons to go all about this, and they're going to get a little bit more complicated, and we're going to continue talking.

178
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The next couple of lessons are actually answering questions from the public and many things like this.

179
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, I think they're really useful because sometimes you prepare your presentation, you feel really good about it, but those questions at the end can be scary because you don't really know how to answer a question properly in English, or you don't know how to anticipate a question that you might get from the crowd.

180
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Those are things that we would like to talk about in the next couple of episodes.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's right, and remember that these phrases and how you see him presenting this laptop computer, you can still take a lot of the words, a lot of the vocab, a lot of the phrases, and kind of put it into your speech or your presentation.

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're going to sound great.

183
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Absolutely.

184
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
State of the art, save that one.

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But that's about it for us here today at EnglishPod.

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
We hope you've enjoyed this lesson, and we'll see you next time.

187
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
All right, bye.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Bye.
