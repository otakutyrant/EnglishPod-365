00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And as you've noticed on our website, we have a number of lessons about giving a presentation in English.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So this is one of those lessons.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we're talking about avoiding questions.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today, in part five of our presentation series, we're going to try and handle some questions or avoid questions, as Catherine said.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So why don't we jump into the dialogue.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's see what Mr.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ford is talking about now.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we'll be back in a bit.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector who might use laptops both for studying and gaming.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's no doubt that- Mr.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of the X420 is just too much for most students?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, that's a fair point.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Is that okay?

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, sure.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, so as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Firstly, we'll have a nationwide television campaign as well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We also intend to- I'm sorry to stop you, Mr.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I mean, how much is that going to cost?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, we're back, and now we can get started with Language Takeaway.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, so Marco, a lot of the conversation today was about markets and a target consumer, so perhaps we should start talking a little bit about who Mr.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Ford thinks this company's consumers are.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He mentioned that the Alpha laptop could also be aimed at the middle class.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We have different classes in society, especially in America, where we talk about people who are low income, they don't make very much money, or people who make a lot of money, they're rich, they're on top.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's the high class.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, high class.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But in the middle, we have the middle class, and this is just average people.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They make money, they have a car.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They're not rich, but they're not poor.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, so they're in the middle.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So this is the middle class.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The computer is aimed at the middle class market, but he said that it's middle class white collar worker.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, so I know this phrase exists in many other languages, but a white collar worker in English refers to the color of the shirt that you wear.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So white collar workers usually work in offices.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So because they're usually wearing suits.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right, they have to wear nice clothes, like suits and button-down shirts.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But we sometimes also talk about blue collar workers.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who are these guys?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Blue collar workers are usually people that are in trades, like for example, a mechanic or a plumber, because usually you see them wearing those blue shirts.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, uniforms.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They're usually people who work with their hands, or who are not likely to work in a big office.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So usually maybe these people are not middle class.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Maybe they are lower class.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
They can be both.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In America right now, I think you can make quite a bit of money if you're a plumber or a construction worker.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But he also mentioned middle class white collar worker with an above average income.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, so an income is the amount of money that a person earns, usually in a year.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So we say $30,000 a year.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's your annual income.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So when we talk about something that's average, that means it's normal.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But in this case, we're not talking about something that's average.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What are we talking about?

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's above average.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Above average.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So if the average income of a person in America is $36,000 a year, an above average income is $70,000 a year or $65,000 a year.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But for the middle class, maybe that's different.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So in the middle class, an average annual income is $70,000.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And above average income in the middle class is $120,000 a year.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So the phrase there, above average, you're just referring to something that's more than the normal.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's right.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So in this case, more than the normal income for a middle class worker, you can also say below average.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So a below average income is lower than most people earn.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, very good.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And well, continuing on talking about markets and the demographics, who were selling the computer to, we also talked about our target consumer.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, this is something that you often hear in meetings at work or in marketing departments.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A target is something you aim for.

81
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's something you want to hit or achieve.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And so a target consumer is the buyer, is a customer that you aim to have.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, so maybe you have some customers that they're students and you have some customers that they're very old.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But your target consumer, the people that you really want to reach out to, in this case, the middle class white collar worker.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So in the case of our dialogue, our target consumer is a middle class white collar worker, for example.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Okay, so a lot of marketing stuff here, talking about the computer and what Mr.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ford was saying.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's take a pause, let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back with some phrases on how to defer questions.

90
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there, both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners.

92
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But for any new product, we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer, and secondly, what do they expect from the next generation alpha laptop?

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle class white collar worker with an above average income.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly, and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for studying and gaming.

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's no doubt that- Mr.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of the X420 is just too much for most students?

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Well, that's a fair point.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

104
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is that okay?

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, sure.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay, so as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Firstly, we'll have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio, and also in many computer publications.

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We also intend to- I'm sorry to stop you, Mr.

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective?

110
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I mean, how much is that going to cost?

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Well, I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
All right, we're back.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So now, let's take a look at those phrases that we mentioned on Fluency Builder.

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So Margo, there was a phrase that I heard twice in today's dialogue that I think we should talk about.

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The verb is to tackle, so we heard to tackle a question.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Right, so when Mr.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ford says, I'll tackle that question a little bit later on, he's talking about, I'll answer the question, or I'll talk about that question later on.

119
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:23,000
All right, but in this word, to tackle, there's something kind of physical about it, because in football, we say that when someone tries to hit the ball from someone else, it's a slide tackle, and so to tackle a question means to really jump into it and try and solve it, and it's maybe not an easy question, so I'm going to tackle that later.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to tackle a challenge.

121
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's more than just to solve a problem or to answer a question.

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So maybe you can also tackle a project, a difficult project.

123
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's right.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So you know what?

125
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm going to give us two weeks to tackle this project, because it's a very difficult one.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right, very good.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And well, actually, when he was getting some questions from the audience members specifically, because he was kind of being interrupted, he was very polite about it, and to kind of defer the question, he said, you know what, that's a fair point, but I'll tackle that question later on.

128
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, and so this is a really great phrase if you want to flatter someone, make them feel good, before you tell them that you're not going to answer their question, or maybe you disagree with someone.

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So I could say, you know what, Marco, chocolate cake is the only cake in the entire world that people should eat.

130
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay, and I could say something like, that's a fair point, but in my opinion, vanilla cake is better.

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
All right, so see what Marco did?

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He made me feel good.

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He said, you know, fair point.

134
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's a good idea, but I disagree, or but, you know, in the case of today's dialogue, but we'll talk about that later.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Right.

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And actually, he did another smart thing in the way that he used his language skills here.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
When he was interrupted again, he said, hey, you know what, I'd be happy to answer your questions at a later time, or in the Q&A session.

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, so this phrase, I'd be happy to.

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'd be happy to talk about that at a later time, but right now I'm trying to explain something else.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Something else.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Exactly.

142
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So these are two really, really key phrases for trying to, in a nice way, change the topic or change the conversation.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So yeah, I guess you can say, yeah, I'd be happy to talk about that later on, or I'll tackle that question in a little bit, or that's a fair point, but we'll talk about it later on.

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Okay, so a lot of great language there.

145
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why don't we take a last listen to our dialogue and review everything we've just learned.

146
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Now, as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there, both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

147
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners, but for any new product, we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

148
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level.

149
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The question we must first address is, of course, who is our target consumer, and secondly, what do they expect from the next generation Alpha laptop?

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

151
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income.

152
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly, and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

153
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for studying and gaming.

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's no doubt that- Mr.

155
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

156
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of the X420 is just too much for most students?

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Well, that's a fair point.

158
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

159
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Is that okay?

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes, sure.

161
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay, so as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Firstly, we'll have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio, and also in many computer publications.

163
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We also intend to- I'm sorry to stop you, Mr.

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost-effective?

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I mean, how much is that going to cost?

166
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay, let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.

168
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
All right, so this was part five of our presentation series.

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We're halfway done with it, and so far we've seen a lot of interesting things.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And as you notice, it's an intermediate lesson, so it is a little bit more challenging and a little bit longer than your previous lessons.

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's right.

172
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
These are longer, and some of the phrases that you've learned, these words are very difficult.

173
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But as a reminder, some of the words repeat.

174
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So for example, in today's dialogue, we heard a lot about developing markets and campaigns, but we also heard about these last week in episode four, so if you're confused or you want some extra practice, I would recommend listening to some of the older lessons again just to review, because you're going to hear a lot of these words and phrases over and over again.

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's right.

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And of course, if you have any questions about this or any suggestions, you can also come to our website, EnglishPod.com, where we'll see everyone there.

177
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's right.

178
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So until next week, bye, everyone.

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Bye.

180
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Bye.
