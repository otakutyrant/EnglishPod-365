1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now, as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there, both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But for any new product, we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The question we must first address is, of course, who is our target consumer, and secondly, what do they expect from the next-generation alpha laptop?

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle-class, white-collar worker with an above-average income.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly, and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for studying and gaming.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's no doubt that...

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mr.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of the X420 is just too much for most students?

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, that's a fair point.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is that okay?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, sure.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Firstly, we'll have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio, and also in many computer publications.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
We also intend to...

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry to stop you, Mr.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost-effective?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I mean, how much is that going to cost?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.
