1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:14,859
Now, as we've already discussed, there's a huge untapped market out there, both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,719
Now, of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous rewards for the winners.

3
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:24,600
But for any new product, we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign.

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,859
It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level.

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:38,640
The question we must first address is, of course, who is our target consumer, and secondly, what do they expect from the next-generation alpha laptop?

6
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,560
Let's first of all tackle the first question.

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,600
Our target consumer for the X420 is the middle-class, white-collar worker with an above-average income.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,299
However, as we mentioned before, the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly, and we need to broaden our audience for this product.

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,679
For example, the X420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for studying and gaming.

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,560
There's no doubt that...

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,840
Mr.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,980
Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,299
You say that the computer is suitable for students, but you don't think the price of the X420 is just too much for most students?

14
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,379
Well, that's a fair point.

15
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,239
If you don't mind, I'd like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q&A section.

16
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:20,739
Is that okay?

17
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,599
Yes, sure.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:22,739
Okay.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,579
So, as I was saying, we have an exciting campaign planned for the X420.

20
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:34,019
Firstly, we'll have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio, and also in many computer publications.

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,640
We also intend to...

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm sorry to stop you, Mr.

23
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,060
Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost-effective?

24
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,420
I mean, how much is that going to cost?

25
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,180
Well, I don't have the figures to hand, but I'd be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,379
Okay, let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.
