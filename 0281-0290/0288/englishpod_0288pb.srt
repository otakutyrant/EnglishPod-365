00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today we are getting a tattoo.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, so a tattoo is a picture that you get on your body, and it lasts forever.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we're going to get a tattoo.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to talk about this very popular form of art on your skin.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And so let's start with the dialogue.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's listen to it, and we'll be back in a bit.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I have made up my mind.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm getting a tattoo.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Really?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you sure?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, why not?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They're trendy and look great.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Really?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of course.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you sterilize needles and the place is hygienic.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Ew.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right, we're back.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So now let's take a look at five key words that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Language Takeaway So the first phrase that we have here on Language Takeaway is indelible ink.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
When you get a tattoo, they draw it on your skin with indelible ink.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Okay, well ink is what you find in a pen.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So when you write, you write with ink.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And this is something that you can also paint with.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But in this case, we're talking about indelible ink.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So that means it's going to be permanent in your skin.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So something that is indelible means that you cannot delete or erase.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can't take it away.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, indelible ink.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or sometimes people just say permanent ink.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's right.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay, so obviously if you get a tattoo with indelible ink, it is, if you want to get it removed, now you can with laser treatment.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, so laser treatment uses this very strong light to take the, to burn the ink out of your skin.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And it is something that you actually have to go and do many, many times to get the tattoo removed.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've also heard that it's very painful.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, I've heard that it hurts a lot.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
More than getting the tattoo.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right, so laser removal or laser treatment is something that you do when you want to take a tattoo off your body.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I think they also used laser treatment to remove, maybe you have stains on your skin like from the sun, or even to remove hair, I heard.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, laser hair removal is something that many people do to take away some of the hair on their bodies that they don't like.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, so obviously because tattoos are forever, this friend is asking this other person to reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well to consider something means to think about it, so to reconsider means to think about it again.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Right, so if you're going to make a big decision, you should reconsider what you're going to do.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For example, I really want to have a hamburger for dinner, but maybe I should reconsider because hamburgers aren't very healthy, maybe I should decide on a salad or something.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Very good, okay.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So to reconsider, now obviously when we have a tattoo done, when we get a tattoo, they use this little machine that has a needle inside and it vibrates very, very fast and it kind of injects the ink.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So the friend tells this person to make sure that when they use this machine, they use sterilized needles.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay, so needles are those very small little things that go into your skin, they hurt.

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
When you get a shot, the doctor will use a needle as well, but a sterilized needle is a needle that is clean.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So something that is sterilized means clean.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's right, but it's clean for medical use.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That means that maybe someone used alcohol or even fire to clean something.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, so as you said, it needs to go through a process to be sterilized.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Like if you wash your dishes, they're not sterilized.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No, but if you are getting surgery on your body, the doctor is going to cut you open, he will use sterilized tools.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, very good.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And moving on to our last word, very much related to sterilized needles, we're talking about something that is hygienic, to make sure that everything is hygienic when you get a tattoo done.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, well something that is hygienic is clean.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So if you have a baby, you want to make sure that the room that the baby is in is very hygienic, so you clean it very often.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Maybe you use some sterilizer to clean the different surfaces and things like that, because babies can get sick easily.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okay, very good.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So we've taken a look at five keywords there.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again.

80
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We can review what we've just learned, and we'll be back in a little bit with Fluency Builder.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have made up my mind.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm getting a tattoo.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Really?

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you sure?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, why not?

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They're trendy and look great.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Really?

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you sterilize needles and the place is hygienic.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Ew.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
All right, we're back.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We only have three phrases today, but the first one is a phrase you'll hear very, very often in English.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's, I've made up my mind.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's right.

105
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The dialogue starts by saying, I've made up my mind.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I am getting a tattoo.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So what does it mean if you have made up your mind?

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, it means that you have decided something.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have decided to do something.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And the present tense of this phrase is to make up someone's mind.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I make up my mind.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You make up your mind.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He makes up his mind.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK, so if you're choosing something or making a decision when you finally make that decision, that means that you have made up your mind.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We maybe we're shopping, Marco, and you're thinking, well, do I want this or do I want that?

116
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, I'll say, come on, Marco, make up your mind.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It means just pick one.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Just decide, decide.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Very good.

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So a very common phrase to make up your mind, to make a decision.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And well, as we continued on with the dialogue, the friend was saying how the tattoos are forever.

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And if you want to get it removed, you need to use laser treatment and ends this part by saying, on top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:14,000
On top of all that, this means and even more so basically when you're trying to give reasons for something, maybe reasons for doing something or reasons for not doing something, you give your reasons at the end, you say and on top of all that.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So in addition or even more than that, this is the case.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So right.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So maybe we're talking about a car and you say, well, that car is not very reliable.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It uses a lot of fuel.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's very uncomfortable inside.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And on top of that, it's expensive.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And on top of all that, it's ugly.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So you're kind of listing things and you're telling the person why you think something is good or bad, and then you end it by giving a final reason.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And on top of that.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Exactly.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
All right.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And our last phrase, it's actually interesting because the place where you go and get a tattoo is called a tattoo parlor.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
OK, it's a parlor.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now, this is interesting because you might think that you would say a tattoo shop, but we don't say this.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So think about a beauty salon or beauty parlor.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A parlor is a shop where we we get our appearance changed.

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In this case, a tattoo parlor is a special shop where you can get a tattoo or in the case of this person, maybe get your your ears pierced or your tongue pierced or your nose pierced.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So a tattoo parlor is a place to go for that.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
All right.

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So a lot of phrases there.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's review everything one last time and we'll be back to talk some more.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have made up my mind, I'm getting a tattoo.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Really?

149
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you sure?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, why not?

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
They're trendy and look great.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Really?

157
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Of course.

158
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They use this machine with the needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

159
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

160
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you sterilize needles and the place is hygienic.

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ew.

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So talking about tattoos and also piercings, a very popular thing nowadays, especially we didn't touch on the piercing aspect of the dialogue to get your ears pierced or to get your tongue pierced means that you're going to create a hole in your tongue so you can put a ring or something in it.

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right.

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So many women have their ears pierced.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This means that they can wear earrings and these are small holes in the bottom of your ear.

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But a lot of people nowadays like to get their nose pierced.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So a hole in the side of the nose or their tongues pierced.

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's right.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You see people now get eyebrows pierced, their lips pierced, even below the lip, like, I don't know, near the chin, between the chin and the lip.

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They get this thing through it.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's very interesting.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah.

176
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Also, I've seen belly buttons.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Belly buttons get pierced.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's right.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And tattoos as well.

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Tattoos are so popular now.

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
People get tattoos, arms, legs, your neck, face everywhere now.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And there are special names for these in English.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:40,000
For example, if you have a very big tattoo in your arm from your shoulder to your elbow, that's called a sleeve tattoo because it looks like a permanent sleeve.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's right.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And actually, women get tattoos.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Also, but for cosmetic reasons, like many women get their eyebrows tattooed.

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, I've seen this.

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So some women like to get these tattoos that look like makeup.

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So maybe if you want your nice eyebrows all the time, you get these eyebrow tattoos.

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or if you want some some dark lines under your eyes, like eyeliner, then you get the eyeliner tattoo.

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Also, I've seen the lips, lip liner tattoo.

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
They do it around the lips to make it seem like you consistently have lip liner.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Interesting.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, I don't know if I do that because some days you just don't want to wear makeup.

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But actually, tattoos in many cultures are frowned upon.

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I know that until very recently in Japanese culture, tattoos were illegal because they were similar to the Yakuza.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And in Jewish culture, you're not allowed to have a tattoo on your body.

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And so that if you die with a tattoo, you cannot go to a Jewish graveyard.

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh, really?

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I've also heard that in many countries, some positions, some job positions you cannot obtain if you have a tattoo.

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, it's very interesting.

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't know why that would influence it.

205
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think it's definitely culture to culture because it's very popular in America right now to have tattoos.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But in China and Japan and East Asia, they're definitely frowned upon.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Even, for example, you know, the in the armed forces in the United States is very popular for them to have an American flag or something.

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You see it all the time in movies.

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But in other countries, you cannot join the armed forces if you have a tattoo.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Interesting.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, let us know, is having a tattoo OK in your culture or do people tend to think that it's a bad thing?

212
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or maybe you have a tattoo.

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do you have a tattoo or a piercing in your nose or your lip or your tongue?

214
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let us know.
