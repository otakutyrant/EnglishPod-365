00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,099
EnglishPod.com I have made up my mind.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
I'm getting a tattoo.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,300
Really?

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,160
Are you sure?

5
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:11,640
Yeah, why not?

6
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,580
They're trendy and look great.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,519
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

8
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,579
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,980
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

10
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,219
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

11
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:29,980
Really?

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,239
Of course!

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,219
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,539
Oh, I didn't know that.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,759
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,479
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,399
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you use sterilized needles and the place is hygienic.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,079
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,039
Ew!
