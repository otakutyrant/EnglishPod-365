00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com I have made up my mind.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm getting a tattoo.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Really?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Are you sure?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, why not?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
They're trendy and look great.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, but it's something that you'll have forever.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On top of all of that, I've heard it hurts a lot.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Really?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Of course!

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I thought they just painted on your skin or something.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure that you use sterilized needles and the place is hygienic.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Ew!
