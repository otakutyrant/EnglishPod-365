00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, so if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so I just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hmm, sorry about this.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Bear with me a second.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me see.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me check the connection a second.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, the connection seems okay and the computer is running normally.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hmm.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, sorry guys.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Obviously a problem with the system.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's just reboot and start over.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right, let's try again.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
No, still nothing, Michael.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We might need to cool it down for 10 minutes and start again.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay, guys.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But it's not a huge problem.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.
