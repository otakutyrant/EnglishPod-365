EnglishPod.com Okay, so if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

2
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,960
Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, so I just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,960
Hmm, sorry about this.

5
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:25,379
Bear with me a second.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,579
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

7
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,120
Let me see.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,399
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,460
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

10
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,759
Let me check the connection a second.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,579
Well, the connection seems okay and the computer is running normally.

12
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:48,520
Hmm.

13
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:50,719
Okay, sorry guys.

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:52,420
Obviously a problem with the system.

15
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,659
Let's just reboot and start over.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,539
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

17
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,060
Right, let's try again.

18
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:03,240
No, still nothing, Michael.

19
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:05,799
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,239
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

21
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,519
We might need to cool it down for 10 minutes and start again.

22
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,819
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

23
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,299
Okay, guys.

24
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,400
Unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

25
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,219
But it's not a huge problem.

26
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:29,599
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.
