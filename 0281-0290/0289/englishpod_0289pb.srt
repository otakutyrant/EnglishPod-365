00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have part seven of our series all about giving a presentation in English.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So obviously not every presentation is going to go perfectly.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sometimes we do have some problems, and on this occasion we're going to take a look at tech problems and how to handle them.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So you're going to learn some great ways to discuss and to explain technical problems.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let's take a listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okay, so if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Okay, so I just need to click this, and the advert should pop up on the screen.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hmm, sorry about this.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Bear with me a second.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let me see.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let me check the connection a second.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, the connection seems okay, and the computer is running normally.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hmm.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay, sorry guys.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Obviously a problem with the system.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's just reboot and start over.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Right, let's try again.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, still nothing, Michael.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay, guys.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But it's not a huge problem.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All right, so we're back, and now let's take a look at five keywords that we've picked out for you on Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, so we have some phrasal verbs today.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The first one is to kick off.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right, Mr.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ford started out by saying that we can kick off the first TV advert.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this phrasal verb, to kick off, what does it mean?

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It means to start something, okay?

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So to kick it off means to start.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I can say, tonight we're kicking off the party at eight o'clock.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right, or let's kick off this new product with a big party.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right, okay.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So the phrasal verb, to kick off, you've probably also seen it in sports.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I think in soccer, you have the kickoff, which is the same thing.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right, except it's a noun, so be careful with that one.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The kickoff is the very beginning of the game.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, very good.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
In that same paragraph, towards the end, we see Mr.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ford saying, okay, so I just need to click this, and the advert should pop up on the screen.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Pop.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I like this verb, actually, because it makes me think of that, but when you're using a computer and you have these little windows, or these little icons, those little pictures, when something changes, they appear quickly, and that means, in computer talk, it means to pop up.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right, you obviously maybe heard of this already.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You have annoying pop-ups, maybe you visit a website and all of a sudden these new windows start to open.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They're all advertisements.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Buy this, buy this, buy this, buy this.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Those are pop-ups.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But also, you can have a pop-up in a chat window, for example.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And in this case, we also use it as a verb.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It should pop up, so to pop up.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To appear.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
To appear.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
All right, very good.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now, obviously, it didn't work.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Something was happening with the projector, and Mr.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ford was going through maybe some of the problems, and he said, let me check the connection a second.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, the connection seems okay.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, connection is a very important noun, especially when we're talking about technical things like computers.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can have an internet connection.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This means how you are able to use the internet.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But in this case, we're talking about a projector, which makes things bigger, and a computer.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And so those things need to have a connection.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They need to have a cord or something that you plug into one and to the other so that they can talk to each other.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's right.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So as you notice, we are using it as a noun.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They need to have, the computer and the projector needs to have a connection.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So you have the verb to connect, but then you have the noun a connection.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right, and let's move on to another possible solution.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Mr.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Ford suggests rebooting the system.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, so the verb here, to reboot, is another special computer word that means to turn off and turn on again, to restart.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So if I say reboot, I'm using the prefix there, re, which means a repetition or to do it again.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If I just say boot, can I say just I need to boot the computer?

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I need to boot up the computer.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, boot up.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So in this case, you would be talking about a computer that is off and you want to turn it on.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So I would say, hey, Marco, can you boot up the computer for me?

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, about using the word reboot or to boot up, it's usually for electronic things, electric things.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You wouldn't say to reboot your car or to boot up your car.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, this is for computers, specifically electronics.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
For example, oh, man, my iPhone just froze.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I need to reboot it.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, very good.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right, and for our last phrasal verb for today, on language takeaway, we have towards the end of the dialogue, towards the end of the dialogue, Mr.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ford apologizes and says, you know what, I'm sorry, but technical problems do crop up sometimes.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, so this verb to crop up means to appear or to happen, but not all the time.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So unexpectedly or occasionally.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's right.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So these things do crop up sometimes.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It means every once in a while this problem will happen.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So can I use this for a person?

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you say, oh, you scared me, you cropped up on me.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, it would be creeped up on me.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Creeped up, very good.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So we can't confuse those two, but they sound very similar.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They do sound similar, but to crop up is usually a problem or an event or a thing that happens, and it happens not very often.

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, very good.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So I think we've taken a look at a lot of words here, specifically phrasal verbs, so let's review those.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's listen to our dialogue again.

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, so if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, so I just need to click this, and the advert should pop up on the screen.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hmm, sorry about this.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Bear with me a second.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let me see.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let me check the connection a second.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Well, the connection seems okay, and the computer is running normally.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hmm.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, sorry guys.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Obviously a problem with the system.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's just reboot and start over.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right, let's try again.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No, still nothing, Michael.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

135
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, guys.

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But it's not a huge problem.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And what we're looking to achieve overall with this campaign.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
All right, we're back.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So now let's take a look at some phrases on Fluency Builder.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Fluency Builder.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So this first phrase we have is very important, especially when we're using video or a projector in a presentation.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We say, let's dim the lights.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's right.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So we have the verb to dim.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So to dim something is to make it darker.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But not turn it off completely.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It means maybe to lower the lights.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We could actually see this on a computer also when the screen is very, very bright.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We say, oh, it's too bright.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I need you to dim it a little, make it a little bit darker.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So you can use this verb to dim to make it a little bit darker or to make it lower in intensity.

159
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's right.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Dim the color, dim the lights.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
All right.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Very good.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now, Mr.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ford, when he was talking about the advert, he said, well, it's new and it's not ready yet completely, so it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is a very, very popular phrase that means that something is incomplete.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Maybe it's not perfect yet.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It needs some work.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So if maybe you're designing a new website and it's maybe 50% done.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So you say the website is almost finished, but it's still rough around the edges.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We need to make some changes to fix it.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's right.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So rough around the edges is a phrase that is the opposite of the word polished.

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Something is polished if it's perfect and ready to go.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And, well, when the technical problem started, Mr.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Ford was apologizing and said, hey, look, I'm sorry.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And he also used this interesting phrase, bear with me.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Bear with me a second.

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So this is interesting because it's not the animal, the bear.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Right, right.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is different.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This means, you know, excuse me, please be patient.

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I have to do something and you have to wait.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So this is a very, very polite way of asking some people or some person to wait for you.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
To tolerate.

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So both the animal bear and to bear with me are spelled the same way.

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It looks exactly like the animal, but we're not talking about the animal.

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, we're asking someone to tolerate something that's annoying or frustrating.

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So, for example, I'm trying to show you a file on my computer, Marco.

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My computer's not working.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I say, please bear with me a second.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Right.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have to reboot my computer.

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's right.

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
We have to wait here.

199
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, very good.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now, towards the end of the dialogue, when we talked about to crop up, the second part of that, Mr.

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ford said, unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So we already discussed cropped up.

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What is time to time mean?

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
From time to time.

205
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, think of this as a set phrase because we said already that you could also say sometimes.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So from time to time means every once in a while or occasionally.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So it's an adverbial phrase.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's a way of telling people how often something happens.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But in this case, it's not very common.

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, for example, you can say, I like to go to the movies from time to time.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So maybe once or twice a month you like to go to the movies.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But what if I come to work every day?

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do I come to work from time to time?

215
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Okay.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
So from time to time is rarely or occasionally.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Not very often.

218
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
All right.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Very good.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So now let's listen to our dialogue one last time and review everything we've just learned.

221
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So if we could dim the lights, Jonathan, we can kick off with the first TV advert.

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough around the edges.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Okay.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So I just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hmm.

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Sorry about this.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Bear with me a second.

229
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There seems to be a problem with the projector.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let me see.

231
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Jonathan, could you lend a hand a second?

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer.

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let me check the connection a second.

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, the connection seems okay and the computer is running normally.

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hmm.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Sorry guys.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Obviously a problem with the system.

239
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's just reboot and start over.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's see if this resolves the issue.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Right.

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's try again.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Still nothing, Michael.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There might be a technical issue with the projector.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think maybe the projector has overheated.

247
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We might need to cool it down for 10 minutes and start again.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll call IT support to come over right now.

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay guys.

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Unfortunately, technical problems do crop up from time to time, don't they?

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But it's not a huge problem.

252
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
In the meantime, while the IT guys get to work on that, I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.

253
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
All right.

255
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
So this was part seven of our presentation series.

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And actually these type of problems occur very, very often, specifically with the laptop and the projector.

257
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And sometimes it doesn't work.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It doesn't recognize it.

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And so this is a nice way of handling it.

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And we hope that these are phrases that you can use in your daily life as well.

262
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Maybe you're working with your colleagues and you're having some technical problems.

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Or if you're having a problem and someone gives you instructions for how to solve that problem.

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like I often get this from my technical team.

265
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I say, listen, I have a problem.

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And they say, hey, just reboot your computer and it will be okay.

267
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
So these are very, very common issues that I think that you can learn how to describe in English with today's lesson.

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
All right.

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Very good.

270
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000

274

Bye.
