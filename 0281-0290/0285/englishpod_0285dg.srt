1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The air conditioning is not working.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Dan is on top of that.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That would be convenient.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's really annoying.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, you're right.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This office is falling apart.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I know.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.
