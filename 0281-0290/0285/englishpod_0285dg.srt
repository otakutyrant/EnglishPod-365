1
00:00:06,699 --> 00:00:08,720
The air conditioning is not working.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,640
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

3
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:13,320
Dan is on top of that.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,780
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:20,120
That would be convenient.

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,859
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,600
It's really annoying.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,160
Yeah, you're right.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,519
This office is falling apart.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,759
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:37,899
I know.

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,460
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.

14
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,579
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.
