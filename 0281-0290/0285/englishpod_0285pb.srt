00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,620
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,320
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,660
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:11,380
This is about fixing things.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,119
That's right.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,780
So sometimes in our office or in our house, some small things may break, like maybe the door or the air conditioning.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,379
So in this case, we need to call a special guy to come and fix it.

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,219
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about who this guy is.

9
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,659
The air conditioning is not working.

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,600
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

11
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,259
Dan is on top of that.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,759
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

13
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,039
That would be convenient.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,799
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:53,539
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

16
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,539
It's really annoying.

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,100
Yeah, you're right.

18
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:58,479
This office is falling apart.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,700
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged, and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,859
I know.

21
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:09,400
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,659
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,879
All right, we're back.

24
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,060
So now let's take a look at some of those key words and phrases on language takeaway.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,480
Language takeaway.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,359
Our first word today is the name of this job.

27
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,519
The person is called a handyman.

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,519
Okay, so that's a profession.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
You are a handyman.

30
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,540
Now what exactly does a handyman do?

31
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,780
Well, a handyman fixes things.

32
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:43,060
He is usually a generalist.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,379
He fixes things all over the house, not just the bathroom or the kitchen.

34
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:51,439
So he can just fix things that are a little bit broken.

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:02:03,620
But if, for example, your car needs a new radiator or it needs a new important part, maybe you would take the car to someone who's more experienced with cars.

36
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:07,340
But in the case of a handyman, if anything's broken, he can generally fix it.

37
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:18,180
Okay, so as Catherine explained, basically a handyman just does any type or many types of general work of things that may be broken around the house or the office.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,840
We had a couple examples of these in today's dialogue, didn't we?

39
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,659
What was that first one?

40
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:22,219
Kind of gross.

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,699
Yeah, well, he had to fix the air conditioning, but then he also had to fix the bathroom toilet because it kept clogging up.

42
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,639
Okay, so a toilet gets clogged up.

43
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:36,180
To clog up.

44
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,479
What does this mean?

45
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:45,360
So it means that something is blocking the way of the water being able to go out.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,159
So the water doesn't go down.

47
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:57,020
And sometimes if the toilet is really clogged and someone tries to flush the toilet again, the water comes onto the floor and it's very dirty and very gross.

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,800
That's right.

49
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:06,060
So actually, maybe sometimes in the kitchen, pieces of food may fall into the sink and it may clog up the sink.

50
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,840
Okay, so to clog up means to block or to get in the way of.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,599
That's right.

52
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:18,759
And apart from the toilets being clogged up, he also may have to take a look at the circuit breakers.

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,659
All right, so this is not about water or about plumbing.

54
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:32,780
Circuit breakers have to do with electricity and in this case, that box in your apartment or near your apartment that controls the different circuits.

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:42,120
So sometimes if the lights go out, you know that you have to check the circuit breaker and make sure that the circuits are all working properly.

56
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,900
That's right.

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,219
So the circuit breakers are kind of like a protection from too much electricity and that's why they go out.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,939
And now for our final word on language takeaway.

59
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:58,539
Something that also got clogged up at their office, we're talking about the gutters.

60
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:04,180
All right, so many people's houses have gutters or sometimes an office building will have gutters.

61
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:12,939
These are trays on the roof of a house or a building that will catch the water when it rains.

62
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:20,720
Because you know, sometimes rainwater can be very, very heavy and it's dangerous on your house, on the roof of your house because it can hurt the roof.

63
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,879
But if it comes into this gutter, into this little tray, then it will come down and fall on the ground.

64
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,439
So these are a way to protect your roof, but these often get clogged up with leaves and with garbage.

65
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,319
That's right.

66
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:43,519
So they're like small little ways or little roads, if you want to call them, where the water can go and escape and go into a specific place.

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,160
We have them on the sides of roads as well many times.

68
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:53,259
So gutters that you find on the ground, sometimes you find them on the roof of a house, but those are a little bit different.

69
00:04:53,259 --> 00:05:05,040
The gutters on the ground are basically pathways for water to come down because if there's no gutter, then all of the water is on the road and it can flood very quickly.

70
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:13,079
And so this is a way for the water and even the garbage to go on the side of the road and not be in the way of the cars.

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,560
That's right.

72
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,839
You see them on highways and roads very often because you don't want the road filled with water.

73
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:24,759
So these gutters are a small path where all the water will fall into it and escape safely from the highway.

74
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:25,680
That's right.

75
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:26,399
All right.

76
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,600
So that's all the time we have for language takeaway.

77
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,680
Why don't we go back, have another listen to the dialogue and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

78
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,240
The air conditioning is not working.

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,160
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

80
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,800
Dan is on top of that.

81
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,319
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

82
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,620
That would be convenient.

83
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,360
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,100
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

85
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,100
It's really annoying.

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
Yeah, you're right.

87
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,019
This office is falling apart.

88
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,279
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

89
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:11,420
I know.

90
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,959
I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day.

91
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,439
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

92
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,920
Now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,259
Well, this first phrase is a phrase that I like to use and I do use it very often.

94
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:37,180
We heard that Dan is on top of that, all right?

95
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,620
So we need to call a handyman in here and he says, nope, Dan is on top of that.

96
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,379
So to be on top of something, what does it mean?

97
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:53,519
Well, when she says Dan is on top of that, she's basically saying Dan is taking care of this or Dan is already calling the handyman to come and fix it.

98
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,920
So you are aware of the problem and you're trying to solve it.

99
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,560
Okay, so don't worry.

100
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,399
You don't have to call the handyman.

101
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,000
Dan is on top of that.

102
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,160
Dan will call him.

103
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,339
So to be on top of something is to make sure that something is done.

104
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:13,759
So you could say, Marco, I hope you stay on top of that project because it's very important.

105
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,139
Right, or don't worry, the report will be finished on time.

106
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I am on top of that.

107
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:18,759
Great.

108
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, now moving on to our next phrase, they were talking about all the problems that this office has and the person said, well, they might as well ask the handyman to also fix the electrical wiring.

109
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,399
Okay, so this phrase might as well is, it's kind of hard to understand, I think, sometimes.

110
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,120
Basically what the speaker is saying is that while he is doing this, he can also do something else.

111
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,360
Okay, so he's here.

112
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,720
He can fix many things.

113
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,959
He might as well also fix electrical wiring.

114
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:59,600
Right, so taking advantage of the fact that you are already doing something or you are already here, you can start doing something else as well.

115
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,319
Or maybe we could say this in a different context, like, you know, we're going to order a pizza for lunch.

116
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,540
You know what, Marco, might as well order two because there are so many people here.

117
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,759
So taking advantage of the fact that we are ordering pizza, we might as well get more and more for everyone.

118
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:24,980
Okay, and for our last phrase, when they mentioned all the work that has to be done, they said the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

119
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,959
Okay, so if someone has his work cut out for him, it means that he has a lot of work to do.

120
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,540
That's right.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,440
You can also say this to someone that you're talking to.

122
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,940
So Marco, Marco's writing a book, and I say, hey, Marco, that's a really long book you're writing.

123
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,980
It looks like you really have your work cut out for you.

124
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,799
That's right.

125
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:46,480
Or maybe this project is really difficult.

126
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,620
I really have my work cut out.

127
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,139
Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,179
Okay, so you're basically saying I have a very hard time ahead of me.

129
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:54,659
Mm-hmm.

130
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,820
Okay, so that's all the phrases we have for you.

131
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,539
Why don't we have a listen to our dialogue one last time?

132
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,620
The air conditioning is not working.

133
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,519
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

134
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,200
Dan is on top of that.

135
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:18,700
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,980
That would be convenient.

137
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,740
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

138
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,480
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

139
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,480
It's really annoying.

140
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,059
Yeah, you're right.

141
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,399
This office is falling apart.

142
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:36,659
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged, and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

143
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:37,779
I know.

144
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,360
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.

145
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,799
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

146
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,940
So a handyman is also commonly referred to as a jack of all trades.

147
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,960
That's right.

148
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,039
So these are both kind of funny words.

149
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,340
First of all, handy as an adjective means useful or helpful.

150
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,960
So maybe a hammer is a handy tool.

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,299
It's a very handy tool.

152
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,779
I find my iPhone has some very handy applications.

153
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:10,100
I can use the dictionary.

154
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,899
So a handyman is someone who's helpful.

155
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,960
He can do many things.

156
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:22,379
But a jack of all trades is very special because it means he is a person that can do basically any job.

157
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,320
So sometimes in offices, people may have someone that they may refer to as a jack of all trades.

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,220
So he may fix the computers.

159
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:37,440
He also knows a little bit about marketing and does many odd and random things around the office.

160
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:37,980
That's right.

161
00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:40,940
You could say, my friend Paul, he's a jack of all trades.

162
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,860
He can fix a car.

163
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,879
He can cook.

164
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,700
He can fix a door or a window, but he can also sew.

165
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,740
So he's a jack of all trades.

166
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,879
He has many, many skills.

167
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:52,519
That's right.

168
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,899
And talking about these skills, being a handyman is not a profession per se.

169
00:10:56,899 --> 00:10:58,019
It's actually a trade.

170
00:10:58,539 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,940
And so we say this because it's something that you normally do with your hands.

172
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,379
And you don't have to go to university to study it.

173
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,159
You maybe have an apprenticeship where you study by working.

174
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:16,039
And it's one of a few very, very important trades, like being a plumber or an electrician.

175
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,860
But a handyman is more general.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,700
Like we said, you can do many different things.

177
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:20,259
That's right.

178
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:21,559
So very interesting.

179
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,120
There are many trades out there.

180
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:32,440
Maybe you can come on the site and mention some of these that you may know, like, for example, a very well-known trade is a cobbler, a person that makes shoes, right?

181
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,120
Makes shoes or fixes shoes.

182
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,720
It's a very weird word, though, because shoes and cobbler don't seem to have much to do with each other.

183
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,320
Well, many, many, many trades like this.

184
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,820
I know before, they used to be blacksmiths, right?

185
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,259
So many types of trades.

186
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,840

Bye, everyone.
