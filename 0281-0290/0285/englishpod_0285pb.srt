00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is about fixing things.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So sometimes in our office or in our house, some small things may break, like maybe the door or the air conditioning.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So in this case, we need to call a special guy to come and fix it.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about who this guy is.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The air conditioning is not working.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Dan is on top of that.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That would be convenient.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's really annoying.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, you're right.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This office is falling apart.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged, and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I know.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
All right, we're back.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So now let's take a look at some of those key words and phrases on language takeaway.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Language takeaway.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Our first word today is the name of this job.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The person is called a handyman.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, so that's a profession.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are a handyman.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Now what exactly does a handyman do?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, a handyman fixes things.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He is usually a generalist.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He fixes things all over the house, not just the bathroom or the kitchen.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So he can just fix things that are a little bit broken.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But if, for example, your car needs a new radiator or it needs a new important part, maybe you would take the car to someone who's more experienced with cars.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But in the case of a handyman, if anything's broken, he can generally fix it.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, so as Catherine explained, basically a handyman just does any type or many types of general work of things that may be broken around the house or the office.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We had a couple examples of these in today's dialogue, didn't we?

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What was that first one?

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Kind of gross.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, well, he had to fix the air conditioning, but then he also had to fix the bathroom toilet because it kept clogging up.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, so a toilet gets clogged up.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
To clog up.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What does this mean?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So it means that something is blocking the way of the water being able to go out.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So the water doesn't go down.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And sometimes if the toilet is really clogged and someone tries to flush the toilet again, the water comes onto the floor and it's very dirty and very gross.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's right.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So actually, maybe sometimes in the kitchen, pieces of food may fall into the sink and it may clog up the sink.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, so to clog up means to block or to get in the way of.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And apart from the toilets being clogged up, he also may have to take a look at the circuit breakers.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right, so this is not about water or about plumbing.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Circuit breakers have to do with electricity and in this case, that box in your apartment or near your apartment that controls the different circuits.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So sometimes if the lights go out, you know that you have to check the circuit breaker and make sure that the circuits are all working properly.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So the circuit breakers are kind of like a protection from too much electricity and that's why they go out.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And now for our final word on language takeaway.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Something that also got clogged up at their office, we're talking about the gutters.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All right, so many people's houses have gutters or sometimes an office building will have gutters.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
These are trays on the roof of a house or a building that will catch the water when it rains.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because you know, sometimes rainwater can be very, very heavy and it's dangerous on your house, on the roof of your house because it can hurt the roof.

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But if it comes into this gutter, into this little tray, then it will come down and fall on the ground.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So these are a way to protect your roof, but these often get clogged up with leaves and with garbage.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So they're like small little ways or little roads, if you want to call them, where the water can go and escape and go into a specific place.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We have them on the sides of roads as well many times.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So gutters that you find on the ground, sometimes you find them on the roof of a house, but those are a little bit different.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The gutters on the ground are basically pathways for water to come down because if there's no gutter, then all of the water is on the road and it can flood very quickly.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And so this is a way for the water and even the garbage to go on the side of the road and not be in the way of the cars.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You see them on highways and roads very often because you don't want the road filled with water.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So these gutters are a small path where all the water will fall into it and escape safely from the highway.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's right.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All right.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So that's all the time we have for language takeaway.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why don't we go back, have another listen to the dialogue and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The air conditioning is not working.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Dan is on top of that.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That would be convenient.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's really annoying.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah, you're right.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This office is falling apart.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

89
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, this first phrase is a phrase that I like to use and I do use it very often.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We heard that Dan is on top of that, all right?

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So we need to call a handyman in here and he says, nope, Dan is on top of that.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So to be on top of something, what does it mean?

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, when she says Dan is on top of that, she's basically saying Dan is taking care of this or Dan is already calling the handyman to come and fix it.

98
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So you are aware of the problem and you're trying to solve it.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, so don't worry.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You don't have to call the handyman.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Dan is on top of that.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Dan will call him.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So to be on top of something is to make sure that something is done.

104
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So you could say, Marco, I hope you stay on top of that project because it's very important.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right, or don't worry, the report will be finished on time.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I am on top of that.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Great.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:32,000
All right, now moving on to our next phrase, they were talking about all the problems that this office has and the person said, well, they might as well ask the handyman to also fix the electrical wiring.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, so this phrase might as well is, it's kind of hard to understand, I think, sometimes.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Basically what the speaker is saying is that while he is doing this, he can also do something else.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay, so he's here.

112
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He can fix many things.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He might as well also fix electrical wiring.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Right, so taking advantage of the fact that you are already doing something or you are already here, you can start doing something else as well.

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Or maybe we could say this in a different context, like, you know, we're going to order a pizza for lunch.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You know what, Marco, might as well order two because there are so many people here.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So taking advantage of the fact that we are ordering pizza, we might as well get more and more for everyone.

118
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay, and for our last phrase, when they mentioned all the work that has to be done, they said the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay, so if someone has his work cut out for him, it means that he has a lot of work to do.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's right.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can also say this to someone that you're talking to.

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So Marco, Marco's writing a book, and I say, hey, Marco, that's a really long book you're writing.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It looks like you really have your work cut out for you.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's right.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Or maybe this project is really difficult.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I really have my work cut out.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mm-hmm.

128
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, so you're basically saying I have a very hard time ahead of me.

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Mm-hmm.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay, so that's all the phrases we have for you.

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why don't we have a listen to our dialogue one last time?

132
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The air conditioning is not working.

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Dan is on top of that.

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That would be convenient.

137
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The circuit breakers keep going out all the time.

139
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's really annoying.

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, you're right.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This office is falling apart.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged, and that's why the parking lot was flooded.

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I know.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I was in ankle-deep water trying to get to my car that day.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So a handyman is also commonly referred to as a jack of all trades.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right.

148
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So these are both kind of funny words.

149
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
First of all, handy as an adjective means useful or helpful.

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So maybe a hammer is a handy tool.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a very handy tool.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I find my iPhone has some very handy applications.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can use the dictionary.

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So a handyman is someone who's helpful.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He can do many things.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But a jack of all trades is very special because it means he is a person that can do basically any job.

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So sometimes in offices, people may have someone that they may refer to as a jack of all trades.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So he may fix the computers.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He also knows a little bit about marketing and does many odd and random things around the office.

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's right.

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You could say, my friend Paul, he's a jack of all trades.

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He can fix a car.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He can cook.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He can fix a door or a window, but he can also sew.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So he's a jack of all trades.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He has many, many skills.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's right.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And talking about these skills, being a handyman is not a profession per se.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's actually a trade.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And so we say this because it's something that you normally do with your hands.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And you don't have to go to university to study it.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You maybe have an apprenticeship where you study by working.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And it's one of a few very, very important trades, like being a plumber or an electrician.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But a handyman is more general.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Like we said, you can do many different things.

177
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's right.

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So very interesting.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There are many trades out there.

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Maybe you can come on the site and mention some of these that you may know, like, for example, a very well-known trade is a cobbler, a person that makes shoes, right?

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Makes shoes or fixes shoes.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's a very weird word, though, because shoes and cobbler don't seem to have much to do with each other.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, many, many, many trades like this.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I know before, they used to be blacksmiths, right?

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So many types of trades.

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000

188

Bye, everyone.
