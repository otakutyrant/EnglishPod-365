00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Katherine, and we've got a very sad dialogue today, actually, Marco.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we have a very sad but interesting dialogue of something that happens all the time.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Maybe you have a girlfriend, maybe you had a boyfriend, and you break up.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That means you are no longer boyfriend and girlfriend.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, I think I'll pass.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mark broke up with me.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I feel awful.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What happened?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't know what I did wrong.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's so cliche.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You deserve so much better.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when we both had some time off.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think he found someone else.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a co-worker.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Whatever, he's a jerk.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Forget about him.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There are many more fish in the sea.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But you're right.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's no use for me to sulk around.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let's go out tonight.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So obviously this girl, Lydia, is very torn.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She's very sad because her boyfriend broke up with her.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She's crying the whole time this dialogue was going on.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But she did mention, her and her friend mentioned some interesting things.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why don't we take a look at some of the words they used on language takeaway?

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Language takeaway.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So first of all, her friend says, hey, do you want to go out tonight?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And what does Lydia say?

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She says, no, I think I'll pass.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All right.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I think I'll pass.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will pass.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So what does this verb mean, to pass?

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So that means she is politely rejecting the offer or the invitation.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So no thanks.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No thanks.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's basically what it means.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I won't go.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So hey, Marco, you want to go see a movie in a couple hours?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, I think I'll pass.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I got homework to do.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All right.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So Marco will not come.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That means to decline an invitation.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So that's what it means to pass.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now, as they continue to talk, they mentioned some of the problems with their boyfriend, but Maggie said, ugh, that's so cliche.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So the boyfriend said something, and Maggie thinks that what he said was very, very cliche.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So what is something that is cliche?

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Cliche means something that is said or done very often.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's almost like we would expect it.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So like, for example, what's a cliche phrase or a cliche action?

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, in the dialogue, they were talking about ways of breaking up with people.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So for example, it's not you, it's me.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's break up.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So that's a cliche because it's a sentence, it's a phrase everyone always says.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not very, maybe not very honest.

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Or like a movie cliche would be, you know, a couple, they're getting married, but their parents, the parents of the bride, they're divorced, they hate each other.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But then at the wedding, they get back together, they're going to get married again.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's a cliche story.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Because you've heard it before.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
All the time.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's very common.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So something that's very common, something that you would expect, that's almost, that's a cliche.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And a cliche, calling something a cliche is not a good thing.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's usually a bad thing.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay.

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So Maggie goes on to say that, you know, this guy, Mark, her ex-boyfriend, he's not really worth it.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She says, you deserve so much better.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So to deserve is a verb and it means that you should receive something or you should expect something.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So almost like, you know, in this case, you deserve better.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have earned something better.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're a good person.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And you should receive a, you know, you should have a good boyfriend.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So when, when she says you deserve so much better, she's talking about deserving a better guy, a better man.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Or for example, so Marco, you work so hard at school, you're always doing your homework.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You really deserve good grades.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You should receive good grades.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Very good.

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now, when Lydia said, yeah, you know what, I just thought we were having some problems and we had hit a rough patch.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So she's talking about a rough patch.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is that?

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A rough patch is actually something we talk about a lot in spoken English.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a way to describe a period of time.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So maybe a week or a month when things are difficult, you know, when maybe you argue with your boyfriend or girlfriend or when you're sad a lot or when you're confused.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And so a period of time when you're angry or sad with your boyfriend or girlfriend, and that's a rough patch.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So maybe we can apply a rough patch to another situation, like at work.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Maybe you're going through a rough patch at work.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That means I'm always busy, I'm always tired, I don't feel happy with my job.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going through a rough patch.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So it's usually a temporary period of time where things are going bad.

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It could be, it could be a week, it could be a month, it could be a year, but it's a, it's a fixed amount of time.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not forever.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Right.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's just a period.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, very good.

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And Lydia went on to say that, you know, she thought that maybe he was going out with someone else and she was suspicious because she was, he was spending a lot of time with some other girl.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, so to be suspicious is to think that something is happening, but you don't know.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So for example, Marco, I think you've been taking the milk from the kitchen.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are always drinking coffee and you always take milk in your coffee and there's no more milk.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I think it was you.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mm hmm.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm being suspicious.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm thinking that maybe you did something bad or wrong, that I'm guilty.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So maybe you're suspicious that someone is stealing the milk or maybe, um, you suspect or you're suspicious that your next door neighbor is maybe a car thief, right?

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you're very suspicious.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That means you're always thinking that this person or someone else is doing something bad.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So a lot of words there talking about relationships, talking about cliches.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why don't we go back?

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hello?

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, I think I'll pass.

136
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mark broke up with me.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I feel awful.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What happened?

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know what I did wrong.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's so cliche.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You deserve so much better.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when we both had some time off.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think he found someone else.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Whatever.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He's a jerk.

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Forget about him.

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There are many more fish in the sea.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But you're right.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There's no use for me to sulk around.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's go out tonight.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of those phrases on Fluency Builder.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
All right, so, Marco, these are cliche phrases that we hear in English.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
When people are breaking up, okay, so there's some breaking up phrases, but there's also phrases that you might hear from your friend after you have a breakup, okay?

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The first phrase we're going to look at, I think, is to need space.

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, he said he needed some space.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Right, and that's a cliche phrase, as we said, but it means that maybe her ex-boyfriend or Mark needs more space, needs more time to be on his own or needs more time to do his own things.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So when you're in a relationship, you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you're always together.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I need some space means I want to be alone.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't want to be with my boyfriend or girlfriend.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Sometimes this is just a small period, sometimes it's forever.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It depends.

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's right.

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So when somebody says that they need space, it means they need a little bit of more time to be on their own or to be alone, as you said.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And also, he had also given her another cliche phrase, Mark said that she is not the one for him.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay, so the emphasis here is the one.

174
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The one.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She's not the one for him.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So in English, we often talk about the one, and this means the person that you will marry, the love of your life.

177
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Your significant other, your other half.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's right.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And so you hope that you will marry the one.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But her boyfriend realized, he said, listen, I like you, but you're not the one.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're not the person that I will marry.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So this is a phrase you often hear in breakup.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So if you're single, maybe you don't have a boyfriend or you're not married, you might say that you haven't found the one.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Or yeah, you have a lot of different boyfriends, but you still haven't found the one.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That means the one you will marry.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's right.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, very good.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And now towards the end of the dialogue, Maggie also gives her some advice and said, you know what?

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Forget about him.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There are many more fish in the sea.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Okay, so this is a phrase that we often say when we're trying to make somebody feel better.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So the person is sad and we want to make them happy.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And so there are many more fish in the sea means that there are other men in the world.

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay, you're sad.

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You broke up.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I understand.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But there are so many other men you could date.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So she's trying to say, hey, listen, look at this world.

199
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There's so many different options.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's right.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So it's the similarity of how in the sea you have so many fish in the world, you have so many men.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So don't worry about it.

203
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And you can say this about women, too.

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So, for example, if I'm talking to my male friend or my brother and my brother just broke up with his girlfriend, I can say, hey, listen, there are many more fish in the sea, many other women.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So don't worry about it.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't worry about it.

207
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You'll be okay.

208
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And Lydia says, you know what?

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I think you're right.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And there's really no use for me to sulk around.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So what does she mean to sulk around?

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
To sulk.

213
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now, this is something that is very visual for me.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I see somebody sulking, their head is low, they're sad.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Someone who is sulking often wears their sweatpants or their pajamas.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
They don't make themselves look good.

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
To sulk around means to be in your house, to be sad, to watch TV and eat ice cream.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So stop sulking.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't look sad.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Be happy.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So to sulk is to act sad and to be very down.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So it's kind of like you're very, it's kind of a combination of being lazy and also sad at the same time because something bad happened to you.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Exactly.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And so we often say that in English, teenagers like to sulk, you know, oh, I'm so angry at my parents.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And your parents will say, hey, stop sulking.

226
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Go study.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's right.

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Very good.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
OK, so a lot of great phrases here.

230
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think we can go back.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hello.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, I think I'll pass.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mark broke up with me.

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I feel awful.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What happened?

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Just last week, you were talking about going on vacation together.

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know what I did wrong.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's so cliche.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You deserve so much better.

245
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when we both had some time off.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think he found someone else.

247
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Whatever.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He's a jerk.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Forget about him.

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There are many more fish in the sea.

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But, you're right.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's no use for me to sulk around.

255
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go out tonight.

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Alright, so talking about breakups, these cliche lines, and well Maggie's obviously upset.

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What other cliche lines or breakup phrases have you heard?

258
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Apart from, it's not you, it's me, you're just not the one.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I need some space.

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I need some space.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think of you more like a friend, you know, because there's like a boyfriend, a girlfriend, but then there's a friend.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And so, listen, I like you, but I think of you more like a friend.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, I think that's a typical one, especially if you're asking someone out on a date, they might say that, you know, oh, I really like you, but I see you more as a friend than anything else.

264
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So there's another one that's very popular.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Sometimes you hear people say, I'm just not ready for a relationship.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And that's also a cliche line.

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Or, I'm not ready to commit.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm not ready to commit.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And it's interesting because I think breaking up is one of the hardest things that people can do.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I think maybe this is why you just use one of these phrases that are so popular and common because I guess it's kind of a good way to explain in very soft terms what you want to say and to break up with someone.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's right.

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And I think that sometimes people are afraid to make the other person sad.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And so they say these things that are very, you know, general like it's not you, it's me.

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But sometimes this makes the other person even more sad because they don't understand why that they're breaking up.

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What about breaking up over the telephone or breaking up with a letter?

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Generally, at least in America, we say that breaking up over email or letter or phone is not a good way to end a relationship.

277
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's very cold.

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's very cold.

279
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So the other person would be very angry if that happened.

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's right.

281
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But you just want to see the person and say, listen, let's have a conversation.

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's talk about this face to face.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:27,000
So this is actually very interesting because as we say, maybe in other countries or in other cultures is not really a negative thing to break up over the phone or maybe send an email saying, you know what, I don't want to see you anymore.

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Right.

285
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So I'd be very curious to hear about you guys and your cultures and what happens when people break up where you live.

286
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So let us know.

287
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We hope to see you there.

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And of course, we hope that you haven't had any very bad makeup experiences.

290
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But if you're comfortable sharing, we'd like to hear about your culture and your background.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,000
All right.

292
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So we'll see you guys there.

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Bye.
