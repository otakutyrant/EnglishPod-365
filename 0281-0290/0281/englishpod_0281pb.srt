00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:03,960
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,179 --> 00:00:08,500
My name is Katherine, and we've got a very sad dialogue today, actually, Marco.

4
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:09,060
That's right.

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,980
Today we have a very sad but interesting dialogue of something that happens all the time.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,960
Maybe you have a girlfriend, maybe you had a boyfriend, and you break up.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,539
That means you are no longer boyfriend and girlfriend.

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,649
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about what's going on.

9
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:35,929
Hello?

10
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,530
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

11
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,609
No, I think I'll pass.

12
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,030
Mark broke up with me.

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,609
I feel awful.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,310
What?

15
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:47,649
What happened?

16
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:51,810
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

17
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,469
I don't know what I did wrong.

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,390
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,170
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,670
That's so cliche.

21
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,450
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,590
You deserve so much better.

23
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:19,049
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when we both had some time off.

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,090
I think he found someone else.

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,950
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a co-worker.

26
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,329
Whatever, he's a jerk.

27
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:30,430
Forget about him.

28
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:32,670
There are many more fish in the sea.

29
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,150
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

30
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:38,170
But you're right.

31
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,629
There's no use for me to sulk around.

32
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:42,629
Let's go out tonight.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,629
All right, we're back.

34
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,730
So obviously this girl, Lydia, is very torn.

35
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,689
She's very sad because her boyfriend broke up with her.

36
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:54,269
That's right.

37
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,510
She's crying the whole time this dialogue was going on.

38
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,170
That's right.

39
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,689
But she did mention, her and her friend mentioned some interesting things.

40
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,049
Why don't we take a look at some of the words they used on language takeaway?

41
00:02:08,409 --> 00:02:09,210
Language takeaway.

42
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,949
So first of all, her friend says, hey, do you want to go out tonight?

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,289
And what does Lydia say?

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,969
She says, no, I think I'll pass.

45
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:19,949
All right.

46
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:21,490
But I think I'll pass.

47
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:22,569
I will pass.

48
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,830
So what does this verb mean, to pass?

49
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,469
So that means she is politely rejecting the offer or the invitation.

50
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,969
So no thanks.

51
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:31,729
No thanks.

52
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,689
That's basically what it means.

53
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:33,270
I won't go.

54
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,650
So hey, Marco, you want to go see a movie in a couple hours?

55
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,969
No, I think I'll pass.

56
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,969
I got homework to do.

57
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:39,430
All right.

58
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,129
So Marco will not come.

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,949
That means to decline an invitation.

60
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,810
That's right.

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,610
So that's what it means to pass.

62
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:55,289
Now, as they continue to talk, they mentioned some of the problems with their boyfriend, but Maggie said, ugh, that's so cliche.

63
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:00,669
So the boyfriend said something, and Maggie thinks that what he said was very, very cliche.

64
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,550
So what is something that is cliche?

65
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:08,590
Cliche means something that is said or done very often.

66
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:10,469
It's almost like we would expect it.

67
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:16,370
So like, for example, what's a cliche phrase or a cliche action?

68
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,289
Well, in the dialogue, they were talking about ways of breaking up with people.

69
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,610
So for example, it's not you, it's me.

70
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:25,990
Let's break up.

71
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,930
So that's a cliche because it's a sentence, it's a phrase everyone always says.

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,530
It's not very, maybe not very honest.

73
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:43,909
Or like a movie cliche would be, you know, a couple, they're getting married, but their parents, the parents of the bride, they're divorced, they hate each other.

74
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,069
But then at the wedding, they get back together, they're going to get married again.

75
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:51,210
That's a cliche story.

76
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:51,770
That's right.

77
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,090
Because you've heard it before.

78
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,129
All the time.

79
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,050
It's very common.

80
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,969
So something that's very common, something that you would expect, that's almost, that's a cliche.

81
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:02,770
And a cliche, calling something a cliche is not a good thing.

82
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,789
It's usually a bad thing.

83
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:04,289
That's right.

84
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:04,949
Okay.

85
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:12,030
So Maggie goes on to say that, you know, this guy, Mark, her ex-boyfriend, he's not really worth it.

86
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:14,289
She says, you deserve so much better.

87
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,150
Okay.

88
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:22,509
So to deserve is a verb and it means that you should receive something or you should expect something.

89
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,649
So almost like, you know, in this case, you deserve better.

90
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,350
You have earned something better.

91
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,410
You're a good person.

92
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,589
And you should receive a, you know, you should have a good boyfriend.

93
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,129
That's right.

94
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:41,050
So when, when she says you deserve so much better, she's talking about deserving a better guy, a better man.

95
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:46,149
Or for example, so Marco, you work so hard at school, you're always doing your homework.

96
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:48,649
You really deserve good grades.

97
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,970
You should receive good grades.

98
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:51,689
Very good.

99
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:00,250
Now, when Lydia said, yeah, you know what, I just thought we were having some problems and we had hit a rough patch.

100
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,490
So she's talking about a rough patch.

101
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:03,069
What is that?

102
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,769
A rough patch is actually something we talk about a lot in spoken English.

103
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,769
It's a way to describe a period of time.

104
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:21,069
So maybe a week or a month when things are difficult, you know, when maybe you argue with your boyfriend or girlfriend or when you're sad a lot or when you're confused.

105
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:27,490
And so a period of time when you're angry or sad with your boyfriend or girlfriend, and that's a rough patch.

106
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,709
So maybe we can apply a rough patch to another situation, like at work.

107
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,610
Maybe you're going through a rough patch at work.

108
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,870
That means I'm always busy, I'm always tired, I don't feel happy with my job.

109
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,089
I'm going through a rough patch.

110
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,029
So it's usually a temporary period of time where things are going bad.

111
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,949
It could be, it could be a week, it could be a month, it could be a year, but it's a, it's a fixed amount of time.

112
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,709
It's not forever.

113
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,050
Right.

114
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,850
It's just a period.

115
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:53,209
Okay, very good.

116
00:05:53,829 --> 00:06:06,129
And Lydia went on to say that, you know, she thought that maybe he was going out with someone else and she was suspicious because she was, he was spending a lot of time with some other girl.

117
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:12,490
Okay, so to be suspicious is to think that something is happening, but you don't know.

118
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:17,269
So for example, Marco, I think you've been taking the milk from the kitchen.

119
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:22,290
You are always drinking coffee and you always take milk in your coffee and there's no more milk.

120
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,689
So I think it was you.

121
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,110
Mm hmm.

122
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,370
I'm being suspicious.

123
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,230
I'm thinking that maybe you did something bad or wrong, that I'm guilty.

124
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:40,569
So maybe you're suspicious that someone is stealing the milk or maybe, um, you suspect or you're suspicious that your next door neighbor is maybe a car thief, right?

125
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:41,970
So you're very suspicious.

126
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,810
That means you're always thinking that this person or someone else is doing something bad.

127
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:47,829
That's right.

128
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,550
Okay.

129
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,649
Okay.

130
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,649
So a lot of words there talking about relationships, talking about cliches.

131
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:53,870
Why don't we go back?

132
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:57,069
Let's listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

133
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,329
Hello?

134
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,029
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

135
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,069
No, I think I'll pass.

136
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,470
Mark broke up with me.

137
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:15,069
I feel awful.

138
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:15,810
What?

139
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,129
What happened?

140
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,329
Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together.

141
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,889
I don't know what I did wrong.

142
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,810
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

143
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:33,589
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

144
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,149
That's so cliche.

145
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,889
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

146
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,029
You deserve so much better.

147
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,509
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when we both had some time off.

148
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,509
I think he found someone else.

149
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,550
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker.

150
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:57,589
Whatever.

151
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:58,769
He's a jerk.

152
00:07:59,149 --> 00:07:59,870
Forget about him.

153
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,129
There are many more fish in the sea.

154
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,589
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

155
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:07,610
But you're right.

156
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,050
There's no use for me to sulk around.

157
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,949
Let's go out tonight.

158
00:08:15,649 --> 00:08:20,329
All right, we're back, so now let's take a look at some of those phrases on Fluency Builder.

159
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,410
All right, so, Marco, these are cliche phrases that we hear in English.

160
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:37,350
When people are breaking up, okay, so there's some breaking up phrases, but there's also phrases that you might hear from your friend after you have a breakup, okay?

161
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,330
The first phrase we're going to look at, I think, is to need space.

162
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,330
So, he said he needed some space.

163
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:58,149
Right, and that's a cliche phrase, as we said, but it means that maybe her ex-boyfriend or Mark needs more space, needs more time to be on his own or needs more time to do his own things.

164
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:58,889
That's right.

165
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,289
So when you're in a relationship, you have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, you're always together.

166
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,610
I need some space means I want to be alone.

167
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:09,289
I don't want to be with my boyfriend or girlfriend.

168
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:12,330
Sometimes this is just a small period, sometimes it's forever.

169
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,370
It depends.

170
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,029
That's right.

171
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,750
So when somebody says that they need space, it means they need a little bit of more time to be on their own or to be alone, as you said.

172
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:28,950
And also, he had also given her another cliche phrase, Mark said that she is not the one for him.

173
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,370
Okay, so the emphasis here is the one.

174
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,029
The one.

175
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,049
She's not the one for him.

176
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:41,649
So in English, we often talk about the one, and this means the person that you will marry, the love of your life.

177
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,509
Your significant other, your other half.

178
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,269
That's right.

179
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,909
And so you hope that you will marry the one.

180
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,570
But her boyfriend realized, he said, listen, I like you, but you're not the one.

181
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,669
You're not the person that I will marry.

182
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,789
So this is a phrase you often hear in breakup.

183
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,090
So if you're single, maybe you don't have a boyfriend or you're not married, you might say that you haven't found the one.

184
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:09,350
Or yeah, you have a lot of different boyfriends, but you still haven't found the one.

185
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,110
That means the one you will marry.

186
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:11,809
That's right.

187
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:12,850
Okay, very good.

188
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:18,429
And now towards the end of the dialogue, Maggie also gives her some advice and said, you know what?

189
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,570
Forget about him.

190
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:21,809
There are many more fish in the sea.

191
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,649
Okay, so this is a phrase that we often say when we're trying to make somebody feel better.

192
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,610
So the person is sad and we want to make them happy.

193
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:36,289
And so there are many more fish in the sea means that there are other men in the world.

194
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,330
Okay, you're sad.

195
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,009
You broke up.

196
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,789
I understand.

197
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,830
But there are so many other men you could date.

198
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,350
So she's trying to say, hey, listen, look at this world.

199
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:44,730
There's so many different options.

200
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:45,309
That's right.

201
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:51,070
So it's the similarity of how in the sea you have so many fish in the world, you have so many men.

202
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,169
So don't worry about it.

203
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,629
And you can say this about women, too.

204
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:04,169
So, for example, if I'm talking to my male friend or my brother and my brother just broke up with his girlfriend, I can say, hey, listen, there are many more fish in the sea, many other women.

205
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,570
So don't worry about it.

206
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:06,429
Don't worry about it.

207
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,029
You'll be okay.

208
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,629
And Lydia says, you know what?

209
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,549
I think you're right.

210
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,850
And there's really no use for me to sulk around.

211
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,629
So what does she mean to sulk around?

212
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:15,549
To sulk.

213
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,789
Now, this is something that is very visual for me.

214
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,809
I see somebody sulking, their head is low, they're sad.

215
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,649
Someone who is sulking often wears their sweatpants or their pajamas.

216
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,690
They don't make themselves look good.

217
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,730
To sulk around means to be in your house, to be sad, to watch TV and eat ice cream.

218
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,049
So stop sulking.

219
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,830
Don't look sad.

220
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,450
Be happy.

221
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,929
So to sulk is to act sad and to be very down.

222
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:51,190
So it's kind of like you're very, it's kind of a combination of being lazy and also sad at the same time because something bad happened to you.

223
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:51,830
Exactly.

224
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:58,850
And so we often say that in English, teenagers like to sulk, you know, oh, I'm so angry at my parents.

225
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,490
And your parents will say, hey, stop sulking.

226
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,129
Go study.

227
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:02,649
That's right.

228
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,389
Very good.

229
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,750
OK, so a lot of great phrases here.

230
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,750
I think we can go back.

231
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,090
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

232
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,169
Hello.

233
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,750
Hey, do you want to go out tonight?

234
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,850
No, I think I'll pass.

235
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,210
Mark broke up with me.

236
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,850
I feel awful.

237
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,830
What happened?

238
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,029
Just last week, you were talking about going on vacation together.

239
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:35,649
I don't know what I did wrong.

240
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,570
He said he needed some space to figure things out.

241
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,350
He said I didn't do anything wrong, that I'm a great person, just not the one for him.

242
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:47,889
That's so cliche.

243
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,649
Mark's not worth your time, Lydia.

244
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,789
You deserve so much better.

245
00:12:53,769 --> 00:13:00,269
I know we had hit a rough patch, but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend when we both had some time off.

246
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:03,309
I think he found someone else.

247
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,289
I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker.

248
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,330
Whatever.

249
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,529
He's a jerk.

250
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:11,629
Forget about him.

251
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:13,870
There are many more fish in the sea.

252
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,409
Talk about being cliche, Maggie.

253
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,330
But, you're right.

254
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,850
There's no use for me to sulk around.

255
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:23,769
Let's go out tonight.

256
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:34,169
Alright, so talking about breakups, these cliche lines, and well Maggie's obviously upset.

257
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:37,610
What other cliche lines or breakup phrases have you heard?

258
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,330
Apart from, it's not you, it's me, you're just not the one.

259
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:43,570
I need some space.

260
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,750
I need some space.

261
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,909
I think of you more like a friend, you know, because there's like a boyfriend, a girlfriend, but then there's a friend.

262
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,210
And so, listen, I like you, but I think of you more like a friend.

263
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:03,750
Yeah, I think that's a typical one, especially if you're asking someone out on a date, they might say that, you know, oh, I really like you, but I see you more as a friend than anything else.

264
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,629
So there's another one that's very popular.

265
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:10,289
Sometimes you hear people say, I'm just not ready for a relationship.

266
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,610
And that's also a cliche line.

267
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,009
Or, I'm not ready to commit.

268
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:15,169
I'm not ready to commit.

269
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,450
And it's interesting because I think breaking up is one of the hardest things that people can do.

270
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:32,629
And I think maybe this is why you just use one of these phrases that are so popular and common because I guess it's kind of a good way to explain in very soft terms what you want to say and to break up with someone.

271
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,070
That's right.

272
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:36,590
And I think that sometimes people are afraid to make the other person sad.

273
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,750
And so they say these things that are very, you know, general like it's not you, it's me.

274
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:48,110
But sometimes this makes the other person even more sad because they don't understand why that they're breaking up.

275
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:52,490
What about breaking up over the telephone or breaking up with a letter?

276
00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:03,090
Generally, at least in America, we say that breaking up over email or letter or phone is not a good way to end a relationship.

277
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,049
It's very cold.

278
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:04,789
It's very cold.

279
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,429
So the other person would be very angry if that happened.

280
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:08,889
That's right.

281
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,070
But you just want to see the person and say, listen, let's have a conversation.

282
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:14,070
Let's talk about this face to face.

283
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:27,929
So this is actually very interesting because as we say, maybe in other countries or in other cultures is not really a negative thing to break up over the phone or maybe send an email saying, you know what, I don't want to see you anymore.

284
00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:28,570
Right.

285
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:34,610
So I'd be very curious to hear about you guys and your cultures and what happens when people break up where you live.

286
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,690
So let us know.

287
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,549
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

288
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:38,669
We hope to see you there.

289
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,669
And of course, we hope that you haven't had any very bad makeup experiences.

290
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,950
But if you're comfortable sharing, we'd like to hear about your culture and your background.

291
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:45,490
All right.

292
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,350
So we'll see you guys there.

293
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,669
Bye.
