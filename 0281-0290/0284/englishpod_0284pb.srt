00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,299
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,400
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,259
And today we have an intermediate level lesson for you that's kind of about cars, right?

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:09,839
That's right.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,039
So today we are taking our car to the mechanic, and we're just going to check things and make sure that our car is okay.

7
00:00:17,899 --> 00:00:18,079
All right.

8
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:23,760
So we're going to learn a lot of really great words that have to do with cars and what happens when cars break down.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,559
So let's listen to our dialogue.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,920
Welcome to Al's garage.

11
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,579
What seems to be the problem?

12
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,100
No problem at all.

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,579
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,100
Very wise decision.

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,539
When was the last time you had a tune up?

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Not that long ago.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,920
I think it was four months ago.

18
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:56,060
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:56,960
Why?

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,700
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

21
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,280
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

22
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:12,659
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster, and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.

23
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,000
I see.

24
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:15,140
What else?

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,939
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

26
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,859
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
Okay, well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,140
Trust me.

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
Regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.

30
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,099
Alright, we're back.

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:49,120
So a very simple dialogue with the mechanic explaining to the client about why you need to take care of your car.

32
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,400
So he mentioned a couple of very technical words in here.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,840
Let's take a look at those on Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:03,079
The first phrase we're looking at today is tune up.

35
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,039
So a tune up is a thing, it's a noun, and it's something you do to check your car.

36
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,219
Right, so you take your car for a tune up, or you get a tune up.

37
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:23,280
Now this is for your car, and this basically means to check that your car is okay and replace any very easy things around the car.

38
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,840
So you don't normally get a tune up when your car is broken.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,719
You get a tune up when your car is okay.

40
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,099
That's right, that's right.

41
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,259
So the mechanic explained some of the things that you do when you get a tune up.

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,180
So for example, he said that they change the motor oil.

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,979
Okay, so like it sounds, motor oil is oil for your motor.

44
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,659
That's right.

45
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:52,240
But there are other kinds of oil as well, and the oil is oftentimes put into the car, and then sometimes it falls out.

46
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:55,419
And so what's that thing that catches the oil when it comes down?

47
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,599
It's called an oil pan, an oil pan.

48
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:00,020
So yes, as you say, there are different types of oils.

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,939
Cooking oil is obviously for cooking, for eating.

50
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,039
But motor oil is not for eating, it's for your motor.

51
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,379
But we also have to change the oil filter.

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,800
Now this is an important part that often gets mentioned at tune ups.

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,580
That's right.

54
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,120
So the word filter here, you have the verb to filter.

55
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,759
In this case, we also have a noun called a filter.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:33,379
So what this device does, it collects maybe dirt or rocks and dust or anything that you don't want to be in your engine, and specifically maybe if the oil is a little bit dirty.

57
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,099
Right, so an oil filter.

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,400
Make sure that the oil in your motor is not going to harm your motor.

59
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,860
And we also have a couple of interesting things like the fuel filter.

60
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,400
Now how is this different from the oil filter?

61
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,180
It's pretty much the same thing.

62
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:55,639
The only difference is that this filter specifically cleans the gasoline in your car.

63
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,020
Okay, similar object.

64
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,460
After that, though, we have something very different.

65
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,840
These are spark plugs.

66
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:01,719
That's right.

67
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:06,000
These are small little devices that, as the name says, create a spark.

68
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,539
This is how your engine goes.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,659
This is how your car moves.

70
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,180
You have a spark and then everything starts running.

71
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:13,860
Spark plugs are actually quite important, right?

72
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,520
That's right.

73
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,680
So a spark is a very quick flash of light that comes out.

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,560
That's right.

75
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,600
It's not a long light.

76
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,519
It's just a spark.

77
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,279
So maybe when I strike a match or I use a lighter, there's a spark and that's what starts the fire.

78
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,139
That's right.

79
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,120
That's exactly right.

80
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,879
So a spark plug.

81
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:40,279
And now we also check the oil levels of our car and that's a very important thing as well.

82
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,180
Yeah, that's right.

83
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:49,319
So the oil level is something that you test with a long stick and you put it into the engine, the oil container, and make sure that there is enough oil.

84
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:53,079
Because if there's not enough oil, you can have very serious car trouble.

85
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,000
That's right.

86
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,680
So a lot of technical or mechanical things that we're taking a look at.

87
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,699
Why don't we go back, let's review all these words and we'll be back in a bit.

88
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:33,279
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

89
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:34,160
Why?

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,899
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,480
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

92
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:45,800
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster.

93
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,839
And that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.

94
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,220
I see.

95
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,319
What else?

96
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,199
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

97
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,040
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

98
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

99
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,399
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

100
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,319
Trust me.

101
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,759
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.

102
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:19,360
All right, we're back.

103
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,860
So now we've prepared three key phrases for you.

104
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:24,180
Let's take a look at those now on Fluency Builder.

105
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:36,040
This first phrase is something that you often hear in the service industry, so anytime you're going to a shop or maybe in this case a mechanic.

106
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,439
The mechanic will say to you, what seems to be the problem?

107
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:40,240
That's right.

108
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:41,399
So this is a question.

109
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,000
And we're saying, what is wrong with your car?

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,339
Or maybe if you go to the doctor, the doctor will say, what seems to be the problem?

111
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,240
What seems to be the problem?

112
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:50,800
This means, what's wrong with you?

113
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,339
Where do you have a problem?

114
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,519
This is a very, very common phrase.

115
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,360
So remember this one.

116
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,980
It just means, what's going on?

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,620
Why are you here?

118
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,199
What can I help you with?

119
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,540
It's very polite though, right?

120
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,199
It's better than saying, what's wrong with you?

121
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:02,759
No, yeah.

122
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,220
You wouldn't want to say, what's wrong with you?

123
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:04,920
That's very rude.

124
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,660
So what seems to be the problem is a much more polite way of saying things.

125
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,319
Very good.

126
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:19,079
And well, the mechanic, after explaining everything, he said that doing all these things, changing the filters, will keep the car running smoothly.

127
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,279
Okay, so we're not talking about running like a marathon here.

128
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,779
We're talking about using your car.

129
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,879
And so when we turn a car on, we don't say that the car is operating really.

130
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:31,819
We say it's running.

131
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,500
So that means that it's in use, that I've turned the key and the motor is running.

132
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,980
But if it's running well, we say it's running smoothly.

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,139
So it's not having any problems.

134
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, so if you turn your car on and you hear your engine, it sounds very normal.

135
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,319
No problems.

136
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,620
It's running smoothly.

137
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,759
If it's going, it's not running smoothly.

138
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,360
That's right.

139
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,199
And obviously, if you don't take care of your car, what may happen is you may suffer a breakdown.

140
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,839
Okay, remember this phrase as a phrase, because obviously things can break.

141
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,560
I broke a glass.

142
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:15,319
But as far as cars are concerned, you say a car breaks down, or I want to avoid breakdowns.

143
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,279
And so this is something that happens when your car no longer works properly.

144
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:19,920
That's right.

145
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,740
So you say, my car broke down yesterday.

146
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,279
And I had to call a friend to pick me up, because you know, when your car breaks down, you can't go anywhere.

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,579
Right, you can't drive it anymore.

148
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,639
Very good.

149
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
So to break down.

150
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,779
Now, obviously, if you get a flat tire, that doesn't really mean that your car broke down.

151
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,700
No, a flat tire is a bit different.

152
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,220
That means that you have to replace the tire.

153
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:53,100
But when your car breaks down, it means that something inside the car, like a piece of it, yeah, the transmission or these spark plugs or the engine, some part of it isn't working right, and you have to get it fixed or replaced.

154
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,860
That's right.

155
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:59,419
Okay, so a lot of interesting things, talking about cars here, why don't we take a look at our dialogue again.

156
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,240
Let's listen to it and be back in a bit.

157
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,600
Welcome to Al's Garage.

158
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,299
What seems to be the problem?

159
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,799
No problem at all.

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,259
I am taking a long road trip, and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

161
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,820
Very wise decision.

162
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,279
When was the last time you had a tune up?

163
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,659
Not that long ago.

164
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,659
I think it was four months ago.

165
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,740
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

166
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,679
Why?

167
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,399
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

168
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,980
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

169
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:48,340
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster, and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.

170
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:49,700
I see.

171
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,840
What else?

172
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,620
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels, such as hydraulic fluid.

173
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,519
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

174
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,860
Okay, well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

175
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,399
Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.

176
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:24,240
Okay, so talking about cars and tune ups, now, when we go to the mechanic, you saw that he said, welcome to Al's garage.

177
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,120
So a mechanic shop is usually called a garage.

178
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:32,279
That's right, and as you will know, a garage is a place where we store cars.

179
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:41,539
So sometimes people park their cars in the street, but if you have a special place to protect your car from the rain or the snow, like a room for your car, that's called a garage.

180
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:50,399
And this might be confusing, but a store, like you say, for a mechanic is a garage also because there's a door that opens up the same way.

181
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:57,820
It opens up, not out, and you pull the car inside and then the mechanic can fix the car, and so I think that's why it's a garage.

182
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,779
There's room for many cars inside.

183
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:00,419
That's right.

184
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:05,519
So you take, or if your car is at the mechanic shop, you would say, oh, my car's at the garage.

185
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:06,860
It's getting fixed.

186
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,659
Yeah, that's right, but it's a little bit different from the place where you would buy a car.

187
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:21,940
A place where you would buy a car is a car lot, L-O-T, lot, and that's a place where they have many, many cars outside, like in a big parking lot, that's what we call a lot, and you can pick a car and buy it and test it.

188
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,240
But a place where you fix a car, that's special, that's called a garage or a repair shop.

189
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:44,799
Now something that's very interesting and very common in places like the States and Canada is that there are actually used car lots where you can see many cars that they're used and they're trying to sell, but obviously in many other countries it's not very common to see a used car lot.

190
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,600
Well, I think in America people like to buy new cars, and that means that every couple of years they sell their old car, but that car is still good.

191
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,879
You can still use a car from 2005.

192
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,779
In fact, when I had a car, it was from 1991.

193
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,139
It was 16 years old at the time, and so I could still drive it.

194
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,639
It was a good car, and I think that as long as you can drive it, you can sell it.

195
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:17,500
This is actually another interesting thing about cars in general in places like this, is that there are so many cars, and as you say, people are often buying new cars every year or trading their cars every five years, let's say.

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,419
Used cars are very, very, very inexpensive.

197
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,759
I mean, you can get a car for like $500 sometimes.

198
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:30,240
That's right, and in a lot of cases it doesn't make sense to buy a new car because it's going to be less valuable in one day.

199
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:43,059
But a used car, as long as it doesn't have any problems, like you don't want to buy a car that has faulty spark plugs or whatever, but as long as it runs smoothly, I think that it's a very good investment to buy a used car.

200
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:43,799
Very good.

201
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,179
So it's interesting because in many countries, used cars are actually not that much cheaper.

202
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,480
