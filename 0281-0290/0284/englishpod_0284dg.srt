Welcome to Al's Garage.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What seems to be the problem?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
No problem at all.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Very wise decision.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When was the last time you had a tune-up?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Not that long ago.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think it was four months ago.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Why?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I see.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What else?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Trust me.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.
