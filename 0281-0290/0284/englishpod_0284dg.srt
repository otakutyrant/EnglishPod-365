Welcome to Al's Garage.

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,699
What seems to be the problem?

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,220
No problem at all.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,719
I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,239
Very wise decision.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,660
When was the last time you had a tune-up?

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,039
Not that long ago.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,059
I think it was four months ago.

9
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:31,179
We usually recommend that you bring your car in every 5,000 kilometers.

10
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,079
Why?

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,820
I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,420
First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,719
If you don't do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster.

14
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,780
And that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,140
I see.

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,240
What else?

17
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,060
We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,979
We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:00,920
Okay.

20
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,280
Well, when you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a waste of time and money.

21
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,260
Trust me.

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,060
Regular tune-ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid breakdowns.
