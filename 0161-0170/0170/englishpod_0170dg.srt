00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:08,060
EnglishPod.com Man, I'm freaking out.

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,160
You gotta help me.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,439
Whoa, whoa.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,199
Take it easy.

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:11,839
Relax.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,240
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,480
What's going on?

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,940
I can't go through with this.

9
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:17,980
I just can't.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,300
I'm not ready for marriage.

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,620
What was I thinking?

12
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,559
I'm only 35 years old.

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,760
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,760
Adventure's waiting.

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,100
I can't settle down yet.

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,780
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:36,840
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

18
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,259
I know, I know.

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Let's think this through.

20
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,780
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

21
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:48,899
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,420
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

23
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,020
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

24
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,100
You know deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,579
So cut the crap and do it.

26
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,439
You're right.

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,759
I'm being crazy.

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,179
Okay, I'm ready.

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,280
Let's do this.

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,159
Great.

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,239
That was a close one.

32
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,859
You had me going there for a minute.

33
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,459
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.
