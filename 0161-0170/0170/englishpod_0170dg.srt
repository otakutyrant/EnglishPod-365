00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Man, I'm freaking out.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You gotta help me.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Whoa, whoa.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Take it easy.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Relax.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What's going on?

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I can't go through with this.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I just can't.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not ready for marriage.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What was I thinking?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm only 35 years old.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Adventure's waiting.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I can't settle down yet.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I know, I know.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's think this through.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You know deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So cut the crap and do it.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're right.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm being crazy.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay, I'm ready.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let's do this.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Great.

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That was a close one.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You had me going there for a minute.

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.
