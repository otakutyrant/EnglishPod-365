00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,120
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,780
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,980
And my name is Katherine, and today we're talking about a very important day in a couple's life.

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,480
That's right.

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:20,579
We're going to a wedding, but this time it's not going to be so romantic because actually the groom is having second thoughts about the wedding.

6
00:00:21,019 --> 00:00:26,100
Okay, that means he's nervous, and he's not positive he wants to get married today.

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,539
So Let's jump right into this dialogue, listen to what's going on, and when we come back we'll be talking about some of the words and phrases you've heard.

8
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,959
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:14,019
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

10
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,439
I know, I know.

11
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:17,120
Let's think this through.

12
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:19,939
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,140
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,620
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,200
Second of all, you are just getting cold feet.

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,319
You know deep down inside that you want to marry her.

17
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,799
So cut the crap and do it.

18
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:37,620
You're right.

19
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:38,939
I'm being crazy.

20
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,379
Okay, I'm ready.

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,500
Let's do this.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,379
Great.

23
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:43,000
Phew.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,439
That was a close one.

25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,040
You had me going there for a minute.

26
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,959
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

27
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:55,659
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,239
So almost, he almost didn't get married, but luckily you have a good friend to help you out.

29
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:00,879
Exactly.

30
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:09,240
So this friend really saved the day, made sure that the groom didn't get too nervous and had some really positive words.

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,939
So let's take a listen to some of these marriage words in today's language takeaway.

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,960
Language takeaway.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
All right.

34
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,240
So as you mentioned, we have this word marriage.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,139
Now marriage is the noun form, right, of actually getting married or to be married.

36
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Right.

37
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,620
Marriage is the noun, the word that describes the relationship between two married people.

38
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:32,520
Okay.

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:40,780
And so you have a relationship, maybe you're dating, but once you get married, the thing between you as a man and a woman, that's your marriage.

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,360
Your marriage.

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,060
So you could say, our marriage is in danger.

42
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,819
We need to work on our marriage.

43
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,280
Exactly.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,419
Or we have a happy marriage.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,099
All right.

46
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,719
Okay.

47
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,719
So that's marriage.

48
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,020
Now, if you get married, and this guy, he mentioned a phrase, which was to settle down.

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,560
To settle down.

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,240
This is a very important phrase.

51
00:02:57,699 --> 00:03:03,479
To settle down means to get serious, mature, and to stop living like a child.

52
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,699
It means really to have a house or to start having kids.

53
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,719
It's a time in life.

54
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:11,620
So to settle down is to become more stable, right?

55
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:17,840
As you say, to buy a house, to have a family, to stay in one place and not be so adventurous or stuff like that.

56
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,419
Exactly.

57
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,780
So it's to calm down and to be more fixed in life.

58
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:22,300
All right.

59
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,479
Now, the opposite of this would be to be a bachelor.

60
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:26,479
Right.

61
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,539
So bachelor is a single man, someone who's not married.

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,180
And you often hear this term when we talk about apartments.

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,860
So bachelor pad is an apartment that's specific to a single man.

64
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,439
Usually there's lots of video games and a fancy TV and a pool table.

65
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:45,759
Exactly.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,719
All right.

67
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,919
So bachelor, we had a lesson about this called bachelor party.

68
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:50,300
Right.

69
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,939
Which is a party for a man right before he gets married.

70
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:57,120
And a bachelor is a special word for a man who's not yet married.

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,599
Okay.

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,139
Very good.

73
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,439
And now, as they were talking about not getting married, he said that you can't leave Amy at the altar.

74
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,159
Hmm.

75
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,340
So you often hear this in movies.

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,680
She got left at the altar or you can't leave her at the altar.

77
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,919
This word altar is actually religious.

78
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,319
Altar is the table in a church where the priest does all of his work.

79
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:22,939
All right.

80
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,579
So an altar is a special religious table.

81
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:33,139
So usually two people will stand in front of an altar and get married, right, with the priest who is doing his thing there.

82
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:33,480
Exactly.

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,579
He says, do you, Joe, take Samantha to be your bride, blah, blah, blah.

84
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,139
So that happens at a special place called the altar.

85
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,139
Okay, very good.

86
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,759
It's also common in the normal mass, like on Sundays.

87
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,259
Right.

88
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,220
Okay.

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,139
And for the last word or phrase today, it's to get cold feet.

90
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,759
You're just getting cold feet.

91
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:52,819
Okay.

92
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:58,060
So this is a very funny phrase in English because it doesn't actually mean that your feet are cold.

93
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,160
So cold feet means you're nervous about something.

94
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,079
You might change your mind.

95
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,180
Okay.

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,620
So people often talk about men and women getting cold feet before a wedding.

97
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,060
But you can also relate it to any other situation, not only getting married, right?

98
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:14,879
Yeah.

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,379
For example, I'm going to go jump out of an airplane tomorrow.

100
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,040
Okay.

101
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,079
Fast forward tomorrow.

102
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,100
Oh, no, I have cold feet.

103
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,939
I don't think I want to jump out of an airplane.

104
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:23,519
Okay.

105
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,720
So that's to get cold feet, to have second thoughts or doubts about actually doing something.

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,360
Exactly.

107
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:29,100
Cold feet.

108
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:29,759
All right.

109
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,019
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

110
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,699
Let's keep a lookout for all of these words and we'll be back in a little bit.

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,439
Man, I'm freaking out.

112
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,540
You got to help me.

113
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,839
Whoa, whoa.

114
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:44,600
Take it easy.

115
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:45,220
Relax.

116
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:47,639
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

117
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:48,860
What's going on?

118
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,319
I can't go through with this.

119
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,399
I just can't.

120
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,699
I'm not ready for marriage.

121
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,019
What was I thinking?

122
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,959
I'm only 35 years old.

123
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,139
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

124
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,160
Adventure's waiting.

125
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,480
I can't settle down yet.

126
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,180
What are you talking about?

127
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,220
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

128
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,000
I know.

129
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,620
I know.

130
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,360
Let's think this through.

131
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,139
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

132
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:22,319
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

133
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,860
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

134
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,420
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

135
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,519
You know deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

136
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,980
So cut the crap and do it.

137
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:33,819
You're right.

138
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,139
I'm being crazy.

139
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,579
Okay, I'm ready.

140
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,660
Let's do this.

141
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:38,540
Great.

142
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:39,199
Phew.

143
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,620
That was a close one.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,259
You had me going there for a minute.

145
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,860
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

146
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,160
All right, we're back.

147
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,120
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases that we found in this dialogue on Fluency Builder.

148
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:02,439
Fluency Builder This first one is a really great phrase because it's very...

149
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,420
Well, it's easy to picture this, what we're describing.

150
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,079
Sweating like a pig.

151
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,360
To sweat like a pig.

152
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,180
Okay, you are sweating like a pig.

153
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,980
All right, this is a way to say that someone is sweating a lot.

154
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,519
A lot.

155
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,519
Okay, and it's really gross or disgusting.

156
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,100
Now, do pigs actually sweat?

157
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:28,120
I don't know if pigs actually sweat, but you imagine someone smells bad and they have, you know, sweat on their face and their back and their arms.

158
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,319
All right, well sometimes don't you say you're sweating like a dog?

159
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,620
You could also say that.

160
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:40,860
I guess we like animals in English, but this is just a really great way to say that someone is really sweaty.

161
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,540
All right.

162
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,779
And, well, he was sweating and he was really nervous because he said, I can't go through with this.

163
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,399
What does he mean, go through with this?

164
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,819
With what?

165
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
To go through with means to actually do something, okay?

166
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,000
So maybe I say, I don't want to jump out of an airplane.

167
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,600
I can't go through with this.

168
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,139
I can't jump.

169
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,459
So it depends on what we're actually talking about.

170
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,180
If we're talking about a wedding, you say, I can't go through with this.

171
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,660
I can't get married.

172
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,759
So if you're planning a robbery, you say, well, in the last minute, I couldn't go through with it.

173
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:13,519
I backed out.

174
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,319
I can't complete what I talked about doing.

175
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,199
Okay, and now the friend, he finally gets kind of angry and he says, cut the crap.

176
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,240
Oh, man, this is a very common phrase.

177
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:24,639
All right.

178
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,699
Someone says this if they don't want to listen to you complain anymore, okay?

179
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,920
Marco, cut the crap, okay?

180
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,740
I don't want to hear your excuses.

181
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,679
I don't want to hear your complaints.

182
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,279
I want to just hear solutions, solutions, ideas, positive things.

183
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,759
So to cut the crap is no more complaints, no more excuses, or no more talking nonsense.

184
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,220
Exactly, and this is common among teachers and, well, parents.

185
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,799
All right, so cut the crap.

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,820
Now, it's not very polite, right?

187
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,740
So you wouldn't really say it to your boss or like a friend.

188
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:06,639
Cut the crap is kind of rude, and it's a very spoken language, so I wouldn't write it down, and I would not use this with someone who is like a teacher, well...

189
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,659
Yeah, like an authority.

190
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,960
You don't use it with them.

191
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
They might use it with you.

192
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:18,019
Okay, and for our last phrase, he said, you had me going there for a while, or you had me going there for a minute.

193
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,740
Okay, so this is a really interesting phrase.

194
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:30,659
We use this a lot in English, but it's not clear from listening to it what it might mean, so you had me going there, and this sense means, oh, I was really nervous for a minute.

195
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,580
I really believed what you were saying.

196
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,259
Exactly, so maybe we could give an example, Marco.

197
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:35,799
All right.

198
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,500
Did you know that yesterday I won the lottery?

199
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,659
I mean, I won like a million dollars, and I had the perfect numbers.

200
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,580
Oh, my God, really?

201
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,700
Can I have a million dollars?

202
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,080
I would love to help you out, ma'am, but yeah, no, I didn't actually win a million dollars.

203
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,419
You had me going there for a minute.

204
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:53,399
You believed me.

205
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,500
You believed me.

206
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:55,740
Okay, maybe not.

207
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,600
He's not that gullible.

208
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,899
All right, but that's what it means, right?

209
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,419
To believe someone's story or to think that something's going to happen even though it doesn't.

210
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,779
You had me going there.

211
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,700
That means what you thought was going to happen didn't happen.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,200
So you can use it in the third person as like, yeah, I was telling him this awesome story, and I really had him going for a while.

213
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,340
He really believed me, and then I told him it wasn't true.

214
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:21,220
Okay, great phrases.

215
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,139
Now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more about getting cold feet.

216
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,220
Man, I'm freaking out.

217
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,320
You've got to help me.

218
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,379
Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

219
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,019
Relax.

220
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,399
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

221
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,639
What's going on?

222
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,100
I can't go through with this.

223
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,139
I just can't.

224
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm not ready for marriage.

225
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,779
What was I thinking?

226
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm only 35 years old.

227
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,899
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

228
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,899
Adventure's waiting.

229
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,259
I can't settle down yet.

230
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,940
What are you talking about?

231
00:10:57,379 --> 00:11:05,000
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

232
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,419
I know, I know.

233
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,120
Let's think this through.

234
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,940
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

235
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,080
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

236
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,580
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

237
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:23,179
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

238
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,279
You know, deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

239
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,759
So cut the crap and do it.

240
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,620
You're right.

241
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,919
I'm being crazy.

242
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,340
Okay, I'm ready.

243
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,440
Let's do this.

244
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:33,340
Great.

245
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:33,980
Whew.

246
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,399
That was a close one.

247
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,039
You had me going there for a minute.

248
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:39,639
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

249
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:49,659
Alright, so this is a popular scenario, right?

250
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Somebody on their wedding day, they get cold feet and they back out.

251
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,000
TV, movies, books, everyone loves the situation.

252
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:06,200
Have you ever actually heard of or experienced or maybe known of somebody who actually left the bride at the altar or the groom at the altar?

253
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,559
I don't know anyone who did that.

254
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,899
Luckily, I think it's really sad.

255
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,419
Yeah, me neither.

256
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,860
I don't think it's really that common.

257
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:26,820
No, but there was a movie just about this so there's a woman, Julia Roberts, who tries and tries and tries to get married but never can so it's called Runaway Bride because every time she goes to the altar she gets nervous, she gets cold feet and she runs away.

258
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,559
So they call her the runaway bride.

259
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,659
I can't imagine this actually happening to someone.

260
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,279
I mean, you have all your family there, your friends.

261
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:34,799
I know, it'd be so embarrassing.

262
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,679
It's amazing.

263
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,759
And expensive.

264
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,220
Exactly, because you've already paid for everything.

265
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,259
So do you get to eat the cake if you're the one who's left behind?

266
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:43,259
I think so.

267
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,440
Everything's paid for, right?

268
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,019
Exactly.

269
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,980
And drink all the liquor.

270
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,500
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,000
