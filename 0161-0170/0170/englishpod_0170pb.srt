00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Katherine, and today we're talking about a very important day in a couple's life.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're going to a wedding, but this time it's not going to be so romantic because actually the groom is having second thoughts about the wedding.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay, that means he's nervous, and he's not positive he wants to get married today.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So Let's jump right into this dialogue, listen to what's going on, and when we come back we'll be talking about some of the words and phrases you've heard.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I know, I know.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's think this through.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Second of all, you are just getting cold feet.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know deep down inside that you want to marry her.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So cut the crap and do it.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're right.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm being crazy.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, I'm ready.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's do this.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Great.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Phew.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That was a close one.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You had me going there for a minute.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All right, we're back.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So almost, he almost didn't get married, but luckily you have a good friend to help you out.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Exactly.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So this friend really saved the day, made sure that the groom didn't get too nervous and had some really positive words.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
So let's take a listen to some of these marriage words in today's language takeaway.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Language takeaway.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
All right.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So as you mentioned, we have this word marriage.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now marriage is the noun form, right, of actually getting married or to be married.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Right.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Marriage is the noun, the word that describes the relationship between two married people.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And so you have a relationship, maybe you're dating, but once you get married, the thing between you as a man and a woman, that's your marriage.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Your marriage.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So you could say, our marriage is in danger.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We need to work on our marriage.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or we have a happy marriage.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
All right.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So that's marriage.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, if you get married, and this guy, he mentioned a phrase, which was to settle down.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To settle down.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is a very important phrase.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
To settle down means to get serious, mature, and to stop living like a child.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It means really to have a house or to start having kids.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a time in life.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So to settle down is to become more stable, right?

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
As you say, to buy a house, to have a family, to stay in one place and not be so adventurous or stuff like that.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Exactly.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So it's to calm down and to be more fixed in life.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All right.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now, the opposite of this would be to be a bachelor.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Right.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So bachelor is a single man, someone who's not married.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And you often hear this term when we talk about apartments.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So bachelor pad is an apartment that's specific to a single man.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Usually there's lots of video games and a fancy TV and a pool table.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Exactly.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
All right.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So bachelor, we had a lesson about this called bachelor party.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Which is a party for a man right before he gets married.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And a bachelor is a special word for a man who's not yet married.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Very good.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And now, as they were talking about not getting married, he said that you can't leave Amy at the altar.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hmm.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So you often hear this in movies.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She got left at the altar or you can't leave her at the altar.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This word altar is actually religious.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Altar is the table in a church where the priest does all of his work.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So an altar is a special religious table.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So usually two people will stand in front of an altar and get married, right, with the priest who is doing his thing there.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He says, do you, Joe, take Samantha to be your bride, blah, blah, blah.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So that happens at a special place called the altar.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay, very good.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's also common in the normal mass, like on Sundays.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And for the last word or phrase today, it's to get cold feet.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're just getting cold feet.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So this is a very funny phrase in English because it doesn't actually mean that your feet are cold.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So cold feet means you're nervous about something.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You might change your mind.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay.

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So people often talk about men and women getting cold feet before a wedding.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But you can also relate it to any other situation, not only getting married, right?

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
For example, I'm going to go jump out of an airplane tomorrow.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Fast forward tomorrow.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Oh, no, I have cold feet.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't think I want to jump out of an airplane.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay.

105
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So that's to get cold feet, to have second thoughts or doubts about actually doing something.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Exactly.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Cold feet.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
All right.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's keep a lookout for all of these words and we'll be back in a little bit.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Man, I'm freaking out.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You got to help me.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Whoa, whoa.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Take it easy.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Relax.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What's going on?

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't go through with this.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I just can't.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not ready for marriage.

121
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What was I thinking?

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm only 35 years old.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Adventure's waiting.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can't settle down yet.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What are you talking about?

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's think this through.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You know deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So cut the crap and do it.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're right.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm being crazy.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay, I'm ready.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's do this.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Great.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Phew.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That was a close one.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You had me going there for a minute.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
All right, we're back.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases that we found in this dialogue on Fluency Builder.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Fluency Builder This first one is a really great phrase because it's very...

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, it's easy to picture this, what we're describing.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sweating like a pig.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
To sweat like a pig.

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, you are sweating like a pig.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
All right, this is a way to say that someone is sweating a lot.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A lot.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, and it's really gross or disgusting.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now, do pigs actually sweat?

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't know if pigs actually sweat, but you imagine someone smells bad and they have, you know, sweat on their face and their back and their arms.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
All right, well sometimes don't you say you're sweating like a dog?

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You could also say that.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I guess we like animals in English, but this is just a really great way to say that someone is really sweaty.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And, well, he was sweating and he was really nervous because he said, I can't go through with this.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What does he mean, go through with this?

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
With what?

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
To go through with means to actually do something, okay?

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So maybe I say, I don't want to jump out of an airplane.

167
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't go through with this.

168
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't jump.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So it depends on what we're actually talking about.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
If we're talking about a wedding, you say, I can't go through with this.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't get married.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So if you're planning a robbery, you say, well, in the last minute, I couldn't go through with it.

173
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I backed out.

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I can't complete what I talked about doing.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, and now the friend, he finally gets kind of angry and he says, cut the crap.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Oh, man, this is a very common phrase.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All right.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Someone says this if they don't want to listen to you complain anymore, okay?

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Marco, cut the crap, okay?

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't want to hear your excuses.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't want to hear your complaints.

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I want to just hear solutions, solutions, ideas, positive things.

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So to cut the crap is no more complaints, no more excuses, or no more talking nonsense.

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Exactly, and this is common among teachers and, well, parents.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
All right, so cut the crap.

186
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Now, it's not very polite, right?

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you wouldn't really say it to your boss or like a friend.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Cut the crap is kind of rude, and it's a very spoken language, so I wouldn't write it down, and I would not use this with someone who is like a teacher, well...

189
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, like an authority.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You don't use it with them.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
They might use it with you.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay, and for our last phrase, he said, you had me going there for a while, or you had me going there for a minute.

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, so this is a really interesting phrase.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We use this a lot in English, but it's not clear from listening to it what it might mean, so you had me going there, and this sense means, oh, I was really nervous for a minute.

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I really believed what you were saying.

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Exactly, so maybe we could give an example, Marco.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Did you know that yesterday I won the lottery?

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I mean, I won like a million dollars, and I had the perfect numbers.

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, my God, really?

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Can I have a million dollars?

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I would love to help you out, ma'am, but yeah, no, I didn't actually win a million dollars.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You had me going there for a minute.

204
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You believed me.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You believed me.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay, maybe not.

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's not that gullible.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
All right, but that's what it means, right?

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
To believe someone's story or to think that something's going to happen even though it doesn't.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You had me going there.

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That means what you thought was going to happen didn't happen.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So you can use it in the third person as like, yeah, I was telling him this awesome story, and I really had him going for a while.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He really believed me, and then I told him it wasn't true.

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Okay, great phrases.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Now let's listen to our dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more about getting cold feet.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Man, I'm freaking out.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You've got to help me.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Whoa, whoa, take it easy.

219
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Relax.

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Jeez, you're sweating like a pig.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's going on?

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't go through with this.

223
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just can't.

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not ready for marriage.

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What was I thinking?

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm only 35 years old.

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I've got my entire life ahead of me.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Adventure's waiting.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I can't settle down yet.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What are you talking about?

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It wasn't more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family.

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I know, I know.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's think this through.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
First of all, you cannot leave Amy at the altar.

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Not only will she be humiliated and kill you, but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams.

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this?

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Second of all, you were just getting cold feet.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, deep down inside that you'd want to marry her.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So cut the crap and do it.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You're right.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm being crazy.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, I'm ready.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's do this.

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Great.

245
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Whew.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That was a close one.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You had me going there for a minute.

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I thought I was going to have to slap some sense into you.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Alright, so this is a popular scenario, right?

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Somebody on their wedding day, they get cold feet and they back out.

251
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
TV, movies, books, everyone loves the situation.

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Have you ever actually heard of or experienced or maybe known of somebody who actually left the bride at the altar or the groom at the altar?

253
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know anyone who did that.

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Luckily, I think it's really sad.

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, me neither.

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't think it's really that common.

257
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, but there was a movie just about this so there's a woman, Julia Roberts, who tries and tries and tries to get married but never can so it's called Runaway Bride because every time she goes to the altar she gets nervous, she gets cold feet and she runs away.

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So they call her the runaway bride.

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't imagine this actually happening to someone.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I mean, you have all your family there, your friends.

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I know, it'd be so embarrassing.

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's amazing.

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And expensive.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Exactly, because you've already paid for everything.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So do you get to eat the cake if you're the one who's left behind?

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I think so.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Everything's paid for, right?

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Exactly.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And drink all the liquor.

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Alright, so that's all the time we have for today.

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
