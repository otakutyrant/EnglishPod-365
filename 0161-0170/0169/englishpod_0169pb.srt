00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,460
And my name is Catherine, and today we have a great elementary-level lesson all about having fun.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,300
That's right.

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:20,780
Today we are going to have a lot of fun, and, well, before we explain what exactly we're going to do, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,899
Vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,260
Okay, so the word we're previewing today is a noun.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:28,980
It's a thing.

9
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:30,760
It's a rollercoaster.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,479
All right, a rollercoaster.

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,020
So that's what we're going to do today.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,960
We're going to get on a rollercoaster, but what is a rollercoaster?

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:53,780
Well, a rollercoaster is something that we see oftentimes in parks, amusement parks, and it's like a little train, but it can go upside down, and it goes very fast, and it turns, and it's supposed to make you scared and happy.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,619
Okay.

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,320
So it goes very fast, and, yeah, many people have probably seen it.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,920
It goes very fast, and as you say, up and down, and, well, you just get on it because it's fun.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,280
You go fast, and you get scared because you're going so fast, and sometimes you're going upside down.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:09,980
Exactly.

19
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,920
And for some reason, I don't know why, but in many romance languages, the name is Russian mountains.

20
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:15,840
Exactly, yeah.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,140
In Spanish, it's also a Russian mountain, MontaÃ±a Russa.

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:28,819
So I think the reason is because back in the day, back, you know, a hundred years ago when they were starting, the first rollercoasters came from Russia.

23
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,359
Oh, wow.

24
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:29,719
Yeah.

25
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:30,700
So that's why it's called, like...

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,359
Well, that's a theory.

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm not sure.

28
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,439
But take a listen to today's dialogue.

29
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,500
We'll hear it one time, and when we come back, we'll be talking about more interesting and exciting phrases and words about rollercoasters.

30
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,680
I'm so excited!

31
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,400
We're finally here!

32
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,500
Six Flags Magic Mountain.

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,519
This is the best amusement park in the world!

34
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,780
Alright, settle down now.

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,379
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,699
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,300
Seems like such a ripoff, don't you think?

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,580
It's not like I'm gonna get on these things.

39
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:15,879
Whoa.

40
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,639
Viper.

41
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,800
That's the world's highest and fastest rollercoaster!

42
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,520
You go at more than 100 miles per hour.

43
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:23,900
I'm gonna go on that one.

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,060
Can I, Mom, please?

45
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,719
Can I?

46
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,039
Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that.

47
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,800
It seems a bit too much for you, and we just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,180
I don't think it's a good idea.

49
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,259
Aw, come on, Mom.

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,479
I can handle it.

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,599
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

52
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,560
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna throw up or anything.

53
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,020
Let him go, Carol.

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,699
He'll be fine.

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,180
Alright!

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,219
Yeah, this is amazing!

57
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,259
See how high up we're going?

58
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,159
Whoa!

59
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,219
Alright, we're back.

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,340
So, uh, interesting.

61
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,900
I think this is very common.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,199
You get on one of these things, you go so fast that you just throw up.

63
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:10,479
Have you ever thrown up?

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Uh, on a rollercoaster?

65
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,300
No, never.

66
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,879
No, me neither.

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,740
Alright, well, maybe it's not that common, but let's take a look at some of the words that we hear in this conversation between a boy and his parents.

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:31,020
Alright, so as we mentioned, uh, this word, throw up, to throw up, why don't we take a look at that one first, although it's almost at the end of the dialogue, um, what is it to throw up?

69
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:37,919
Okay, well, to throw is different than to throw up, so remember that these two words go together to mean to vomit.

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,979
That means that the things in your stomach come out your mouth.

71
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,819
Mm-hmm, so like we heard in the dialogue, they came in like bleh.

72
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:57,939
Yeah, it's very, it's a very disgusting sound, right, and so sometimes people throw up when they eat too much, sometimes they throw up when they're sick, and sometimes they throw up after riding a rollercoaster, and so this is, this is an important phrase to know.

73
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:03,240
Or like when you're on a boat, you get seasick and you throw up, or in a car, sometimes you get carsick.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,419
Alright, so as we mentioned, we're also visiting an amusement park, so why don't we explain this word a little bit?

75
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,479
Amusement park.

76
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,660
Okay, first of all, everyone probably knows the word park, you know, it's a public place, but in this case, an amusement park is a park of fun.

77
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:33,139
Amusement means fun, and so it's usually a place that you go to and you pay a price, and they give you a ticket, and you can play all day long, so they have rollercoasters and food and shows.

78
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:39,139
So probably the most famous or well-known amusement park is Disneyland, so that's an amusement park.

79
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:42,360
Exactly, and there's lots of fun things to do for people of all ages.

80
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,779
Alright, and now the kid was so excited that the mom said, alright, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

81
00:04:49,639 --> 00:05:15,040
Okay, well, a heart attack is another serious health issue, we talked about throwing up before, is when your heart stops beating, right, so maybe something is stuck, or there's some problem with your heart, and there's no more blood going through your heart, and so it's a very, very serious issue, but in this case, she's saying, you're so excited, you might hurt your heart, you're gonna have a heart attack.

82
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,180
You might hurt yourself because you're so excited.

83
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,779
Right, so she's exaggerating, that's not really going to happen, but she's trying to warn him.

84
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:29,860
Alright, and now the father mentioned that they paid $35 for each of their tickets, and he thought it was a rip-off.

85
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay, rip-off is a great, great phrase that we use in spoken English to describe something that's unfair, so a price that's unfair.

86
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:46,079
Okay, so you can maybe go to the market, right, and you ask how much a sweater is, and they'll tell you it's $100.

87
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,899
You think that's a rip-off.

88
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:53,759
What a rip-off, I can buy a sweater for $20, so $100 is definitely a rip-off.

89
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,060
Alright, so that's a rip-off, it was a rip-off, he's not very happy with how much money he paid.

90
00:05:59,399 --> 00:05:59,860
Not at all.

91
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:13,139
Alright, and now the kid was talking about the roller coaster that is the highest and fastest roller coaster, and he said that the speed was at more than 100 miles per hour, so what about this miles per hour?

92
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:28,860
Okay, this is very important if you go to America, you'll see that the speeds on the road are all in miles per hour, so mile is a distance, and per hour means how many miles you can travel every hour, so in one hour you can go 100 miles.

93
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,560
So we have the equivalent, right?

94
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,279
We have like kilometers per hour.

95
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,420
Exactly, and so miles per hour, kilometers per hour, these are both called speeds.

96
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,399
Okay, and well this is called the imperial system, right?

97
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:52,879
You use miles, you use inches and feet, whereas the kilometers or centimeters or meters, you would use the metric system, right?

98
00:06:52,899 --> 00:07:05,040
Exactly, because the counting is done by meters, meters metric, so in this case, we're in America, we know that because the speed limit is 100 miles, or the speed here is 100 miles an hour.

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,639
We know that we're in America because the speed the boy is talking about is miles per hour.

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,019
Very good, and I think, yeah, use it in North America, and that's pretty much it, right?

101
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,259
I think they use miles in Britain.

102
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:18,740
Really?

103
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,379
Yeah, I'm not positive, I'd have to check with my British friends.

104
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:29,579
Alright, okay, so that's all the words we have for Language Takeaway, let's listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to explain some phrases.

105
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm so excited, we're finally here, Six Flags Magic Mountain, this is the best amusement park in the world.

106
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,639
Alright, settle down now, you're going to give yourself a heart attack.

107
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:52,579
I can't believe they charge us $35 each, it seems like such a rip off, don't you think?

108
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,879
It's not like I'm going to get on these things.

109
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,120
Whoa, Viper, that's the world's highest and fastest rollercoaster!

110
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,339
You go at more than 100 miles per hour, I want to go on that one, can I, Mom, please?

111
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:05,980
Can I?

112
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:13,500
Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that, it seems a bit too much for you, and we've just had breakfast 30 minutes ago, I don't think it's a good idea.

113
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,879
Come on, Mom, I can handle it, I promise I won't ask for anything else, besides, it's not like I'm going to throw up or anything.

114
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,980
Let him go, Carol, he'll be fine.

115
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,800
Alright!

116
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,860
Yeah, this is amazing!

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,959
See how high up we're going?

118
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,839
Whoa!

119
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:41,139
Alright, we're back, so now why don't we start with three phrases that we have prepared for you today in Fluency Builder.

120
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,620
Fluency Builder.

121
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:53,700
Okay, this first phrase, Marco, is definitely a parent phrase, okay, so this is something that you often hear parents sing to their children, they say, settle down now.

122
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,779
Settle down now.

123
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,879
Teachers say this too, yeah.

124
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,559
Alright, everyone, settle down.

125
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:10,779
That means if I'm really excited and I want to talk and I'm running around the room and my teacher says, settle down now, that means quiet down, go slowly, sit down, don't talk, it means calm down.

126
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:34,120
Calm down, yeah, so to calm down, to relax, settle down, alright, and now the next phrase is a very kids phrase, I think, right, that you would use on your parents, so if they say, no, you can't go to your friend's house, oh, come on, please, oh, mom, come on, alright, so what do you mean with that phrase, come on, come on, what?

127
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:50,340
So in this, we have a child who's asking something, he's saying, can you please let me do something, please, come on, that means I'm encouraging you to change your mind or to let me do something, so please let me have my way.

128
00:09:50,340 --> 00:10:31,460
Right, right, alright, so come on, and you don't only use it as a child or with your parents, right, you can encourage your friends to like, come on, come with me to the bar, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, alright, very good, if you want to, and our last phrase, I can handle it, okay, this is next to the phrase, oh, come on, so the boy is trying to explain that he's big enough and old enough to go on a rollercoaster but his mother doesn't know, she says, oh, I don't know, you know, you're too young, and so he says, I can handle it, that means I am big enough and old enough to go on a rollercoaster, I won't have a problem.

129
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:42,419
So you can do it, right, basically, I am good enough to do it, so for example, if I give you a very hard project, you can say, I can handle it, I can do it.

130
00:10:42,559 --> 00:11:01,980
You could also say, I'm very busy right now, I can't handle it, okay, I can't, I can't do it, sorry, I can't do it, alright, very good, interesting phrases there, they're very useful and very, very common in spoken English in North America and, well, a lot of places, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the third time and we'll be back.

131
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:28,220
I'm so excited, we're finally here, Six Flags Magic Mountain, this is the best amusement park in the world, alright, settle down now, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

132
00:11:28,220 --> 00:14:11,080
I can't believe they charge us $35 each, seems like such a rip off, don't you think, it's not like I'm gonna get on these things, whoa, Viper, that's the world's highest and fastest rollercoaster, you go on more than 100 miles per hour, I'm gonna go on that one, can I mom, please, can I, Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that, it seems a bit too much for you and we just had breakfast 30 minutes ago, I don't think it's a good idea, come on mom, I can handle it, I promise I won't ask for anything else, besides, it's not like I'm gonna throw up or anything, let him go, Carol, he'll be fine, alright, yeah, this is amazing, see how high up we're going, whoa, alright, so this amusement park, Magic Mountain, it actually exists in the United States, right, it does, and Six Flags is really a brand, so there are many different parks, amusement parks called Six Flags and each one has a different name, I'm not sure where Magic Mountain is, that one's in California, then you have like Six Flags Greater America, yeah, that's my Chicago Six Flags, so they're basically amusement parks and they're famous because they have really great or intense roller coasters, right, exactly, so the one that we heard about in today's dialogue is called Viper, like the snake, and that one is at the amusement park in California you know, but the famous ride in Chicago is Batman the Ride, oh really, because you sit on a seat but there's no place for your feet, so your feet swing in the wind, and it's very fast and you don't actually sit on a train, right, the track is on top of your head, exactly, so you're hanging, so you see everyone downstairs, well not downstairs, down at the bottom, and I hear they have a very serious problem with people losing their shoes, I heard about this, people wearing sandals and they just fly off, exactly, so I want to warn everyone, if you go to Chicago or you go to these upside down, these flipped roller coasters, you should bring real shoes, not sandals, well as we mentioned, in many languages, in the Romance languages they're called Russian mountains, so I wonder, for our Russian listeners, do you have any intense or great roller coasters in Russia, I mean if they come from Russia they should have amazing roller coasters there, right, that's right, or do you have any idea why we call them Russian mountains in other languages, please let us know, our website is EnglishPod.com, we also welcome your questions and comments on other issues, so until next time everyone, bye.
