00:00:01,239 --> 00:00:13,720
EnglishPod.com I'm so excited!

2
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:15,480
We're finally here!

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,559
Six Flags Magic Mountain!

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,579
This is the best amusement park in the world!

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,839
Alright, settle down now.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,460
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

7
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,780
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,379
Seems like such a rip-off, don't you think?

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,759
It's not like I'm gonna get on these things.

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:33,939
Whoa!

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:34,659
Viper!

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,840
That's the world's highest and fastest roller coaster!

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,579
You go at more than 100 miles per hour.

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,960
I'm gonna go on that one.

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,119
Can I, Mom, please?

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:43,780
Can I?

17
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,119
Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that.

18
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,859
It seems a bit too much for you, and we just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,219
I don't think it's a good idea.

20
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,320
Aw, come on, Mom!

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,539
I can handle it.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,659
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

23
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:59,640
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna throw up or anything.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,079
Let him go, Carol.

25
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:01,840
He'll be fine.

26
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:05,520
Alright!

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,980
Yeah!

28
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,280
This is amazing!

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,319
See how high up we go?

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,219
Whoa!
