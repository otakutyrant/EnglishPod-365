00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:13,000
EnglishPod.com I'm so excited!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're finally here!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Six Flags Magic Mountain!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the best amusement park in the world!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Alright, settle down now.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're gonna give yourself a heart attack.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I can't believe they charge us $35 each.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Seems like such a rip-off, don't you think?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's not like I'm gonna get on these things.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Whoa!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Viper!

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's the world's highest and fastest roller coaster!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You go at more than 100 miles per hour.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm gonna go on that one.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Can I, Mom, please?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Can I?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Chris, I'm not sure you should get on that.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It seems a bit too much for you, and we just had breakfast 30 minutes ago.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't think it's a good idea.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Aw, come on, Mom!

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can handle it.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I promise I won't ask for anything else.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Besides, it's not like I'm gonna throw up or anything.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let him go, Carol.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He'll be fine.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Alright!

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah!

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is amazing!

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
See how high up we go?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Whoa!
