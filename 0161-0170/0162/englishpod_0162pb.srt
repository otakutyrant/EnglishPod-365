00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,599
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:11,039
And my name is Kathryn, and today we are talking about an important holiday the world over.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:19,059
It's very important all over the world, especially in the United States, so let's take a look at this holiday in vocabulary preview.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,480
Vocabulary preview.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,699
So the name of the holiday is Veterans Day, so veteran.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,059
So what's a veteran?

7
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:36,140
A veteran is a person who has participated in a war or in some kind of military situation.

8
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:43,320
Okay, so Veterans Day is a day where you commemorate all the people that fought in the different wars.

9
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,140
Exactly.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:52,619
A veteran doesn't have to be a World War II veteran, they could be a Civil War veteran or a Vietnam War veteran, just a general term.

11
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:52,960
Or a Gulf War.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,799
Exactly.

13
00:00:53,799 --> 00:01:02,640
Alright, so that's the day in the United States where everyone honors all the soldiers that participated in different wars and they fought for their country.

14
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,159
Alright, so why don't we take a look at our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back.

15
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,140
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

16
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,939
You mean, Amistus Day?

17
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,579
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:23,840
November 11th is Veterans Day.

19
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,840
What planet are you from?

20
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:32,500
Well, as you know, on November 11th the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also known as the Amistus Treaty.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,640
This marked the end of World War I and many countries around the world commemorated this date under names such as Remembrance Day.

22
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,780
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,099
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

24
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,980
Wow, I didn't know.

25
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,939
Probably because I flunked history in school.

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:04,739
Alright, so there's a lot of really great vocabulary in this elementary lesson, so let's take a look at some of these words and phrases in Language Takeaway.

27
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:16,919
Language Takeaway Alright, so the first word that came up after the guy mentioned Veterans Day, the girl mentioned Armistice Day.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Armistice.

29
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,240
Okay, so what is this Armistice Day?

30
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,039
Armistice means to stop fighting, right?

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,479
So it's a time in which people lay down their arms, we say.

32
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:35,960
And it's one that's celebrated in Commonwealth countries like England or Canada and in parts of Europe.

33
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:37,340
Okay, very good.

34
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,099
So Armistice Day, kind of like the equivalent for Commonwealth countries to Veterans Day.

35
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:52,580
Alright, and well, the girl gave him a bit of a history lesson and mentioned that on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty.

36
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,759
So we have two great words here, Allies.

37
00:02:55,659 --> 00:03:07,240
So Allies is a word that we use in English to indicate people who fought against the Germans, Italians, and Japanese in World War II.

38
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:13,800
So Allies include Great Britain, America, France for some time.

39
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,780
So these are countries that were, and Russia, they were fighting against the Germans.

40
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,800
Right, so in general terms, an ally is a friend, right?

41
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,300
Exactly.

42
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,960
So Marco and our allies, if there's a fight, I'm on his side.

43
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,099
The opposite of enemies.

44
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,840
Exactly.

45
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,400
Very good.

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,780
And well, the Allies signed a peace treaty.

47
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,199
So what is a peace treaty?

48
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:44,319
A treaty is a document that outlines new rules for a situation, and a peace treaty is a document that calls for peace.

49
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,879
It says we will not fight anymore, we will have peace, and this is what this means.

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,879
So we have new rules.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,819
So it's an agreement.

52
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,800
It's like a contract.

53
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,379
Exactly.

54
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,020
It's a contract between nations.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:55,620
Okay.

56
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,180
Very good.

57
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:03,199
Alright, and as we mentioned, Veterans Day or Armistice Day, we commemorate these events that happened in the past.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,840
So to commemorate something.

59
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:05,479
Right.

60
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,740
So in a sense, we are honoring it.

61
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,800
So to commemorate is to remember, to honor, to...

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,819
Remember with respect.

63
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,979
So yeah, to remember with respect, exactly.

64
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:17,519
There's a positive, respectful tone here.

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,459
It's remembering for a good reason.

66
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,660
Okay, very good.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,899
So we've taken a look at these four words.

68
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,860
Why don't we listen to our dialogue again?

69
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,459
And we'll be back in a bit to look at Fluency Builder.

70
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:34,160
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,980
You mean Armistice Day?

72
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,660
What are you talking about?

73
00:04:37,899 --> 00:04:39,879
November 11th is Veterans Day.

74
00:04:40,339 --> 00:04:41,899
What planet are you from?

75
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,560
Well, as you know, on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also known as the Armistice Treaty.

76
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,680
This marked the end of World War One, and many countries around the world commemorated this date under names such as Remembrance Day.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,819
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,139
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

79
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,019
Wow.

80
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,040
I didn't know.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,040
Probably because I flunked history in school.

82
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:12,439
Today's Fluency Builder includes a couple of really interesting phrases that are kind of longer.

83
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,939
So let's take a look at the first one, which is very, very common in English.

84
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:17,439
All right.

85
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,019
So this first sentence was kind of using a sarcastic tone because he said, what are you talking about?

86
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:22,680
Right.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,759
So this guy says, Veterans Day?

88
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,759
Oh, you mean Armistice Day?

89
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,540
What are you talking about?

90
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,819
That means no.

91
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,459
I mean, Veterans Day.

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Right.

93
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,759
So he wasn't really asking like, what are you talking about?

94
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,379
He was literally saying with this sentence, are you crazy or like, you're wrong.

95
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:40,019
You're wrong.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,519
Mm hmm.

97
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:50,060
So what are you talking about is a way, very sarcastic way to say, listen, I think you're wrong or you must be a little bit crazy.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,500
Right.

99
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:51,680
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:52,519
All right.

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:59,500
And then to end the whole sarcastic sentence there, he said, what planet are you from?

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,879
So, obviously, this is Veterans Day.

103
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,819
What planet are you from?

104
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,339
So you're so wrong.

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,120
How do you not understand what this is?

106
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:09,339
How do you not know this?

107
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:16,319
And so, for example, I could say, maybe I'll ask you, Marco, who's the president of the United States?

108
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,019
All right.

109
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,040
I can say, well, what planet are you from?

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,819
It's obviously President Obama.

111
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:22,259
Oh, duh.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,379
So it's like, obviously, everybody knows this.

113
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:28,800
So you're saying, how do you not like, how do you not know this already?

114
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,920
So it's very sarcastic.

115
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,240
What planet are you from?

116
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:37,040
And finally, the guy is talking about how he doesn't understand what the meaning of Veterans Day is.

117
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,259
And after this long explanation, he says, well, I didn't know.

118
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,639
Probably because I flunked history in school.

119
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,500
So if you flunked history or you flunked any subject in school, it means you didn't pass.

120
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,120
Exactly.

121
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,139
So flunk, to flunk, is a verb in English, and it means to fail a subject.

122
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:05,399
That means maybe in 100% is perfect, you got 50% or 40%, and you have to take the course again.

123
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,639
Did you ever flunk an exam in school?

124
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,600
No.

125
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:10,620
No, really, you didn't?

126
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:10,939
Never?

127
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,300
No.

128
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:11,819
Wow.

129
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,120
Such a good student.

130
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:13,839
Did you?

131
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
Maybe I did, maybe once or twice.

132
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,120
I was much too self-critical.

133
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:20,959
All right.

134
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,519
Let's listen to this dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

135
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,819
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

136
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,660
You mean Armistice Day?

137
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,300
What are you talking about?

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,540
November 11th is Veterans Day.

139
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,579
What planet are you from?

140
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,240
Well, as you know, on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also known as the Armistice Treaty.

141
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,339
This marked the end of World War I, and many countries around the world commemorated this date under names such as Remembrance Day.

142
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,500
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

143
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,819
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

144
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,699
Wow.

145
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,740
I didn't know.

146
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,800
Probably because I flunked history in school.

147
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,939
All right, so Veterans Day, it's a big deal in the United States, right?

148
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,980
It's a very big deal.

149
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:18,600
There's a parade.

150
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,180
Yeah.

151
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,439
In most cities in the country, there are parades.

152
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,480
And when I was in school, we had to play music, because I was in band, we used to play music for the veterans, and we'd go to the cemetery and play Taps.

153
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,699
Da-da-da, da-da-da.

154
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:33,159
No, we didn't play Taps.

155
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,480
It was...

156
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,639
Da-da-da, da-da-da.

157
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,820
That's like the funeral song?

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,460
I don't know what it's called.

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:47,340
Yeah, we would play funeral songs and Taps for the local veterans, who would be respecting and commemorating fallen soldiers.

160
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:47,899
Wow.

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,059
And the president talks as well, like on national TV and stuff.

162
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:51,379
That's right.

163
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:51,940
That's right.

164
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,480
All right.

165
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,899
So it's very interesting, especially the history lesson, the fact that on November, I think it's called 11-11-11, right?

166
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,940
November 11th, at 11 o'clock, they signed this armistice treaty.

167
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,600
And that was in 1918.

168
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:15,200
So this is World War I, we're talking about when the world had never really seen fighting like this before.

169
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:15,600
Right.

170
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,279
