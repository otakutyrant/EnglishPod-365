00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You mean Armistice Day?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
November 11th is Veterans Day.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What planet are you from?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, as you know, on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also known as the Armistice Treaty.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This marked the end of World War I, and many countries around the world commemorated this date under names such as Remembrance Day.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wow, I didn't know.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Probably because I flunked history in school.
