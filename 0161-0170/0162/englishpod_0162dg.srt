00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,859
Do you have any plans for Veterans Day?

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,660
You mean Armistice Day?

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,320
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,560
November 11th is Veterans Day.

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,600
What planet are you from?

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Well, as you know, on November 11th, the Allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans, also known as the Armistice Treaty.

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:29,359
This marked the end of World War I, and many countries around the world commemorated this date under names such as Remembrance Day.

00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,500
In Poland, it's their Independence Day.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,899
There's a lot going on around the world on this day.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,740
Wow, I didn't know.

11
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,659
Probably because I flunked history in school.
