00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,299
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,040
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,259
My name is Catherine, and today we have a very special lesson for everyone.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a new level for us.

5
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:12,519
Right.

6
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:17,079
It's an advanced media lesson, and we are going to be listening to an apology.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,500
Well, it's an apology letter, but we're going to actually have someone talk it out.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,179
Right.

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:40,020
So what's happening here is someone is reading a letter they've written, and they're trying to apologize for something, and we don't really know what the something is, but I want everyone to really listen here to the words that are being used and to the ways in which we can say sorry, because as they say, there are a thousand ways to say I'm sorry.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,340
Dear Mary, I come here today this way because I need to apologize to you.

11
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,679
I failed you.

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,020
Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong to me.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,880
I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,280
You mean the world to me, and now I come to you asking for forgiveness.

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,819
If in your heart you find you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,060
You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most.

17
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:24,000
We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually feel something other than hurt.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:33,379
You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence when there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall, and completeness where there was emptiness.

19
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,560
I wanted to hold on to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice.

20
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:47,219
What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all of that I had placed in you.

21
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,040
I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk.

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,400
I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle.

23
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,340
I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible.

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,379
I wanted to love you in only the way you deserved to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying myself and you.

25
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,099
Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life.

26
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,639
The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.

27
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,120
All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true.

28
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,659
Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy.

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,139
You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful.

30
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,599
You helped me look forward to another day.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,659
Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.

32
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,819
I'm sorry for hurting you.

33
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,580
And if I had to do it all over again, I would have been 100% with you.

34
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,300
Forgive me, please.

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,539
Alright, we're back, so the guy seems to be pretty sad.

36
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,400
Yeah, this is a very intense, well, it's not a dialogue, it's a monologue.

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,520
One person is reading it, so it's a very intense monologue.

38
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,539
Very romantic.

39
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah, romantic, but also an air of melancholy.

40
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:15,539
Yeah, that's true, he's kind of like apologizing and at the same time expressing love and all these feelings, so it was very interesting.

41
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,560
But why don't we take a look at a couple of phrases.

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:29,819
Now, in advanced media, we're not going to analyze the entire dialogue or, as we do in the other levels, actually pick out items for language takeaway or fluency builder.

43
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:36,199
So in advanced media, we're only going to pick out a couple of words and phrases and just talk about it and talk about the topic in general.

44
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:45,539
Exactly, and so one of the first phrases that we decided to talk about here is this phrase I failed you, because this is really the theme of the letter.

45
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,919
So if you fail someone, it means that you let that person down.

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Okay, so you fail someone, I failed you, or you can say he failed me.

47
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,460
So when I really needed that person the most, that person didn't come through or let me down or failed me.

48
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,400
All right, so let's give an example maybe.

49
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:14,719
I needed my brother to pick me up because I don't have a car, and my brother was supposed to pick me up at four o'clock and he forgot, he didn't come, so he really failed me.

50
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,040
All right, he failed you.

51
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,139
Yeah, I was disappointed.

52
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:22,199
Well, that's not as serious as what happened here in this letter, I think, right?

53
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,779
I think so, but we could talk about what did happen.

54
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,379
I think I have a theory, and I know you have a theory, so we can talk about that in a minute.

55
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,839
But before that, we have some other phrases about forgiveness and disappointment.

56
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:38,779
Right, well, he also said, you mean the world to me, and now I come to you asking for forgiveness.

57
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:41,040
Okay, so we've got a positive and a negative.

58
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,180
So the positive here is, you mean the world to me.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,899
You mean the world to me.

60
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,500
This means you are so important to me, you're one of the most important people in my life.

61
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,759
You're worth the entire world, in my opinion.

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,399
Yeah, it's a very poetic way of saying you're very important.

63
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,339
And then he says, and now I come asking for your forgiveness.

64
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,639
Okay, so this implies that he did something wrong.

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,019
I come asking for forgiveness.

66
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,740
So in English, we ask for forgiveness.

67
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,980
You can also beg for forgiveness, so please forgive me.

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,160
Please forgive me.

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,779
You can't demand forgiveness.

70
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,339
I demand you forgive, no, that doesn't quite work.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,019
All right, what else do we have?

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,759
We've got the world again here.

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:32,860
The guy who's reading, he says, you know, I wanted to be the comfort for your soul, so this is very, again, poetic, when the world was too much to handle.

74
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,439
Too much to handle is a really important English phrase, and I'm sure you've heard it before, but we could talk about it a little bit here.

75
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:44,800
Right, so he says when everything else was too much to handle, so everything was so difficult, or it was overwhelming.

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,100
Right, so you could say, even in the office, man, all this work I have to do, it's too much to handle.

77
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:51,860
Right, right.

78
00:05:52,899 --> 00:05:53,560
So too much to handle.

79
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,939
You could also say a child is too much to handle.

80
00:05:56,259 --> 00:05:59,040
I think they said this about my brother, he was very difficult growing up.

81
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,540
Too hard.

82
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,839
He's too difficult to handle.

83
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:02,839
All right.

84
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:09,779
Well, what about in the part where he says, you place comfort where there was fear, confidence where there was doubt.

85
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,860
So this structure is interesting, because you placed something where there used to be something else.

86
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,860
So you're placing something, you're changing something for something else.

87
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,000
It's an exchange.

88
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,100
So you could say you placed comfort where there was fear, you placed happiness where there was sadness.

89
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,019
So it's always like kind of opposites, right?

90
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:30,660
Okay, instead of...

91
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,459
Light where there was dark.

92
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:32,620
Right, exactly.

93
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,360
So that's an interesting format of saying something.

94
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,060
You did something where there used to be something else.

95
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,279
All right, and what about this word, to jeopardize?

96
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,759
This is a good one.

97
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,160
I always think of the TV game show Jeopardy, but that's a noun.

98
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:55,120
This here is a verb, to jeopardize, and that means to put something in danger or to risk losing something.

99
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,139
Okay, so to jeopardize your health if you're doing something dangerous.

100
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,620
So smoking jeopardizes one's health.

101
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,399
You're putting your health at risk.

102
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,939
Or I don't want to jeopardize my savings by investing everything I have in stocks.

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,120
That means I would prefer to do something safer.

104
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,439
So you don't like to jeopardize your well-being.

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,600
I like to play it safe, as we say.

106
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,879
All right, very good.

107
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:30,660
And last but not least, this almost the last phrase when he says, even those distance separated us, just being was enough.

108
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,980
What does he mean when he says just being was enough?

109
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,279
This is very romantic, intensely romantic.

110
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:43,180
He says, even though we were far apart, just being, so just existing, just breathing was enough.

111
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,620
So just knowing that she's in the world was enough for him to feel happy.

112
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,279
So that's what he means with just being was enough.

113
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
Right, so being is existing.

114
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,540
It's being alive.

115
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,259
Okay, very good.

116
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:00,560
I think we should listen to this apology letter one more time, and we'll be back.

117
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,160
Come to you asking for forgiveness.

118
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:33,580
If in your heart you find you can't, then I will understand and learn from this experience.

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,840
You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most.

120
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:44,799
We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually feel something other than hurt.

121
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:54,200
You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence when there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall and completeness where there was emptiness.

122
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,379
I wanted to hold on to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice.

123
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:08,039
What I didn't realize was that I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all of that I had placed in you.

124
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,840
I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk.

125
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,220
I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle.

126
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,159
I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible.

127
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:28,220
I wanted to love you in only the way you deserved to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying myself and you.

128
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,899
Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life.

129
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,440
The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,919
All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true.

131
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,460
Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy.

132
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,980
You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful.

133
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,440
You helped me look forward to another day.

134
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,460
Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.

135
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:02,399
I'm sorry for hurting you and if I had to do it all over again, I would have been 100% with you.

136
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,220
Forgive me please.

137
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,840
Yes, with a but.

138
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,360
You don't write a letter like this to someone who you want to stay friends with.

139
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,940
You write a letter to this to someone who you have some kind of romantic or intense feeling for, right?

140
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:39,159
So to me this seems like a letter that was written to someone who was a great friend and he's afraid of losing that because he cares even more for her.

141
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:39,779
Right.

142
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:45,039
But yeah, I guess, but do you think he's confessing his love in a certain way here?

143
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,980
I think in some ways he's confessing a love.

144
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,759
You can love your friends, that's okay.

145
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,919
But more than that, he's just apologizing for something that he thinks has completely destroyed their friendship.

146
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,419
And that is where I'm very confused because I have no idea what he did.

147
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:09,159
Well maybe he did something that let her down, maybe he became jealous of her new boyfriend or something like that.

148
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:18,620
Yeah, or maybe it's something catty like he was supposed to do something with her and ended up doing something with other people and left her out or embarrassed her in front of people.

149
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,000
It's hard to say.

150
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,620
Have you ever written an apology letter?

151
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,179
Yeah, I have.

152
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,519
I've written a few apology letters.

153
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,620
I have a very strong sense of guilt.

154
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:29,679
I was raised Catholic.

155
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:38,139
So an apology letter, is it, do you usually plan out what you want to say or just like you just splurge your feelings onto the paper?

156
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,139
Well you know me.

157
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:44,159
My personality is very planned and organized and so normally I have points.

158
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,659
So I say, if this is the problem, there's three parts, I have an answer for each part and the very end I have the heartfelt apology.

159
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,019
It's like an essay.

160
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,960
I guess it's a little bit more organized.

161
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,500
If I were to write something like this, I would just like start writing and whatever comes out.

162
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,539
So it would probably make less sense than your letter.

163
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:09,220
Well I just try to stay on focus, stay on point and address the matter at hand because otherwise then you get into other stuff and you can make people more angry.

164
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:09,960
Right.

165
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:12,279
But it is really important to write an apology letter.

166
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:19,879
Now some of the words and phrases and the vocabulary used here can be used in circumstances that are not only romantic, right?

167
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,419
You can be used in a professional way as well, right?

168
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,200
That's true.

169
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,340
In a professional sense you want to be careful not to get too personal.

170
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:36,620
So in a professional sense it's good to say that you're sorry for any mix ups or misunderstandings but in the future you'll try to make things better or improve.

171
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:48,240
But in friendships and in families and in romantic relationships, apology letters are very, very important because I'm a big believer in mending bridges.

172
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:54,399
I know a lot of people who we say in English you know to burn a bridge that means to destroy a relationship and never go back.

173
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,840
But I like to mend bridges to make sure that people who I was friends with don't you know if we have a fight don't just hate me forever.

174
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,860
That even if there's a disagreement that they understand my perspective or that I understand theirs.

175
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,460
That's true.

176
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,360
I think that's important.

177
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,840
What about apology emails?

178
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:09,679
Do you agree with those?

179
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,580
I think that they are a necessity of the 21st century.

180
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,019
I mean I live far away from most of my friends and family and so it's important for me to be able to communicate in any way.

181
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:28,039
And sometimes I mean I'm very shy with some people so sometimes it's hard for me to talk on the phone because I get stuck and then I don't I can't think of what I wanted to say.

182
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:37,559
And so if a letter helps in that way to get you past your fear or your anxiety then by all means an email is just as much.

183
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,659
I actually received a letter a handwritten letter through an email.

184
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:42,799
How did that happen?

185
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,639
So the person.

186
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,320
They scanned it.

187
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:45,480
They scanned the letter.

188
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh wow.

189
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:54,500
So it was still like it still had a very intimate and personal sense but obviously since the mail takes so long and everything they just scanned it and then they sent it to my email.

190
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:54,960
That's nice.

191
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,240
So I think that's a good idea.

192
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,519
Maybe you can try that one.

193
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,279
I'll try that one.

194
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,019
I don't agree with the the one line email.

195
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
I'm sorry forgive me.

196
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,740
Yeah that's not good.

197
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,679
As my parents always used to say when I was growing up and I'd get in fights with my little brother the only apologies that we accept are the ones that are from the heart.

198
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:17,340
So I used to have to apologize again and again and again until you actually actually meant it.

199
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:27,799
So I think that this is a very true kind of idea that that well maybe not in business and work where you have to be cordial with friends and real relationships with people who you care about.

200
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,220
Obviously real apologies are very important.

201
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:31,960
Of course.

202
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:45,519
So this is an interesting topic and we recommend that you if you have any other questions or doubts or maybe you want some other explanation for this letter you can come to EnglishPod.com leave it in the comments section and we'll be there.

203
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:46,940
So until next time.
