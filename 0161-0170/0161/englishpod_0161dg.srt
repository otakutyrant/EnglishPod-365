EnglishPod.com Mark, where have you been?

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,279
I've been calling you all morning.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,320
I've been playing computer games.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:12,820
What?

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,359
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,339
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,239
What are you playing?

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,760
It's called Counter Strike.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,260
It's a first person shooter game.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,019
It's awesome!

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,699
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,079
You've been wasting your time on this?

13
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,420
I can't believe it.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,579
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

15
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,259
My laptop is on my bed.

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,240
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:39,939
Fine.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,880
Damn it!

19
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:56,140
How are you killing me with a single shot?

20
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,960
It's not fair!

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,500
I don't want to play anymore.

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,359
Let's go get something to eat.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,799
Can you bring me something?

24
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm totally hooked on this game.
