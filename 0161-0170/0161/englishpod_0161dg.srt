EnglishPod.com Mark, where have you been?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I've been calling you all morning.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I've been playing computer games.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are you playing?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's called Counter Strike.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a first person shooter game.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's awesome!

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You've been wasting your time on this?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can't believe it.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My laptop is on my bed.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Fine.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Damn it!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How are you killing me with a single shot?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's not fair!

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't want to play anymore.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go get something to eat.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Can you bring me something?

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm totally hooked on this game.
