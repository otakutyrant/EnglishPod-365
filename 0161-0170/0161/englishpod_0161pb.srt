00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,740
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:12,000
And my name is Katherine, and today, Marco, we're talking about something that I know you're a big fan of.

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,220
I am, we're talking about computer games, video games.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,800
Woohoo!

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:16,579
Woohoo!

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:26,460
So yeah, we're gonna be looking at some vocabulary and phrases related to computer games and video games, and this is actually a request from one of our users.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,560
Awesome, so, before we get started, we do have the name of the game that we're gonna look at, so let's listen to that in today's vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,700
Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,740
Alright, so the game that we're gonna preview today is called Counter-Strike.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,439
Okay, so first you have a strike, or an attack, and then you have a counter-strike.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,820
So that's an opposite attack or something like that, right?

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,600
So it's a reaction to the first thing that happens, so you hit me and my counter-strike is I hit you back.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,700
And this game is actually very, very popular all over the world because many players are able to compete at the same time.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,980
So it's a shooting game, you shoot each other.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,760
You are the terrorists and then the other team is like the police or the army or whatever.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,420
Wow, sounds really exciting.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,780
Well we're gonna learn more about the specific vocab that goes with computer games and video games in a minute, but first let's take a listen to our dialogue.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,959
Terrorists win.

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,159
Mark, where have you been?

20
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,739
I've been calling you all morning.

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,780
I've been playing computer games.

22
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:34,280
What?

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,819
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

24
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,799
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,719
What are you playing?

26
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,219
It's called Counter-Strike.

27
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,719
It's a first person shooter game.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,480
It's awesome!

29
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,159
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.

30
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,519
You've been wasting your time on this?

31
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,879
I can't believe it.

32
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,060
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

33
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,719
My laptop is on my bed.

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,700
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

35
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:01,400
Fine.

36
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:15,300
Dammit!

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,580
How are you killing me with a single shot?

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,400
It's not fair.

39
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,960
I don't want to play anymore.

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,800
Let's go get something to eat.

41
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,280
Can you bring me something?

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm totally hooked on this game.

43
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,419
Alright, we're back.

44
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:35,240
So there was some really interesting vocab here and so let's look at it now in Language Takeaway.

45
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:38,419
Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, so what kind of a game was this, Marco?

47
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:50,560
Alright, this game was a FPS or also in the dialogue we heard a first person shooter game.

48
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,460
So our users might have heard this phrase first person before because it's a grammar term in many ways.

49
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,860
We talk about I, I do this, I can sing.

50
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,219
That's the first person.

51
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:08,240
But when we're talking about games, first person shooter means that what you do, you're doing as if you were the character in the game.

52
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Right, so even the way that you're looking at the game, it seems like you're looking through the eyes of the character.

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,580
Okay, so you don't see the body, you are the body of the person.

54
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,460
So first person shooter, so shooter obviously means that this is a shooting game.

55
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,960
What you do is you pull the trigger and shoot people.

56
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:34,300
And as we mentioned, a lot of players are able to compete against each other, so it's called a multiplayer game.

57
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,780
Okay, so multi is a prefix.

58
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,979
It goes at the beginning of a word.

59
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:44,759
In English that means many, so you could hear multicolored or multiethnic.

60
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:53,500
And the meaning of this is that there are many different colors or many different ethnicities or in this case, multiplayer, many different players at the same time.

61
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:01,360
Exactly, so in this game many players can play whether it's in a local area network or online over the internet.

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,620
Cool, so you actually have to have the internet right when you're doing this because you're using many different computers, so they have to be connected to each other.

63
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,680
Right, and that's our next word, you go online in order to play.

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:24,920
Okay, so online you've heard before, online means on the internet, but in this case the action of using the internet is called going online, so I want to go online to read my email.

65
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,339
Right, or I can't go online, I don't have a connection.

66
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,740
My mom won't let me go online, I'm in trouble.

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,699
Alright, so this is the way that you use it, you go online.

68
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,040
In order to use the internet, you go online.

69
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:37,920
Very interesting.

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:49,160
Well, the last word we've got here in language takeaway is a very important one when we talk about video games because many people are in this situation, they're hooked on video games.

71
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:58,220
Right, so if you are hooked on a video game or you are hooked on anything, it means you're kind of addicted or you're very, very interested in something.

72
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:01,259
Exactly, so I'm hooked on the TV show True Blood.

73
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,100
I love to watch it and I love, every day I run home so I can watch it.

74
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,339
But is there a game that you're hooked on, Marco?

75
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,800
Currently, I am hooked on a game called Guitar Hero Metallica.

76
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:14,839
Ooh, fun.

77
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,319
Yeah, it's really fun.

78
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:19,399
When I borrowed your PS3, I was hooked on Bad Company.

79
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,540
They're great games, it's very easy to get hooked on video games.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,220
Too easy.

81
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,540
Alright, so that's all the words we have for language takeaway, why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back in a bit.

82
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,740
Mark, where have you been?

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,319
I've been calling you all morning.

84
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,379
I've been playing computer games.

85
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:41,860
What?

86
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,420
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

87
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:48,379
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

88
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,300
What are you playing?

89
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,819
It's called Counter Strike.

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,300
It's a first person shooter game.

91
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,060
It's awesome!

92
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,759
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.

93
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
You've been wasting your time on this?

94
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,480
I can't believe it.

95
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,620
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

96
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,620
My laptop is on my bed.

97
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,620
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

98
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:09,259
Fine.

99
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,439
Damn it!

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,600
How are you killing me with a single shot?

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,439
It's not fair.

102
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,980
I don't want to play anymore.

103
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,800
Let's go get something to eat.

104
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,300
Can you bring me something?

105
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm totally hooked on this game.

106
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,680
Alright, we're back and we have a couple of phrases that we want to look at, specifically two phrases.

107
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,839
So let's look at those now in Fluency Builder.

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,000
Fluency Builder.

109
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,079
So what's the deal?

110
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,819
You blew me off yesterday and now you're not even going to say sorry?

111
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,920
Alright, so blew me off.

112
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,000
What do you mean when you say you blew me off yesterday?

113
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,259
Okay, so let's take a look at the infinitive version of this phrase, so to blow someone off.

114
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,660
And they all go together.

115
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,699
It's a fixed phrase.

116
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,100
And this means to have an appointment with someone, but to not go.

117
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,600
So we had a date planned, but he blew me off.

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,699
What a jerk.

119
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:03,540
He didn't go.

120
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:04,879
I went.

121
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,439
But did he tell you that he wasn't going to go?

122
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:06,699
No.

123
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:16,680
So it's a surprise, it's like you expect someone to come meet you or do something with you, but they don't say anything and they don't go.

124
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,680
So there's another word very similar to this one and it's to stand someone up, right?

125
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,480
Exactly.

126
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,139
So he stood me up.

127
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,019
He didn't come.

128
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,000
He blew me off.

129
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,220
Okay, very good.

130
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,540
And what's our next phrase?

131
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,579
To waste your time.

132
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:36,420
Alright, so the girlfriend in this case was like, you're wasting your time on these video games.

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,220
That means you're not getting anything out of this, you're not benefiting.

134
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,439
It means that you could spend your time doing other things.

135
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,060
Okay, so if you're wasting your time on video games, you're not being productive.

136
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:49,939
Exactly.

137
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,939
You're not learning anything.

138
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,779
So your mother might say to you when you're a kid, don't waste your time on games.

139
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,300
You should be studying.

140
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,199
Okay, or he wastes a lot of time watching TV.

141
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,100
That's a common problem.

142
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:09,720
Alright, so let's listen to this dialogue again real fast and we'll be back in a bit.

143
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:15,720
Mark, where have you been?

144
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,300
I've been calling you all morning.

145
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,360
I've been playing computer games.

146
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:19,839
What?

147
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,379
So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game.

148
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,379
What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore?

149
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:27,279
What are you playing?

150
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,800
It's called Counter Strike.

151
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,300
It's a first person shooter game.

152
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,060
It's awesome.

153
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,759
It's a multiplayer game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world.

154
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,100
You've been wasting your time on this?

155
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,440
I can't believe it.

156
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,600
It doesn't even look fun or challenging.

157
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,299
My laptop is on my bed.

158
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,240
If you think it's so easy, then get online and try to beat me.

159
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:46,980
Fine.

160
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:01,019
Damn it!

161
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,159
How are you killing me with a single shot?

162
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:03,980
It's not fair.

163
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,519
I don't want to play anymore.

164
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,360
Let's go get something to eat.

165
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:08,860
Can you bring me something?

166
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,679
I'm totally hooked on this game.

167
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:25,039
Alright, so we talked about, you know, being hooked on TV shows and video games, but this is actually a very big problem in some Asian countries specifically, right?

168
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:26,340
I've heard that.

169
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:37,120
Actually, I heard that in Japan, Korea, and China specifically, there are psychological treatment centers for kids who are addicted to gaming.

170
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:54,120
And so there's a big thing in the news in China recently where there were parents who were sending their kids to this treatment center, rehab for games, and that actually they found out that the rehab center didn't know what they were doing and they were giving the kids electroshock therapy to get them off games.

171
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:54,639
Wow, really?

172
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,240
So the parents took their kids back.

173
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,120
That's scary.

174
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:57,860
It is scary.

175
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,559
But I guess it's a very popular thing in Asian countries specifically, right?

176
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,220
To play online, to go online.

177
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:13,080
There's a lot of other factors that influence this, but I think it is, like, everything in excess is dangerous.

178
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,080
This is true, and actually some people have been using this addiction to be a productive use of their time.

179
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:28,480
So you have some people who play a game called World of Warcraft, and they win money, and they sell things to other players all over the world.

180
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:40,799
And so you have these kids in America buying toys and, like, shields and gold from kids in, for example, Indonesia, and the kid in Indonesia is making money.

181
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,539
Right, right, right.

182
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:49,759
And also, if they're really good, they go on to become professional gamers and compete in world competitions and also test out new video games.

183
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,720
So yeah, it has its advantages as well.

184
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,059
Can you imagine what your business card would look like?

185
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,159
Professional gamer.

186
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,059
Professional gamer.

187
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,000
All right, that's all the time we have for today.
