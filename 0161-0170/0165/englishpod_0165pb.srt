00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And my name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we're talking about money, but this time we're talking about borrowing money.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we're asking for money.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're going to the bank and we are asking for a loan.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But before we go, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So a loan is some money that you get from the bank.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we're talking about requesting a loan today.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All right.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So you request for a loan or you ask for a loan.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Exactly.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So to request is to ask.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Okay.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Very good.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And that's the word that we have for vocabulary preview.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hello, sir.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
May I help you?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I would like some information for requesting a loan.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Very well.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I see.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So let me get this straight.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small portion of the annual interest rate.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have a terrible credit score.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That is a very serious problem, you see.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant information, such as your credit score, in order to approve your loan.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You know what?

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't really need the money.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thanks anyways.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right, we're back.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So now why don't we take a look at some of the key words that we'll find in Language Takeaway.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Language Takeaway.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
All right, so in Language Takeaway today, we have a couple of different words.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why don't we start off with the loan policies?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay, so a policy is like a rule.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
For example, a government can have policies, but in this case, a loan policy is the rules regarding the loan that you have.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right, so maybe the loan policies could include how long, what's the maximum length of your loan, or maybe what's the annual interest rate, etc.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How much you have to pay each month, like that.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So loan policy is the rules related to the loan that you've taken out.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And we have some very, very important words following this, and they go together.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So the first word is to borrow.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, so you probably know this word already, to borrow.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So can I borrow your pen?

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can I borrow some money?

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sure, let me give you my pen, let me give you my money.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But wait, giving is different, because giving means I don't have to get it back.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Right.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So if you want to give it to someone temporarily, then you lend them your pen, or you lend them some money.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Great, so to borrow is to take something from someone, knowing that you will have to give it back later.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And to lend is to give it to someone, right?

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So can you lend me your pen?

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That means can you give it to me, please?

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Right.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And this is a common mistake with language learners, especially English learners, that they make the mistake of using borrow instead of lend.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So can you borrow me some money?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So can you lend me some money?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sure, but I expect you to pay me back later.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, very good.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And if I pay you back later, I'll include an interest rate.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Will you really?

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, not really.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, not really.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mostly it's banks that ask for an interest rate.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So in this case, an interest rate means the amount of money that a bank will charge you in addition to the money that you owe them.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So it's called an interest rate, and it's a rate because it's a percentage.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Like 5%.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Exactly, 5, 10%.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That is an interest rate.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And now moving on, if you have a loan and you have to pay each month, be careful to not default on your payments.

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, default.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In the banking world, this means to not be able to pay your loan.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So that means that if I owe $1,000 to you, Bank of Marco, and I don't have the money, I can't pay for it, then I default.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So to be late or to not make the payment.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a verb, to default.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Very good.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And Will, the person asking for the loan has a small problem, his credit score is not very good.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, I think he calls it terrible.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And one of the ways that you get a terrible credit score is by defaulting on a loan.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But it also means that maybe you borrow money or you have credit cards and you can't pay off your bills.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And so a credit score is very important in America and it's like a report card for your finances.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right, so for example, if your credit score is a report card and you have an A credit score, that means that the banks won't have a problem with lending you money.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Or if you want to buy a new car, it'll be okay.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But if you don't pay your bills on time or you default on your loans, then maybe you'll have a C or a D and then people will not really lend you money in the future.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They won't trust you.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Exactly.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
All right, so that's credit score.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's all the words we have for Fluency Builder, why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back shortly.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hello sir, may I help you?

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, I would like some information for requesting a loan.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Very well.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I see.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So let me get this straight.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small portion of the annual interest rate.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment.

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have a terrible credit score.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That is a very serious problem, you see.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant information, such as your credit score, in order to approve your loan.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know what?

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't really need the money.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thanks anyways.

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right, we're back, so now why don't we take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let me get this straight.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We're going to do Fluency Builder?

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wait, I don't.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wait.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, so this is our first phrase.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let me get this straight, and this is a fixed phrase that means we always say it the same way.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Wait, let me get this straight.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We always say it the same way?

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right, so you're asking for a confirmation, or you're repeating what that person said just to be sure that it's correct.

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Exactly, so maybe you don't understand something, or maybe you think you might have misunderstood.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You say, hey, so let me get this straight, and you repeat what the person just said.

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a way for you to, like you say, get confirmation on what you've heard.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Very good.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let me get this straight, and now moving on, we have the phrase pay it back.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You have to pay it back.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, and so in this case, we have the verb to pay, but we also have the word back, so pay it back means to repay, so if we take out a loan, we obviously have to pay it back to the bank.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Right, so you have to pay the loan back.

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay, so just remember that these words often go together, to pay it back.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll pay you back, I promise.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Right, can you lend me a dollar, I'll pay you back tomorrow.

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Ah, don't worry about it.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right, and the bank started off saying, we pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, right.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
All right, so we pride ourselves.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What does it mean if I pride myself in something?

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The word pride means to be really happy about something that has to do with yourself, so something that you're proud of is something that you want to tell a lot of other people about, so for example, a father may say, my son just got straight A's and he's an excellent soccer player, and so he's proud of his son, but to pride oneself means to be really happy with the way that you do something.

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Right, so for example, if I've never smoked, right, so I can say I pride myself in being a non-smoker.

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Or I could say, I pride myself in always saving lots of money for my paycheck.

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Very good.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So it means I try to do this because I know it's a good thing.

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But you feel very good about this, and you feel that people should be proud of you as well.

151
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So we could ask our students here, what do you pride yourselves in as a challenge for the website?

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
All right, so why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hello sir, may I help you?

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, I would like some information for requesting a loan.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I see, so let me get this straight.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small portion of the annual interest rate.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This of course is considering that you don't default on a payment.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I have a terrible credit score.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That is a very serious problem, you see.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant information, such as your credit score, in order to approve your loan.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You know what?

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't really need the money.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thanks anyways.

170
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Alright, very good.

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So as you say, saving is important, and well, sometimes, do you think you need a loan?

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I think sometimes people need loans because they want to go into business, for example, so people who want to go into small businesses or open their own companies need startup capital, and so this is a really great example of when people don't have the money lying around and will go to find a bank that will give them a loan.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So yeah, I think it's really important, especially for the economy of a country, for business loans or small business loans to be available because sometimes it's very difficult to find a bank that will actually lend a person money to start a business.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Usually they won't have a problem with lending them money to buy a new car, but to start up a business, it's completely the opposite.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It is, and one of the really popular trends in foreign investment right now is called micro-lending, so micro-loans, and that means that if I want to help people in a very poor country, I can donate, I can lend $100 for someone to buy a sewing machine, or for someone to buy a small computer, $500 for a small computer, and that is a micro-loan.

176
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a very, very small loan for one thing, and that can help them towards their goal of being a business person.

177
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Right, and you're not really getting money out of it, though.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're not charging like 100% interest rate.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You're not.

180
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're charging like 1 or 2% interest, very low interest, and you're giving people a chance to pay the money back because it's such a small amount.

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Wow, that's really good, a really positive thing.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:33,000
