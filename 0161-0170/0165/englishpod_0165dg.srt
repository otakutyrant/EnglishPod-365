EnglishPod.com Hello sir, may I help you?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, I would like some information for requesting a loan.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Very well.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here are the general terms of our loan policies.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I see.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So let me get this straight.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If I borrow, let's say, $10,000, how much will I have to pay each month?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It depends on how long you take to pay it back.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If we lend you $10,000 at an annual interest rate of 10% for 48 months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan, which is called the principal, and another small portion of the annual interest rate.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This, of course, is considering that you don't default on a payment.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It sounds good, but there's just one problem.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have a terrible credit score.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That is a very serious problem, you see.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets, and any other relevant information, such as your credit score, in order to approve your loan.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You know what?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't really need the money.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thanks anyways.
