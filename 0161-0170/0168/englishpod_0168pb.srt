00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And my name is Catherine, and today we have an advanced media level lesson, so that's the very highest of our levels.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And we're going to be talking about a very popular tradition in North America, a Thanksgiving dinner.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, so Thanksgiving is a very special holiday for Americans, and Canadians also celebrate it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But on different dates, right?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Canadians have it on a different date.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Exactly.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In fact, I'm not sure what the Canadian date is, but Americans celebrate it at the end of November.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The day changes every year because it's a Thursday, but we usually have the day off from work or school, and we all eat together and celebrate the year and celebrate the harvest and celebrate our families and friends.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So this tradition of Thanksgiving, what do you commemorate or what do you celebrate?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, we actually celebrate the first harvest that the pilgrims had when they were right off the boat in New England.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So that's the eastern part of America.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
These people had come from England, and they were trying to find a new land and a new life, and they ended up in the Massachusetts area.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And they didn't know how to farm, and they didn't know how to work the land.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And so the Native Americans who were living there at the time helped them out, helped them grow corn, helped them find out how to use the land in a productive way.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And so when that first harvest happened, everyone was able to grow, it was actually a year after they arrived.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Everyone was able to grow corn and food and crops, and then they all shared a meal together to celebrate this wonderful occasion.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And it actually helped them survive the winter because most of the pilgrims, most of the settlers, they died during the first winter, and so this was a really great, great thing for them.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wow.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's really interesting, an interesting aspect of history and why this is celebrated, mostly as you say, in North America and Canada, and that's why many other countries don't really have it.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But it's a popular get-together, and, well, what you usually have is a turkey, right?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Exactly.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So turkey is a very big bird, and they go gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, and they have that kind of really red, long kind of thing on their necks and big tail feathers.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And they're delicious.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But the funny thing is about turkey that there's a chemical in it that makes you very sleepy.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, not a chemical, there's a protein in it that makes you very sleepy.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, really?

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I didn't know that.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So the joke is that after you eat dinner on Thanksgiving, everyone falls asleep on the sofa.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, Thanksgiving meals in the United States are very, very big.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They're very elaborate, right?

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You not only have turkey, but you have pumpkin pie, and you have mashed potatoes and gravy and just, like, a table full of food.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Exactly.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And it's a way to celebrate, well, to give thanks for all the things that you have.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And so we like to cook a lot of food to celebrate that.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And they're all fall foods.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So squash, pumpkin, potatoes, things like that.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
All right.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So we have a dialogue here.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So it's just that.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a guy who is preparing a turkey dinner and also preparing pumpkin pie, but he's doing it in a very peculiar way.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So why don't we listen to the dialogue, and then we'll come back and just talk a little bit about the different terms that he used.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to our show.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Today, we are going to learn how to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I will share a secret that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook the perfect, most mouthwatering, juiciest turkey in the world.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's get started.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
First of all, we must bring out our key ingredient, whiskey.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You see, the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol brings out the flavor of the turkey meat.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's pour one cup of whiskey on the turkey and serve yourself a cup as well.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Cheers.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's good 12-year whiskey right there.

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay, back to our turkey.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now have another cup of whiskey.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a roasting pan.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's add some whiskey to give it some extra flavor.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And let's have another cup.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That hit the spot.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There we go.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We can leave it in there for the next 45 minutes.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In the meantime, let's have another sip of whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin pie.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Lightly whisk together two eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Once that's ready, we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Slowly bring up to simmering point, stirring occasionally.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now you may notice that we are using some dark rum in this pie.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is because the richness of the pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So to celebrate this great occasion, pour yourself a glass.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Cheers.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Now that we have finished with the filling, let's bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes until the filling has puffed up around the edges and the center is almost set.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All done.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A cup of rum to celebrate the completion of this great Thanksgiving dinner.

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,000
After waiting for an hour and having a couple of drinks, it's time to check on our turkey.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Take the turkey out of the oven.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Pick the turkey off of the ground.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving!

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Alright, we're back, so I think this is going to be one great Thanksgiving dinner for him.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh my gosh, and talking about this is making me so hungry.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This always happens when we have food lessons.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What about, do you have any family members who actually drink a little bit too much during Thanksgiving?

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, and I won't say who.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So as he was preparing the Thanksgiving dinner, he mentioned a couple of things.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
For example, a mouth-watering turkey.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mouth-watering, so this is a way to say appetizing.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You know when you see something delicious on TV and your mouth starts to water, you're salivating, that means that your brain is telling you that you want to eat it.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And so your mouth starts to water.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So we say that something that's very appetizing, something that looks like it will taste very very good, is mouth-watering.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Alright, so he was preparing a mouth-watering turkey.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So moving on, he mentioned that he had a key ingredient for his turkey and it was whiskey.

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Not only whiskey, but 12-year whiskey.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay, so the thing about whiskeys is that oftentimes on the label of a bottle they'll advertise how old the whiskey is because you pay more for older whiskeys, they just have a better taste in many cases, well I guess it depends.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In this case it's a 12-year whiskey, that means that it was stored in a cask for 12 years to let it age.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then they sell it after 12 years, and so that's the special ingredient.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's the special ingredient, 12-year whiskey.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And well, he not only put it on the turkey, but also he had a couple of drinks himself and in one of those he mentioned, that hit the spot.

99
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That hit the spot.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What spot?

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The spot!

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Okay, so this is a really common phrase in English that we use to say that something is very satisfying.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So that hit the spot.

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Not only for drinks, right?

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, you could use it for food or anything really.

106
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So in this case, I could say, oh I was so hungry that sandwich really hit the spot.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I really needed to eat right now and that sandwich was perfect.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That was perfect, alright.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So that hit the spot.

110
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Now, when he referred to the turkey, in one occasion he said, we place our bird on a rack.

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So what's a bird and what's the rack?

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay, so this is really interesting.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We talk about the turkey oftentimes when we're making commercials or talking about recipes as the bird.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you want to take out the bird, you want to open the packaging, so the bird is the turkey.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A turkey is a kind of bird.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can say this about chicken as well because it's another kind of bird, but this is kind of a colloquial term in cooking for whatever bird you're cooking.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Right, okay.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And when you're placing it on a rack, what's a rack?

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, so in our ovens, an oven is a kitchen item, appliance, that you have that heats up food.

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But it's not like a microwave, it's much stronger.

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And so inside there are metal bars.

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We don't have, they're like shelves, but they're open.

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And so these metal bars are called a rack.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So you put the turkey in the oven on the rack.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Right, you can't put it on the base of the oven because then it would burn up.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Exactly, and you don't have a shelf because that would be a problem.

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And well, moving on on the instructions when he was preparing the pumpkin pie, he told us to lightly whisk together two eggs.

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So we have a verb here, to whisk.

130
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
To whisk.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So that's not only a verb, but a noun as well, right?

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All right.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's an instrument.

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Exactly.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And this is a verb we often use with eggs.

136
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So to whisk eggs, you can also whisk like sauce for a salad, so like a salad dressing.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But it's a way that we stir something.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And so oftentimes we have an instrument called a whisk that's not like a fork, it actually looks kind of funny.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's got bars on it.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Like wire that kind of make a circle.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Exactly.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And they are very thin wires.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And you usually stir very, very, very quickly, especially if you have eggs.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This will break up the egg and it becomes kind of like foamy.

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Foamy, yeah.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
To make like an omelet, for example.

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Exactly.

148
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So to whisk is a kind of, it's a way to stir.

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And then he mentioned some ingredients such as sugar, spices, and grated nutmeg.

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So what is this verb, grated nutmeg, or an adjective, grated?

151
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Exactly.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So this adjective grated means that it's a kind of way to cut up something.

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And so you often hear the term grated cheese.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That means not a big chunk of cheese, but we push it against a board to get little pieces of it to fall off.

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And that's called grated cheese.

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And so in this case we have grated nutmeg.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That means that it's been kind of, the nutmeg comes in pots.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Very small pieces.

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, pieces.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And we're breaking it down.

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Alright, very good.

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And he also mentioned something about bringing the sauce to a simmering point.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What is that simmering point?

164
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay, simmering point is a time when you're cooking where the liquid goes from being calm to being very agitated and moving.

165
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But it's not boiling, right?

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, boiling means you have big bubbles.

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Right.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Like boiling water.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But simmering is where it's kind of little bubble, there's a little bit of action on the surface of the liquid, but it's not boiling.

170
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's in the middle, between flat and calm, and agitated and boiling.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, so that's the simmering point.

172
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Very good.

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And that's pretty much all of the interesting phrases in the dialogue.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There are a lot more, but we don't really have time to cover that huge amount of rich vocabulary, so why don't we listen to this dialogue one last time?

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome back to our show.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Today, we are going to learn how to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey.

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I will share a secret that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook the perfect, most mouthwatering, juiciest turkey in the world.

178
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's get started.

179
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
First of all, we must bring out our key ingredient, whiskey.

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You see, the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol brings out the flavor of the turkey meat.

181
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's pour one cup of whiskey on the turkey, and serve yourself a cup as well.

182
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Cheers!

183
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ahh, that's good 12 year whiskey right there.

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, back to our turkey.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now have another cup of whiskey.

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a roasting pan.

188
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Let's add some whiskey to give it some extra flavor.

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And let's have another cup.

190
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That hit the spot.

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There we go.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We can leave it in there for the next 45 minutes.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In the meantime, let's have another sip of whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin pie.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Lightly whisk together two eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.

195
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Once that's ready, we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan.

196
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Slowly bring up to simmering point, stirring occasionally.

197
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Now you may notice that we are using some dark rum in this pie.

198
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is because the richness of the pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum.

199
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So to celebrate this great occasion, pour yourself a glass.

200
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Cheers!

201
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Now that we have finished with the filling, let's bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes until the filling has puffed up around the edges and the center is almost set.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All done!

203
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A cup of rum to celebrate the completion of this great Thanksgiving dinner.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
After waiting for an hour and having a couple of drinks, it's time to check on our turkey.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Take the turkey out of the oven.

206
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Pick the turkey off of the ground.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe.

208
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Now also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot.

209
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving!

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Alright, we're back, so Thanksgiving dinner, really popular.

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Catherine have you ever cooked or are you into the whole Thanksgiving feast?

212
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm very into it.

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's my favorite holiday in America, mostly because everyone gets to celebrate it.

214
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's not religious so you don't have to worry about other people not celebrating it or not knowing what to do.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's also a celebration about family and food.

216
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's a wonderful experience to have Thanksgiving because you're with everybody.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We always say in America that if someone doesn't have a place to go on Thanksgiving, you should invite them to your house.

218
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's true.

219
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's a very inviting and warm holiday.

220
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I love cooking and I love being in the kitchen and I love having people in the house cooking.

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I've definitely been a part of the cooking side of things.

222
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Now in many movies, they kind of mock this holiday because it's a time where everyone gets together as you say, no matter religion, creed or race.

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That also causes for a lot of family members to get together and argue and have discussions about politics or talk about family problems and stuff like that.

224
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What do you think of that?

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Well, I think it's an exaggeration but it happens.

226
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
People get very stressed out during the holidays.

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
They call it the holidays because this is beginning where you have Thanksgiving and then later Christmas.

228
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But I personally don't have experience with that really on Thanksgiving because it's such a happy holiday for us.

229
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
In my family, arguments about politics and history and all that is very encouraged.

230
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's just a part of the holiday where we have one person at the table who says this and the other person says this and you're all drinking and it's fun.

231
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I look forward to it.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Very good.

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you guys have any other questions or doubts about this holiday because as we say, it's very common in North America and Canada, you can come to our website EnglishPod.com and if you have any other questions or suggestions, you can leave those there as well.

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We look forward to hearing what you have to say and Happy Thanksgiving.

235
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Happy Thanksgiving.

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Bye everyone.
