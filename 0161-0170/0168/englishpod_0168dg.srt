EnglishPod.com Hello everyone and welcome back to our show.

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,879
Today we are going to learn how to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,160
I will share a secret that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook the perfect, most mouth-watering, juiciest turkey in the world.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,399
Let's get started.

5
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,079
First of all, we must bring out our key ingredient.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:31,940
Whiskey.

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,560
You see, the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol brings out the flavor of the turkey meat.

8
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:42,240
Let's pour one cup of whiskey on the turkey and serve yourself a cup as well.

9
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:43,560
Cheers!

10
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:49,280
That's good 12-year whiskey right there.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,179
Okay, back to our turkey.

12
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,780
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit.

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,899
Now have another cup of whiskey.

14
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:07,019
Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a roasting pan.

15
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,879
Let's add some whiskey to give it some extra flavor.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,620
Let's have another cup.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,500
That hit the spot.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,420
There we go.

19
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:22,760
We can leave it in there for the next 45 minutes.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,019
In the meantime, let's have another sip of whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin pie.

21
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,439
Lightly whisk together two eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.

22
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:48,400
Once that's ready, we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,719
Slowly bring up to simmering point, stirring occasionally.

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,620
Now you may notice that we are using some dark rum in this pie.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,439
This is because the richness of the pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum.

26
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,840
So to celebrate this great occasion, pour yourself a glass.

27
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:08,840
Cheers!

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:23,539
Now that we have finished with the filling, let's bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes until the filling has puffed up around the edges and the center is almost set.

29
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,180
All done!

30
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,360
A cup of rum to celebrate the completion of this great Thanksgiving dinner.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,460
After waiting for an hour and having a couple of drinks, it's time to check on our turkey.

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,740
Take the turkey out of the oven.

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,620
Pick the turkey off of the ground.

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,280
Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe.

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,560
Now also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot.

36
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,419
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving!
