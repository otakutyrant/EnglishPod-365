EnglishPod.com Hello everyone and welcome back to our show.

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today we are going to learn how to cook the perfect Thanksgiving turkey.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I will share a secret that I have kept for over 30 years on how to cook the perfect, most mouth-watering, juiciest turkey in the world.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's get started.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
First of all, we must bring out our key ingredient.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Whiskey.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You see, the grains used to make whiskey along with the alcohol brings out the flavor of the turkey meat.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's pour one cup of whiskey on the turkey and serve yourself a cup as well.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Cheers!

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's good 12-year whiskey right there.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, back to our turkey.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Preheat your oven to 475 degrees Fahrenheit.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now have another cup of whiskey.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now that the oven is hot, we place our bird on a rack inside a roasting pan.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's add some whiskey to give it some extra flavor.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's have another cup.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That hit the spot.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There we go.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We can leave it in there for the next 45 minutes.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
In the meantime, let's have another sip of whiskey and start with our delicious pumpkin pie.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Lightly whisk together two eggs and the extra yolk in a large bowl.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Once that's ready, we can put sugar, spices such as cloves, grated nutmeg, and cinnamon with some cream and dark rum into a saucepan.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Slowly bring up to simmering point, stirring occasionally.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now you may notice that we are using some dark rum in this pie.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is because the richness of the pumpkin is beautifully enhanced by the dark rum.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So to celebrate this great occasion, pour yourself a glass.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Cheers!

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now that we have finished with the filling, let's bake the pie for 45 to 50 minutes until the filling has puffed up around the edges and the center is almost set.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All done!

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A cup of rum to celebrate the completion of this great Thanksgiving dinner.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
After waiting for an hour and having a couple of drinks, it's time to check on our turkey.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Take the turkey out of the oven.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Pick the turkey off of the ground.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't worry, it will add flavor to this recipe.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now also remove the pie from the oven and serve while still hot.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Cheers and Happy Thanksgiving!
