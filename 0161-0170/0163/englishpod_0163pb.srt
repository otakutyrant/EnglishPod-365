00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,519
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,219
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,320
And my name is Catherine and today we're talking about money issues.

4
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:18,679
That's right, so there are some really interesting phrases and we're going to learn a little bit about how money and social security works in the United States.

5
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,260
But before we get into that, why don't we look at vocabulary preview.

6
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:24,739
Vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:33,460
So we're talking about retirement and that means we're going to talk about when you stop working when you're 63 or 65, how do you save money for that?

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,920
And the phrase we've got here is retirement plan.

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,340
Alright, so a retirement plan.

10
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,679
So as you say, that's some money that you have for when you retire, when you're 65, when you're too old maybe to work.

11
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,240
Exactly, and there are many different kinds.

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,560
We're going to hear about one that's called a 401k, but we'll talk about that in a minute.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,740
First, let's listen to today's dialogue.

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,459
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

15
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,420
For sure.

16
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,599
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:13,760
Like what?

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,239
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called the 401k?

19
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:27,459
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

20
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:35,519
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,040
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,099
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

23
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:55,519
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

24
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,219
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:09,219
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

26
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,759
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

27
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,439
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,479
Alright, we're back from today's dialogue now.

29
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:30,520
Some really interesting words and phrases there, and as you said, this 401k, what is a 401k?

30
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:42,300
Well, I'm not sure about the details, honestly, but the 401k plan is a plan for workers, people who are young and working, to invest in their retirement, and so it's a way to save money.

31
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:52,479
So every day, they put a little bit of money towards this plan, and in the end, when they retire, they will have a certain amount of money that they can use throughout their seniorhood.

32
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,860
Exactly, and so before we have that, we have this conversation which starts with a documentary.

33
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:06,740
So they're learning about 401ks, and in this case, the person says that they didn't understand a lot because there was a lot of technical jargon.

34
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,280
Alright, so this word jargon, jargon, it's very similar to slang, right?

35
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,719
Exactly, and it's a special kind of talking or special words related to a certain topic.

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,479
Mm-hmm, or a certain industry.

37
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,259
For example, you hear a lot of business jargon, right?

38
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,560
Or marketing jargon.

39
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:29,379
Yeah, when people start talking about, you know, P.O.P.s and P.O.S.

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,360
and like all that jargon.

41
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:31,039
I lost you, sorry.

42
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,280
No, I don't get that.

43
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:40,280
Well, jargon then is a special language for a certain industry or field, and in this case, we're learning about financial jargon and investment jargon.

44
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,460
So we're talking about 401ks and funds and all that stuff, so.

45
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,819
Okay, very good.

46
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:54,439
And now, when they were talking about the 401k, he explained how they deduct money to put into this plan.

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,800
Well, the question is who deducts money and where does it all go?

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:11,800
And so to deduct means to take away, and this means in a 401k plan, the government will deduct money from your paycheck and put it into a special savings plan for you that you can access when you're retired.

49
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,079
Okay, so to deduct means to take away, to take out, right?

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,699
Exactly, so subtract, deduct, take away, take out.

51
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,519
Very good.

52
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:30,220
All right, and as they kept talking about money issues, the woman said that people in her country distrust banks and financial institutions.

53
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,560
Okay, so you might recognize a word there, distrust, trust.

54
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:43,220
They have the same root, and so to trust someone is to believe in them and to believe what they say, but to distrust means to think what they're saying is a lie.

55
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,480
Okay, so you don't really believe that person.

56
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:54,019
No, so if someone says, trust me, I will take your money and I won't spend it, you say, I distrust this person.

57
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
That means I don't trust.

58
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Right, very good.

59
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,019
And well, why do they distrust these institutions?

60
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,220
Because the government is a bit corrupt.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,779
Okay, so you hear this word a lot in the news or in the newspaper.

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,879
You can have a corrupt government or a corrupt politician.

63
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:15,379
That means that the government does things, but says it doesn't and maybe is dishonest.

64
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,759
It's distrustful.

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Right, so for example, a corrupt politician will support a law that's not really good, but maybe he's being paid by somebody else.

66
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:33,120
Or a corrupt politician will take money from the government institutions to use for himself and not for the country or the people.

67
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:33,819
That's right.

68
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,060
Corrupt, corrupt government then.

69
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,120
Okay, very good.

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,360
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

71
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,680
Well that was an interesting documentary.

72
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:51,660
For sure.

73
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,860
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about Social Security in the US.

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:58,980
Like what?

75
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,220
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

76
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:12,420
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,480
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

78
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,019
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

79
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,019
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

80
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:40,500
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

81
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,199
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

82
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:54,220
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

83
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,699
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,480
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,680
All right, we're back.

86
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,100
On Fluency Builder, we're going to look at three phrases, so let's look at them now.

87
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,360
Fluency Builder.

88
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,220
Okay, this first phrase is what the entire dialogue is about.

89
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,759
It's about putting away money, so to put it away.

90
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Okay, so to put money away, that's an equivalent of saving, right?

91
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,360
Exactly, to save.

92
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,540
So in this case, to put away is a fixed phrase, these words that go together very often, and it means to save.

93
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,959
So you could say, oh yeah, last year I put away $1,000.

94
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,199
Okay, so you saved $1,000.

95
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:40,060
Exactly.

96
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,759
Very good.

97
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,120
And well, why are we putting all this money away?

98
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,379
We're trying to build a nest egg.

99
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,620
Now, this is a funny phrase.

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,300
That is funny.

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,399
A nest is a home for a bird.

102
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,720
You know, it's made of sticks and twigs and leaves.

103
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,060
Right.

104
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,459
And a nest egg then has to do with a bird's eggs.

105
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,459
Eggs in the nest.

106
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,139
Well, I don't know.

107
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,660
I don't know where it comes from, but it does mean money that you've saved up for some date in the future.

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,339
So you could say, I'm trying to grow a nest egg.

109
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,639
I'm trying to build a nest egg so that in 10 years I can buy a house.

110
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Okay.

111
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,779
So it's not only for retirement.

112
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:18,079
You can build a nest egg to possibly invest it in the future and to buying a house.

113
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:18,519
Exactly.

114
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,600
It's your savings that you don't touch.

115
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,839
So I could say, I'm going to kill you.

116
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,220
You spent the nest egg.

117
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:24,720
All right.

118
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,000
That's not for spending.

119
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:26,980
It's for saving.

120
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:27,540
All right.

121
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,620
And well, where can you save money for your nest egg?

122
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,120
It's very popular to put it in a piggy bank.

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Well, maybe if you're five years old, but I don't know if I'd put a lot of money in a piggy bank.

124
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:46,320
Piggy bank is usually a ceramic pig, you know, and it's got a hole in the top and you can put coins in the top.

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,019
So we give these to children to teach them how to save so they can put one penny in every day.

126
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,980
And then when they need the money or they want to spend it, they break the piggy bank.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,600
Exactly.

128
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,519
You have to throw it on the ground.

129
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,480
And it's sad because you realize, oh, now I don't have my pig anymore.

130
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,899
Lost my nest egg.

131
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:03,600
All right.

132
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,840
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again?

133
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,139
Let's keep a look out for all these words and phrases and we'll be back shortly.

134
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:20,320
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

135
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,279
For sure.

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,539
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about Social Security in the U.S.

137
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,620
Like what?

138
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,120
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

140
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,379
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

141
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:56,899
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

142
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,940
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

143
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,460
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it.

144
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,480
So they just invest in properties or things like that.

145
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,100
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

146
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:20,159
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions.

147
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,080
So now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or piggy bank.

148
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,620
No, I've been thinking of doing that lately.

149
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,779
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

150
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:39,980
All right, we're back.

151
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,679
So this whole savings thing, are you good at saving?

152
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,320
Do you have your nest egg planned out for your retirement nest egg?

153
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,259
No, but I'm a compulsive saver.

154
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,980
Really like to save a lot.

155
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,740
Oh, wow.

156
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,679
Yeah, because you never know when you're going to need money.

157
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:10,600
And I think once you get a kind of an adult job, you know, the nine to five job, it's important to spend as little as possible so that you can create a nest egg or some kind of savings account for the future, because it'd be nice to have a car or a house someday.

158
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,259
Right, right.

159
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,039
And also, as you say, unexpected things happen.

160
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,120
So something may happen.

161
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,100
Maybe you you break your arm and you don't have any savings or maybe no insurance.

162
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,480
So at least you have some money stashed away where you can use it.

163
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:24,259
Exactly.

164
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,759
And I know that in America right now in the news, the credit crisis is very popular to talk about.

165
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,740
And so part of this economic situation is that people owe more money than they have.

166
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,139
That means they spent more money than they own.

167
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,419
And so they don't have any savings.

168
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,080
And that really scares me.

169
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,240
So I think it's a really smart idea to start investing as soon as you can.

170
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,259
Very good.

171
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:47,580
All right.
