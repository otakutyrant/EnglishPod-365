00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Catherine and today we're talking about money issues.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right, so there are some really interesting phrases and we're going to learn a little bit about how money and social security works in the United States.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But before we get into that, why don't we look at vocabulary preview.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So we're talking about retirement and that means we're going to talk about when you stop working when you're 63 or 65, how do you save money for that?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And the phrase we've got here is retirement plan.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Alright, so a retirement plan.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So as you say, that's some money that you have for when you retire, when you're 65, when you're too old maybe to work.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Exactly, and there are many different kinds.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We're going to hear about one that's called a 401k, but we'll talk about that in a minute.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
First, let's listen to today's dialogue.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For sure.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Like what?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called the 401k?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Alright, we're back from today's dialogue now.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Some really interesting words and phrases there, and as you said, this 401k, what is a 401k?

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, I'm not sure about the details, honestly, but the 401k plan is a plan for workers, people who are young and working, to invest in their retirement, and so it's a way to save money.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So every day, they put a little bit of money towards this plan, and in the end, when they retire, they will have a certain amount of money that they can use throughout their seniorhood.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Exactly, and so before we have that, we have this conversation which starts with a documentary.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So they're learning about 401ks, and in this case, the person says that they didn't understand a lot because there was a lot of technical jargon.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Alright, so this word jargon, jargon, it's very similar to slang, right?

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Exactly, and it's a special kind of talking or special words related to a certain topic.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mm-hmm, or a certain industry.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For example, you hear a lot of business jargon, right?

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or marketing jargon.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, when people start talking about, you know, P.O.P.s and P.O.S.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and like all that jargon.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I lost you, sorry.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, I don't get that.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, jargon then is a special language for a certain industry or field, and in this case, we're learning about financial jargon and investment jargon.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So we're talking about 401ks and funds and all that stuff, so.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, very good.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And now, when they were talking about the 401k, he explained how they deduct money to put into this plan.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, the question is who deducts money and where does it all go?

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And so to deduct means to take away, and this means in a 401k plan, the government will deduct money from your paycheck and put it into a special savings plan for you that you can access when you're retired.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, so to deduct means to take away, to take out, right?

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Exactly, so subtract, deduct, take away, take out.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Very good.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
All right, and as they kept talking about money issues, the woman said that people in her country distrust banks and financial institutions.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, so you might recognize a word there, distrust, trust.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
They have the same root, and so to trust someone is to believe in them and to believe what they say, but to distrust means to think what they're saying is a lie.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay, so you don't really believe that person.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No, so if someone says, trust me, I will take your money and I won't spend it, you say, I distrust this person.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That means I don't trust.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Right, very good.

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And well, why do they distrust these institutions?

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because the government is a bit corrupt.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay, so you hear this word a lot in the news or in the newspaper.

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can have a corrupt government or a corrupt politician.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That means that the government does things, but says it doesn't and maybe is dishonest.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's distrustful.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right, so for example, a corrupt politician will support a law that's not really good, but maybe he's being paid by somebody else.

66
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Or a corrupt politician will take money from the government institutions to use for himself and not for the country or the people.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Corrupt, corrupt government then.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, very good.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
All right, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well that was an interesting documentary.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For sure.

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about Social Security in the US.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Like what?

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:40,000
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
All right, we're back.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
On Fluency Builder, we're going to look at three phrases, so let's look at them now.

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Fluency Builder.

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, this first phrase is what the entire dialogue is about.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's about putting away money, so to put it away.

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay, so to put money away, that's an equivalent of saving, right?

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Exactly, to save.

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So in this case, to put away is a fixed phrase, these words that go together very often, and it means to save.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So you could say, oh yeah, last year I put away $1,000.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, so you saved $1,000.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Exactly.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Very good.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And well, why are we putting all this money away?

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We're trying to build a nest egg.

99
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Now, this is a funny phrase.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That is funny.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A nest is a home for a bird.

102
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know, it's made of sticks and twigs and leaves.

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And a nest egg then has to do with a bird's eggs.

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Eggs in the nest.

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, I don't know.

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know where it comes from, but it does mean money that you've saved up for some date in the future.

108
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So you could say, I'm trying to grow a nest egg.

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm trying to build a nest egg so that in 10 years I can buy a house.

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So it's not only for retirement.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can build a nest egg to possibly invest it in the future and to buying a house.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Exactly.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's your savings that you don't touch.

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So I could say, I'm going to kill you.

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You spent the nest egg.

117
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
All right.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's not for spending.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's for saving.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And well, where can you save money for your nest egg?

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's very popular to put it in a piggy bank.

123
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well, maybe if you're five years old, but I don't know if I'd put a lot of money in a piggy bank.

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Piggy bank is usually a ceramic pig, you know, and it's got a hole in the top and you can put coins in the top.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So we give these to children to teach them how to save so they can put one penny in every day.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And then when they need the money or they want to spend it, they break the piggy bank.

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Exactly.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You have to throw it on the ground.

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it's sad because you realize, oh, now I don't have my pig anymore.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Lost my nest egg.

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
All right.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue again?

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's keep a look out for all these words and phrases and we'll be back shortly.

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
For sure.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about Social Security in the U.S.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like what?

138
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

139
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So they just invest in properties or things like that.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or piggy bank.

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No, I've been thinking of doing that lately.

149
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't want some banker to run off with my money.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
All right, we're back.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So this whole savings thing, are you good at saving?

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Do you have your nest egg planned out for your retirement nest egg?

153
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, but I'm a compulsive saver.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Really like to save a lot.

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, wow.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, because you never know when you're going to need money.

157
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And I think once you get a kind of an adult job, you know, the nine to five job, it's important to spend as little as possible so that you can create a nest egg or some kind of savings account for the future, because it'd be nice to have a car or a house someday.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Right, right.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And also, as you say, unexpected things happen.

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So something may happen.

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Maybe you you break your arm and you don't have any savings or maybe no insurance.

162
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So at least you have some money stashed away where you can use it.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Exactly.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I know that in America right now in the news, the credit crisis is very popular to talk about.

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so part of this economic situation is that people owe more money than they have.

166
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That means they spent more money than they own.

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And so they don't have any savings.

168
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And that really scares me.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I think it's a really smart idea to start investing as soon as you can.

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Very good.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,000
All right.
