1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:10,060
Well, that was an interesting documentary.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,019
For sure.

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:17,179
I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,359
Like what?

5
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,859
Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401k.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,060
Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,140
Through a 401k, you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the 401k plan.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,659
Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.

9
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,679
That's interesting and logical, I guess.

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:00,200
In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it, so they just invest in properties or things like that.

11
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,840
That seems a bit unstable, don't you think?

12
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:13,819
Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

13
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,359
I've been thinking of doing that lately.

14
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,060
Maybe I don't want some banker to run off with my money.
