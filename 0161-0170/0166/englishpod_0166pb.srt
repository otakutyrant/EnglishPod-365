Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,059
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:11,320
My name is Catherine and today we have an intermediate level lesson talking about appearances.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,519
That's right.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:19,679
We are going to change or somebody wants to change their appearance and they're going to have surgery.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,800
Well before we get started, let's look at what kind of surgery they're having in today's vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:32,380
Vocabulary Preview Alright, so today we're going to be talking about plastic surgery specifically.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,759
Plastic surgery.

9
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,399
So, why plastic?

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,780
I have no idea.

11
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:38,700
Do you know?

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,320
I don't either, no.

13
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:44,359
Well, basically plastic surgery is, you know, surgery for your appearance, right?

14
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:46,399
It's not really for health reasons.

15
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:54,859
That's right and sometimes they add things to you, sometimes they take things away, but they're not for your health, they're not for your heart or your lungs.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,520
It's for your appearance.

17
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,659
And also called cosmetic surgery, right?

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:05,560
That's right and we'll be hearing that later, but cosmetic means having to do with your appearance, like cosmetics.

19
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:06,799
Right, exactly.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,920
Alright, so we're going to be talking about this.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,859
Let's listen to our dialogue for the first time and we'll be back.

22
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,019
Look at me.

24
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,519
I look so old.

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,000
I look as if I were 30.

26
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:25,599
Come on, stop being so vain.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,599
You look great.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,219
You are beautiful.

29
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,659
Yes, I am, but I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

30
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,480
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin, see?

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,739
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

32
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,260
You're 25.

33
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,799
Stop being ridiculous.

34
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:46,519
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

35
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,959
Doesn't look natural.

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:48,939
Whatever.

37
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,920
I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

38
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,540
I think you need to get brain surgery.

39
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,640
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,239
You look amazing.

41
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,060
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,159
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,819
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

44
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,419
You're fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you.

45
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,259
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

46
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,099
Really?

47
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,180
Yeah.

48
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,620
When I got my nose job, I was black and blue for a week.

49
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,199
Alright, we're back.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,580
So, yeah, they think this girl really wants to get this surgery.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,800
But she doesn't seem to know why.

52
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,259
She's just like, I'm in a bad mood.

53
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,300
I want surgery.

54
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,099
That's the worst reason.

55
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,680
And it's pretty painful from what I hear.

56
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,219
Expensive and painful and potentially dangerous.

57
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:41,620
Yeah, exactly.

58
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,759
We can talk about that at the end.

59
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:49,960
Alright, so why don't we start with the words that we saw that are all related to surgery in language takeaway.

60
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,860
Okay, well this first one might be the reason for surgery, not necessarily a kind of surgery.

61
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,460
If someone is vain.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,819
Okay, so if a person is vain, this is an adjective.

63
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,740
That means that they are very, they care too much about their appearance, right?

64
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,199
Right.

65
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,139
And they care so much that they only care about themselves.

66
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,379
So do I look good?

67
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,340
I love my face, my eyes.

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
I look so good.

69
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,060
So a person who is vain thinks very highly of themselves.

70
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,719
Okay, very good.

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,020
And well, this person, I think, wanted to get surgery as well because she said she had wrinkles.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,740
Okay, wrinkles are little lines on your face.

73
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,919
So maybe on your forehead or next to your mouth.

74
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,840
And generally, when we get older, people get more and more of these.

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:50,060
Right, so you would say you have, even you have wrinkly skin when you're in the bathtub for too long and you look in your hands, they look like raisins, you have wrinkly skin.

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,580
That's right, wrinkles are little lines in your skin.

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,560
Alright, and well you have wrinkles, as you said, around your mouth and eyes.

78
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,939
And sometimes, under your eyes, you also have some sagging skin.

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
Or under your chin.

80
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:03,259
Under your chin as well, yeah.

81
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,539
That's right.

82
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,539
So sagging means coming down, means it's heavy.

83
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,659
It's like hanging.

84
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,620
So sagging, something sags, it's heavy, it pulls down.

85
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,939
But if you have sagging skin, that means your skin is no longer tight, it's kind of loose and it hangs.

86
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,980
Falling off your face, okay.

87
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:29,439
And well, a new popular treatment that is not really surgery is this Botox.

88
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,079
That's right.

89
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,620
So Botox is something that women, and some men, do every couple of months, I think, and they have to get shots.

90
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,860
Right, they're like injections.

91
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,959
That's right, and they tighten your skin.

92
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:46,620
And so you can get Botox in your face, so your forehead, or your eyes, and it makes you look younger for a couple of months.

93
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:50,579
I've heard that they also put them in their lips to make them like fuller, right?

94
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,160
That's right.

95
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:57,459
And sometimes you can say that someone's had too much Botox because they can no longer smile.

96
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,500
Or they can't stop smiling.

97
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,180
And well, very related to this is also when people get a facelift.

98
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:20,439
Okay, a facelift, so that means that a doctor, a plastic surgeon, will tighten the skin on your face, so he'll pull your eyes and the skin next to your ears, to make your face look younger.

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,319
Right, so that's called a facelift.

100
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,360
So it's to kind of take away those wrinkles, right?

101
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,500
Or the sagging skin.

102
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:29,579
Right, lift means to pull up, it's the opposite of sag.

103
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:30,439
Very good.

104
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:42,740
All right, so this dialogue has a lot of rich vocabulary related to surgery, so why don't we listen to our dialogue again, and we'll be back with the second part of Language Takeaway to explain a little bit more.

105
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,720
What are you doing?

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,199
Look at me, I look so old.

107
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,660
I look as if I were 30.

108
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,300
Come on, stop being so vain.

109
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,259
You look great.

110
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,899
You are beautiful.

111
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,339
Yes, I am, but I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,160
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin, see?

113
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,420
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

114
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,480
You're 25, stop being ridiculous.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,160
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

116
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,639
It doesn't look natural.

117
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:25,579
Whatever, I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job, and some breast implants as well.

118
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,220
I think you need to get brain surgery.

119
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:31,300
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

120
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,920
You look amazing.

121
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,740
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

122
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,839
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

123
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,519
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

124
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,079
You're fine the way you are, and you have guys drooling all over you.

125
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,920
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

126
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:49,800
Really?

127
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Yeah.

128
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,300
When I got my nose job, I was black and blue for a week.

129
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,160
Alright, we're back.

130
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:01,379
So what other surgical procedure is in store for us?

131
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,579
Well, now the big ones.

132
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,740
So we've left the face, and we're talking about the rest of the body.

133
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,139
Alright.

134
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,040
The first one is a tummy tuck.

135
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:10,199
Okay, so a tummy tuck.

136
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,779
What is that exactly?

137
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,959
Well, let's look at these two words by themselves, because maybe tummy, people have heard before.

138
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,600
This is another way to say stomach.

139
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,660
Usually, children say tummy.

140
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,779
Right, my tummy hurts.

141
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,560
My tummy hurts, and doctors, they'll say stomach.

142
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:31,019
But the name of the surgery is tummy tuck, because tuck means to put in or to fold.

143
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,579
And so my mom used to say, tuck in your shirt.

144
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,939
You know when your shirt comes out of your pants, and that means you put it back in?

145
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,519
Well, a tuck means to fold your stomach under.

146
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,660
It means to make your stomach look smaller, and they put staples, or I think they sew you up.

147
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:45,500
Yeah, they sew you up.

148
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,699
It's pretty painful, right?

149
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,360
I've heard that.

150
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:53,339
Usually, this is because somebody got a liposuction, for example, and that's our next word.

151
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,699
Liposuction.

152
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,379
Okay, lipo, that's kind of fat, right?

153
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:57,779
Yeah.

154
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,600
And suction means to pull, like a vacuum.

155
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:01,519
Right.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,259
So that's basically what they do.

157
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:15,480
They open the person up and kind of use a sort of vacuum type device, and suck all the fat out of the stomach or the balcony areas, you know, the love handles that are also called.

158
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,259
And this way, they remove all this excess fat.

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:29,720
And because they do this, sometimes the skin, since it's been stretched out, because you were a little bit fat, they need to do, they need to have a tummy tuck.

160
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,939
That means to hide the extra skin.

161
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,019
Extra skin, to kind of hide it.

162
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:44,220
So these two words, these two procedures actually go hand in hand, because maybe if you're very fat, you get a liposuction, but that doesn't solve your problem, because now you have all this sagging skin off your stomach.

163
00:08:44,299 --> 00:08:44,759
That's right.

164
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,720
So you have to have a tummy tuck as well.

165
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,039
All right.

166
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:51,980
So yeah, very, very dangerous procedure I've heard as well, right?

167
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,379
And they usually only do it with people who are very, very fat.

168
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,759
That means dangerously fat, because if you do it on a skinny person, you could really hurt them.

169
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,440
Yeah, of course fat is also necessary for our bodies.

170
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:04,460
All right.

171
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:12,740
So now moving back up to the face again, a very common procedure, I think one of the most common ones is a nose job.

172
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,059
A nose job.

173
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,360
And so nose job is very colloquial, you'll hear this on the TV.

174
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,360
Nose job means to fix someone's nose, to change the shape or appearance of their nose.

175
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,460
And so oftentimes people with really big noses want smaller noses.

176
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,500
And so the doctor will take some bone away and will put the skin back.

177
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:35,139
Yes, that's right.

178
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:40,039
So this is called a nose job or formerly known as like a nose surgery, right?

179
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,519
That's right, rhinoplasty is the official name.

180
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,620
And actually I've heard it's very painful because they have to break your nose before they fix it.

181
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,720
Wow.

182
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,039
I can't believe people do this.

183
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:50,960
All right.

184
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:59,120
And well, one of the very common ones among women, most likely, are breast implants.

185
00:09:59,399 --> 00:09:59,700
That's right.

186
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,919
So breast implants.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
Am I allowed to say boob job?

188
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,259
Yeah, you can.

189
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,419
Well, the very common phrase for this is boob job.

190
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:07,740
Right.

191
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,480
Boob is a very colloquial term for breasts.

192
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,299
And breast implants are, well, an implant is something that you put inside something.

193
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,120
Okay.

194
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,820
And so a breast implant is a piece of silicone.

195
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:24,860
So it's like plastic, but it's more like a liquid plastic.

196
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,200
Yeah.

197
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,899
Just imagine like this big plastic bag with like gel right inside of it.

198
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,340
And they put that inside a woman's chest to make her breasts bigger.

199
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,139
And so these are very, very popular surgeries.

200
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:37,919
Breast implants.

201
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,759
Exactly.

202
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:44,320
I guess many models and many, many types, different types of women get breast implants.

203
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:44,700
That's right.

204
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:46,559
And the verb there is to get.

205
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:49,940
So she had, she got breast implants.

206
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,340
Right.

207
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:50,639
Okay.

208
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,379
Because they're things.

209
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,220
Very good.

210
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:52,940
All right.

211
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,919
So why don't we listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

212
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,480
What are you doing?

213
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,460
Look at me.

214
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,980
I look so old.

215
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
I look as if I were 30.

216
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,059
Come on, stop being so vain.

217
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,019
You look great.

218
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,679
You are beautiful.

219
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,019
Yes, I am.

220
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,120
But I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

221
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.

222
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,220
See, I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

223
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
You're 25.

224
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,340
Stop being ridiculous.

225
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,960
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

226
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,460
It doesn't look natural.

227
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,399
Whatever.

228
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,360
I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

229
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,000
I think you need to get brain surgery.

230
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,080
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

231
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,720
You look amazing.

232
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,519
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

233
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,620
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

234
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,320
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

235
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,919
You're fine the way you are, and you have guys drooling all over you.

236
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,720
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

237
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:02,559
Really?

238
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,659
Yeah.

239
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,080
When I got my nose job, I was black and blue for a week.

240
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,059
All right, we're back.

241
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,039
So, as you mentioned, all of these surgeries are very painful and very expensive, right?

242
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:18,799
They are.

243
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,419
The plastic surgery industry is huge.

244
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:27,220
I was just reading an article that said that redos are becoming very popular.

245
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:30,340
There are doctors who perform redos.

246
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:31,179
That means...

247
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:31,980
To redo a surgery.

248
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,480
That's right.

249
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:40,559
They're fixing other surgeries because oftentimes, people go in, they say, I want a nose job, they get a nose job, and then it's not the nose they wanted.

250
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:44,820
They have doctors now who specialize in fixing former surgeries.

251
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,360
Wow.

252
00:12:45,740 --> 00:13:01,919
Yeah, I've heard also a lot about the plastic surgery tourism industry where people get offered a package, for example, to go to countries like Argentina where they have good doctors and it's very inexpensive compared to the States to get plastic surgery.

253
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,440
It's also popular now in Asia, I believe, they're traveling to Hong Kong to get plastic surgery done.

254
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:09,899
Yeah, I know.

255
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,740
But it's one of those things that if you have the money and you really feel that you want to improve your appearance, then you know.

256
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:18,000
But is it an improvement?

257
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,840
I don't know.

258
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:19,480
It is.

259
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:19,980
It's a little fake.

260
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,940
Yeah, it is a little bit fake.

261
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,019
Like for example, but it does help people with their self-confidence, right?

262
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:33,620
Sometimes for example, with the case of breast implants, some women feel very, very self-conscious about them having smaller breasts.

263
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,480
They want to get bigger breasts and they feel more confident, happier, and you know, stuff like this.

264
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:42,299
So I guess if it helps and if you really want it, you know, everyone's to their own.

265
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:45,919
Well, I'm curious what our users think about this.

266
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,460
Have you had plastic surgery?

267
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,000
Would you like to have plastic surgery?

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,299
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

269
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,559
Right.

270
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,360
We'll see you guys there.

271
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:52,980
Until next time.

272
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:53,299
Bye.

273
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,580
Bye.
