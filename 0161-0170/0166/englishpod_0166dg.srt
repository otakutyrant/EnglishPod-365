EnglishPod.com What are you doing?

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,880
Look at me, I look so old.

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,359
I look as if I were 30.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,980
Come on, stop being so vain.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:13,939
You look great.

6
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,580
You are beautiful.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,019
Yes I am, but I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,339
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:21,839
See?

10
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,100
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,600
You're 25.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,160
Stop being ridiculous.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,859
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,359
It doesn't look natural.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,259
Whatever, I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

16
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,899
I think you need to get brain surgery.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,979
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,640
You look amazing.

19
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:50,439
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

20
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,520
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

21
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:57,179
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

22
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,799
You're fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you.

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:03,619
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,459
Really?

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,959
Yeah, when I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week.
