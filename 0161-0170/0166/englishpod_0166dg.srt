EnglishPod.com What are you doing?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look at me, I look so old.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I look as if I were 30.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Come on, stop being so vain.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You look great.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You are beautiful.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes I am, but I think it's time for some plastic surgery.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm tired of these wrinkles and sagging skin.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
See?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't see any wrinkles or sagging skin.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You're 25.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stop being ridiculous.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Besides, I think that people who get Botox, have facelifts or tummy tucks look weird.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It doesn't look natural.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Whatever, I think I'm going to get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think you need to get brain surgery.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I honestly don't think you need cosmetic surgery.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You look amazing.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I thought you were my friend and would support me on this.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You don't need plastic surgery to do that.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're fine the way you are and you have guys drooling all over you.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Plus, plastic surgery hurts.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Really?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, when I got my nose job I was black and blue for a week.
