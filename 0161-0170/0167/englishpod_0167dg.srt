00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, I'm ready for my driving lesson.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Should I start the car?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hold on there, Fiddy Paldi.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First, let's go over things one more time.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now, before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Next, check your rear-view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We've been through this a million times.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's get going already.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm ready.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Fine.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Start the car.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Okay, now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There we go.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Good.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm doing it.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm driving.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is awesome.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's turn some music on.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Keep your eyes on the road.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No music.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We are coming up to a red light.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Step on the brakes.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you doing?

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I said the brakes.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Look out for those people.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Get off the sidewalk.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Get out of my way.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is just like playing video games.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's the police.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Pull over.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They'll never take me alive.
