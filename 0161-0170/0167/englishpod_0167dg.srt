00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:11,640
EnglishPod.com Okay, I'm ready for my driving lesson.

2
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:12,580
Should I start the car?

3
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,640
Hold on there, Fiddy Paldi.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,140
First, let's go over things one more time.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:24,480
Now, before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,300
Next, check your rear-view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

7
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,780
We've been through this a million times.

8
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:32,039
Let's get going already.

9
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:32,659
I'm ready.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,619
Fine.

11
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:34,659
Start the car.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,020
Okay, now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,179
Good.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,060
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,119
There we go.

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:46,700
Good.

17
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm doing it.

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:48,479
I'm driving.

19
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,799
This is awesome.

20
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,420
Let's turn some music on.

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:52,820
Keep your eyes on the road.

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,820
No music.

23
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:55,939
We are coming up to a red light.

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,240
Step on the brakes.

25
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,039
What are you doing?

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,060
I said the brakes.

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,799
Look out for those people.

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,799
Get off the sidewalk.

29
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,299
Get out of my way.

30
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:07,760
This is just like playing video games.

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,159
It's the police.

32
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,099
Pull over.

33
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,799
They'll never take me alive.
