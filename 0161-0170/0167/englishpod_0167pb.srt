00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And my name is Catherine and today we're going on a little driving lesson.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right, we're going to learn how to drive, but not only how to drive, but all the vocabulary and words associated to this activity.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and we'll be back to explain it.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay I'm ready for my driving lesson, should I start the car?

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hold on there, fiddy paldi.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
First let's go over things one more time.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We've been through this a million times, let's get going already, I'm ready!

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Fine, start the car.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Good.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There we go, good.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm doing it, I'm driving.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is awesome.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's turn some music on.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Keep your eyes on the road.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No music.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We are coming up to a red light.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Step on the brakes.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you doing?

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I said the brakes!

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Look out for those people!

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Get off the sidewalk!

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Get out of my way!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is just like playing video games.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's the police!

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Pull over!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
They'll never take me alive!

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright great, so it's a great driving lesson just like the video games.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Exactly, well hopefully not like video games, we don't want to hurt anyone, but that comes a little bit later.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
First let's check out some of these very important phrases in today's Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright so on Language Takeaway we have five words for you today.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Starting with the first one, the steering wheel.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, steering wheel, so this comes from the fact that we have a wheel that we use to turn the car left and right.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And so that's called to steer, to change the direction of something.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the verb to steer is to take it left or right.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Exactly, so steering wheel is the instrument that we use to change the car's direction.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Very good, and well apart from this instrument, also in order to look to other cars that are behind you, you would look at your rear view mirror.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Great so rear view mirror, this is a mirror that you have in front of you in the middle of the car, and you look at this mirror to find out if there are cars behind you.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So it's a rear view, that means you're looking at the back, rear means back or behind.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What about the mirrors that are on the side of the car, on the doors?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Those are called side view mirrors.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Side view mirrors.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Very literal.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, very good.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And well moving on, he was instructing her on how to drive, and he said step on the clutch.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well this is an important word for those of you who are driving manual cars.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That means that you have to control the way that the gas goes into the engine by yourself.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And so a clutch is a pedal, it's the third pedal on the left, and you push this pedal to change gears.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So some cars they don't have this.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
For those of you who don't, don't worry about it.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But if you do, a clutch is on the far left, it's the third pedal.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, so this is for a manual car, manual transmission car, because many people have automatics, where you just accelerate and the car automatically changes gears.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Exactly, and so a lot of Europeans drive manual cars and have this clutch.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, so you step on the clutch, and in order to change gear, you say to shift into first gear.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right, because if you're driving, you know that you can't go from first to fifth gear, right?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There's four or five gears, and so you have to go one, two, three, four, five, you have to go in order.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So we're shifting, we're moving up, or we're moving down.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So that's called to shift.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All right, to shift.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And now in the dialogue, we heard to shift into first gear.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that's what it's called.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Exactly.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And so normally the car starts in N, neutral, that was when you're at a break, you're at a stop.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And if you want to start the car, you have to shift to first gear, and that's the lowest that's going to help the car go.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, so to shift into first gear.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Awesome vocabulary.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think this is really useful, especially because it's very specific, so you don't really see it very often in anywhere, but sometimes you need to use it.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right, and it's especially useful if you're trying to teach someone how to drive.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, because not everyone knows how to drive manual.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Exactly.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, so why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to explain Fluency Builder.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, I'm ready for my driving lesson.

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Should I start the car?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hold on there, fiddy paldi.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
First let's go over things one more time.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We've been through this a million times.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's get going already.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm ready.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Fine, start the car.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Good.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There we go.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm doing it.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm driving.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is awesome.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's turn some music on.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Keep your eyes on the road.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No music.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We are coming up to a red light.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Step on the brakes.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I said the brakes.

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Look out for those people.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Get off the sidewalk.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Get out of my way.

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, this is just like playing video games.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's the police.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Pull over.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They'll never take me alive.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,000
All right, we're back.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases in Fluency Builder.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, the first phrase is maybe the most important when driving.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's the first thing you do.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You start the car.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
All right, so you don't say you turn on the car, right?

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, so you put the key in the ignition and you start the car.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That means you, you know, you turn it on.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What about when you want to turn off the car?

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Turn the car off.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You say stop the engine.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Stop the car.

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stop the car.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Stop the engine.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Stop the engine, right?

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right, very good.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Moving on, our next phrase is a million times.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why is this a phrase?

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A million times.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's pretty literal, right?

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We've been through this a million times.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Well, no, it's not literal.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Otherwise, I think I might kill the person because a million times means that we've had this same conversation many, many, many times.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But you can't actually have it a million times.

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's way too many.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So it's an exaggeration.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, it's a way to say a lot.

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So I've heard him say this a million times.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've heard this story a million times.

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Or I've done this.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I've turned the car on a million times.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Awesome.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And now, well, they were driving and they heard a police siren and the guy told her to pull over.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, so this is a very common car phrase again, especially when you're dealing with the police.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So to pull over means to slow the car down and to stop it on the side of the road.

146
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So you could hear a policeman say, pull over.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So pull over your car.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That means slow down and stop the car on the side because obviously you can't stop in the middle of the road.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So sometimes your mobile phone will ring as well and you don't have a hands-free, so you have to pull over to the side so you can pick up the phone usually, right?

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Or you could say, hey mom, could you pull over?

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have to use the restroom.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Awesome.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
All right.

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And our last phrase for today is to take me alive, to take someone alive.

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They'll never take me alive.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's what the character says.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And so this is a phrase that we use when we're talking about people who are running away from the law.

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So he says, they'll never capture me.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And if they do, I'll be dead.

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So he's saying either I run free or I die.

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So to take someone alive is basically that.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But is it literal?

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Would you say?

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, this is not literal.

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's saying, they'll never catch me.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
OK.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Very good.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All right.

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So that's all the phrases we have for today.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,000
OK.

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm ready for my driving lesson.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Should I start the car?

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hold on there, Fittipaldi.

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
First, let's go over things one more time.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We've been through this a million times.

181
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's get going already.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm ready.

183
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Fine.

184
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Start the car.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
OK.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Good.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There we go.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Good.

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm doing it.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm driving.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is awesome.

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's turn some music on.

195
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Keep your eyes on the road.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No music.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We are coming up to a red light.

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Step on the brakes.

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you doing?

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I said the brakes.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Look out for those people.

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Get off the sidewalk.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Get out of my way.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is just like playing video games.

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's the police.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Pull over.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They'll never take me alive.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
All right.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We're back.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So driving now.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is interesting because as you mentioned, a lot of people in America usually have automatic transmissions, whereas in Europe, maybe they have manual transmissions.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Exactly.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is there a reason for that, do you think?

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not sure what the reason would be.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I think a lot of American car makers manufacture more automatic cars in general.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Some people say that it's because people in America are less concerned with gas, but if you have a manual transmission, you can actually conserve a bit of gas.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And so because gas prices in Europe are higher generally, more people are interested in having manual transmissions.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Also, I remember when I was younger, my dad always bought cars that had a manual transmission because he said that if ever they break down, it's much easier and cheaper to fix a car that has a manual transmission than it is to fix an automatic one.

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, and I personally think that it's better to learn how to drive on a manual transmission car because you can drive any car afterwards.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But if you learn an automatic, you'll never know how to drive a manual.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There was also a case on television recently about a small child that, actually the dialogue is based on it, is he took his dad's car and he was like seven years old and he was driving and was being chased by the police.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No way.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then he pulled into his house and got out of the car and ran into the house.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So obviously he was an underage driver, but he didn't get into much trouble.

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But it was interesting because he drove very, very well.

227
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's unbelievable.

228
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And basically almost learned it by game simulators, by video games on how you drive on a video game.

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, wow.

230
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, NASCAR, here he comes.

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Right.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
