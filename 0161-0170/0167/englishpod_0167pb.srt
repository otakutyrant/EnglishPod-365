00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:05,919
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,199
And my name is Catherine and today we're going on a little driving lesson.

3
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:18,100
That's right, we're going to learn how to drive, but not only how to drive, but all the vocabulary and words associated to this activity.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,260
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time and we'll be back to explain it.

5
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,380
Okay I'm ready for my driving lesson, should I start the car?

6
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,420
Hold on there, fiddy paldi.

7
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:40,920
First let's go over things one more time.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,259
Now before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

9
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,100
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,460
We've been through this a million times, let's get going already, I'm ready!

11
00:00:57,219 --> 00:00:58,500
Fine, start the car.

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,799
Okay now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:04,980
Good.

14
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,859
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,500
There we go, good.

16
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,260
I'm doing it, I'm driving.

17
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,579
This is awesome.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,200
Let's turn some music on.

19
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,599
Keep your eyes on the road.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:17,620
No music.

21
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,760
We are coming up to a red light.

22
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,079
Step on the brakes.

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,840
What are you doing?

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,819
I said the brakes!

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,599
Look out for those people!

26
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,560
Get off the sidewalk!

27
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,079
Get out of my way!

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,519
This is just like playing video games.

29
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:32,939
It's the police!

30
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:33,900
Pull over!

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,620
They'll never take me alive!

32
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,719
Alright great, so it's a great driving lesson just like the video games.

33
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:52,859
Exactly, well hopefully not like video games, we don't want to hurt anyone, but that comes a little bit later.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,659
First let's check out some of these very important phrases in today's Language Takeaway.

35
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,760
Alright so on Language Takeaway we have five words for you today.

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,039
Starting with the first one, the steering wheel.

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:17,240
Okay, steering wheel, so this comes from the fact that we have a wheel that we use to turn the car left and right.

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,219
And so that's called to steer, to change the direction of something.

39
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,099
So the verb to steer is to take it left or right.

40
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,319
Exactly, so steering wheel is the instrument that we use to change the car's direction.

41
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:38,780
Very good, and well apart from this instrument, also in order to look to other cars that are behind you, you would look at your rear view mirror.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:49,300
Great so rear view mirror, this is a mirror that you have in front of you in the middle of the car, and you look at this mirror to find out if there are cars behind you.

43
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:54,539
So it's a rear view, that means you're looking at the back, rear means back or behind.

44
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,740
What about the mirrors that are on the side of the car, on the doors?

45
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,860
Those are called side view mirrors.

46
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:01,740
Side view mirrors.

47
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,340
Very literal.

48
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,599
Okay, very good.

49
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:11,340
And well moving on, he was instructing her on how to drive, and he said step on the clutch.

50
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,979
Well this is an important word for those of you who are driving manual cars.

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,840
That means that you have to control the way that the gas goes into the engine by yourself.

52
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:30,639
And so a clutch is a pedal, it's the third pedal on the left, and you push this pedal to change gears.

53
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:31,340
Okay.

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,860
So some cars they don't have this.

55
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,759
For those of you who don't, don't worry about it.

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,860
But if you do, a clutch is on the far left, it's the third pedal.

57
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:48,800
Okay, so this is for a manual car, manual transmission car, because many people have automatics, where you just accelerate and the car automatically changes gears.

58
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,580
Exactly, and so a lot of Europeans drive manual cars and have this clutch.

59
00:03:54,199 --> 00:04:00,939
Okay, so you step on the clutch, and in order to change gear, you say to shift into first gear.

60
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,819
That's right, because if you're driving, you know that you can't go from first to fifth gear, right?

61
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:14,639
There's four or five gears, and so you have to go one, two, three, four, five, you have to go in order.

62
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,879
So we're shifting, we're moving up, or we're moving down.

63
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,279
So that's called to shift.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,420
All right, to shift.

65
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,560
And now in the dialogue, we heard to shift into first gear.

66
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
So that's what it's called.

67
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:27,480
Exactly.

68
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:32,939
And so normally the car starts in N, neutral, that was when you're at a break, you're at a stop.

69
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:40,500
And if you want to start the car, you have to shift to first gear, and that's the lowest that's going to help the car go.

70
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:42,899
Okay, so to shift into first gear.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,339
Awesome vocabulary.

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,420
I think this is really useful, especially because it's very specific, so you don't really see it very often in anywhere, but sometimes you need to use it.

73
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,139
That's right, and it's especially useful if you're trying to teach someone how to drive.

74
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,079
Yeah, because not everyone knows how to drive manual.

75
00:04:59,439 --> 00:04:59,920
Exactly.

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,160
Okay, so why don't we listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to explain Fluency Builder.

77
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,079
Okay, I'm ready for my driving lesson.

78
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,019
Should I start the car?

79
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,060
Hold on there, fiddy paldi.

80
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,579
First let's go over things one more time.

81
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:23,879
Now before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

82
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,740
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

83
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,199
We've been through this a million times.

84
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,480
Let's get going already.

85
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:32,100
I'm ready.

86
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,079
Fine, start the car.

87
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,779
Okay, now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

88
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:39,939
Good.

89
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,860
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

90
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:44,879
There we go.

91
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:45,459
Good.

92
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm doing it.

93
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,240
I'm driving.

94
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,560
This is awesome.

95
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,120
Let's turn some music on.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,579
Keep your eyes on the road.

97
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:52,620
No music.

98
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,720
We are coming up to a red light.

99
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,060
Step on the brakes.

100
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,800
What are you doing?

101
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:58,839
I said the brakes.

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,579
Look out for those people.

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,519
Get off the sidewalk.

104
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,040
Get out of my way.

105
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,519
Oh, this is just like playing video games.

106
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,920
It's the police.

107
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:08,879
Pull over.

108
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,660
They'll never take me alive.

109
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,680
All right, we're back.

110
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,600
So now why don't we take a look at four key phrases in Fluency Builder.

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,040
Well, the first phrase is maybe the most important when driving.

112
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,240
It's the first thing you do.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,740
You start the car.

114
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,079
All right, so you don't say you turn on the car, right?

115
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:30,779
No.

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,199
No, so you put the key in the ignition and you start the car.

117
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,319
That means you, you know, you turn it on.

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,000
What about when you want to turn off the car?

119
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,920
Turn the car off.

120
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:42,579
You say stop the engine.

121
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,500
Stop the car.

122
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,300
Stop the car.

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,500
Stop the engine.

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,319
Stop the engine, right?

125
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:47,560
All right, very good.

126
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,740
Moving on, our next phrase is a million times.

127
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,620
Why is this a phrase?

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,620
A million times.

129
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,699
It's pretty literal, right?

130
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,860
We've been through this a million times.

131
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,339
Well, no, it's not literal.

132
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:07,379
Otherwise, I think I might kill the person because a million times means that we've had this same conversation many, many, many times.

133
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,019
But you can't actually have it a million times.

134
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,620
That's way too many.

135
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,839
So it's an exaggeration.

136
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,680
Yeah, it's a way to say a lot.

137
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,600
So I've heard him say this a million times.

138
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,740
I've heard this story a million times.

139
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,759
Or I've done this.

140
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,759
I've turned the car on a million times.

141
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,199
Okay.

142
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,300
Awesome.

143
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,720
And now, well, they were driving and they heard a police siren and the guy told her to pull over.

144
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Okay, so this is a very common car phrase again, especially when you're dealing with the police.

145
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,779
So to pull over means to slow the car down and to stop it on the side of the road.

146
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,240
So you could hear a policeman say, pull over.

147
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,180
So pull over your car.

148
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,439
That means slow down and stop the car on the side because obviously you can't stop in the middle of the road.

149
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:52,779
Right.

150
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,480
So sometimes your mobile phone will ring as well and you don't have a hands-free, so you have to pull over to the side so you can pick up the phone usually, right?

151
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,879
Or you could say, hey mom, could you pull over?

152
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,920
I have to use the restroom.

153
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:05,139
Awesome.

154
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:05,839
All right.

155
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:10,699
And our last phrase for today is to take me alive, to take someone alive.

156
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,819
They'll never take me alive.

157
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,259
That's what the character says.

158
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,439
And so this is a phrase that we use when we're talking about people who are running away from the law.

159
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,199
So he says, they'll never capture me.

160
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,139
And if they do, I'll be dead.

161
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,079
So he's saying either I run free or I die.

162
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:29,759
All right.

163
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,820
So to take someone alive is basically that.

164
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,840
But is it literal?

165
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,639
Would you say?

166
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,320
No, this is not literal.

167
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,139
He's saying, they'll never catch me.

168
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,600
OK.

169
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,220
Very good.

170
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,139
All right.

171
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:42,120
So that's all the phrases we have for today.

172
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,440
Why don't we listen to this dialogue for the last time and we'll be back.

173
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:55,740
OK.

174
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,159
I'm ready for my driving lesson.

175
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:58,120
Should I start the car?

176
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,159
Hold on there, Fittipaldi.

177
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,700
First, let's go over things one more time.

178
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, before you even think of starting the car, make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly.

179
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,840
Next, check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly.

180
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,320
We've been through this a million times.

181
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,600
Let's get going already.

182
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,179
I'm ready.

183
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:19,139
Fine.

184
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,200
Start the car.

185
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,200
OK.

186
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,559
Now gently step on the clutch and shift to first gear.

187
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:26,700
Good.

188
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:30,580
Now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it.

189
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,659
There we go.

190
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,240
Good.

191
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,259
I'm doing it.

192
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,019
I'm driving.

193
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,340
This is awesome.

194
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,899
Let's turn some music on.

195
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:38,360
Keep your eyes on the road.

196
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,379
No music.

197
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
We are coming up to a red light.

198
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,779
Step on the brakes.

199
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,580
What are you doing?

200
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:45,519
I said the brakes.

201
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,340
Look out for those people.

202
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,360
Get off the sidewalk.

203
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,840
Get out of my way.

204
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,279
This is just like playing video games.

205
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,700
It's the police.

206
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:55,639
Pull over.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,419
They'll never take me alive.

208
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,960
All right.

209
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:07,360
We're back.

210
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,419
So driving now.

211
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:17,120
This is interesting because as you mentioned, a lot of people in America usually have automatic transmissions, whereas in Europe, maybe they have manual transmissions.

212
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:17,899
Exactly.

213
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,080
Is there a reason for that, do you think?

214
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,759
I'm not sure what the reason would be.

215
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:26,840
I think a lot of American car makers manufacture more automatic cars in general.

216
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:36,320
Some people say that it's because people in America are less concerned with gas, but if you have a manual transmission, you can actually conserve a bit of gas.

217
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:42,559
And so because gas prices in Europe are higher generally, more people are interested in having manual transmissions.

218
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:59,379
Also, I remember when I was younger, my dad always bought cars that had a manual transmission because he said that if ever they break down, it's much easier and cheaper to fix a car that has a manual transmission than it is to fix an automatic one.

219
00:10:59,659 --> 00:10:59,879
That's right.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,820
Well, and I personally think that it's better to learn how to drive on a manual transmission car because you can drive any car afterwards.

221
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:11,480
But if you learn an automatic, you'll never know how to drive a manual.

222
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:24,100
There was also a case on television recently about a small child that, actually the dialogue is based on it, is he took his dad's car and he was like seven years old and he was driving and was being chased by the police.

223
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:24,820
No way.

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,340
And then he pulled into his house and got out of the car and ran into the house.

225
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:33,720
So obviously he was an underage driver, but he didn't get into much trouble.

226
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,299
But it was interesting because he drove very, very well.

227
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,159
That's unbelievable.

228
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:43,580
And basically almost learned it by game simulators, by video games on how you drive on a video game.

229
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,059
Oh, wow.

230
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,620
Well, NASCAR, here he comes.

231
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,659
Right.

232
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,179
