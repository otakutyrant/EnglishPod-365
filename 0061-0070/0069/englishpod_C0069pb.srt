00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:03,359
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,099
We are here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:05,820
My name is Marco.

5
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:06,780
And I'm Erika.

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,320
And today we're going to be bringing you a lesson about eggs.

7
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:10,300
That's right.

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,580
And who knew there was so much to talk about when we're talking eggs?

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,039
Right.

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,399
Well, we always have eggs for breakfast, and there are many ways of preparing them.

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,280
So we're going to learn what the different ways are.

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:23,719
Yes.

13
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:27,600
And we'll learn some of the language that goes along with eggs.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,179
Okay.

15
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,859
So we have three words that we want to take a look at before we listen to our dialogue.

16
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:34,560
So let's look at these in Vocabulary Preview.

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,280
Our preview word for this lesson is picky.

18
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,200
Picky.

19
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:41,920
Picky.

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,640
Picky.

21
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,740
So picky is an interesting adjective.

22
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:46,960
Okay.

23
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,060
So if a person is picky, what does that mean?

24
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:51,060
They're very hard to please.

25
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,240
Okay.

26
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,200
So if your boss is picky, and you give him a report, and maybe it has, I don't know, a couple of mistakes or something.

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,640
Yeah, he'll say, do it again.

28
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:02,600
Change this, this, and this.

29
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,060
Okay.

30
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,340
So if you are picky, you want everything to be perfect.

31
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,959
Okay.

32
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,180
And if there's one small thing that's not, you won't be happy.

33
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:12,920
Okay.

34
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,540
So picky.

35
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,579
Interesting word.

36
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,219
Now our next word, yolk.

37
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:19,579
Yolk.

38
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,319
Yolk.

39
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,500
Y-O-L-K.

40
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:22,920
Yolk.

41
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,180
So this word is actually not in the dialogue.

42
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,280
It's not in the dialogue, but it's important that you know, right?

43
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:29,579
Okay.

44
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,680
So if you have an egg, the yellow part is called the yolk.

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,359
Okay.

46
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,700
And what about the other part?

47
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,560
The white.

48
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,400
The white.

49
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:40,099
The white.

50
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,939
Or also called the egg white, right?

51
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Yes.

52
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:42,840
Egg white.

53
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:43,560
Okay.

54
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,439
So pretty simple.

55
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,859
Yolk and egg white.

56
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,420
Let's listen to our dialogue.

57
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,459
We are going to be listening to a couple who are having breakfast.

58
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:05,140
Wow.

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,219
You're up early today.

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,180
What's for breakfast?

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,979
Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.

62
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,319
Smells good.

63
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll make some coffee.

64
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,039
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

65
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:15,819
Sure.

66
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,219
I'll take mine sunny side up.

67
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,219
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

68
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,599
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

69
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,800
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

70
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:29,740
It drove my mom crazy.

71
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,259
You know what really drives me crazy?

72
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,300
When I ask for soft boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard boiled.

73
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:38,680
How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

74
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,340
You're so picky sometimes.

75
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,759
Here you go, honey.

76
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:52,580
Fried eggs.

77
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:53,599
Damn it.

78
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,159
I said sunny side up.

79
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

80
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,500
Well, she is definitely very picky and has a very bad temper.

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,379
I know.

82
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,580
I can't believe anyone would get so angry over their breakfast.

83
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,860
But I guess it is the most important meal of the day.

84
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:17,560
Exactly.

85
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,840
So we heard a couple of different ways of describing how you prepare eggs.

86
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:24,500
So let's take a look at that in language takeaway.

87
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,460
Language takeaway.

88
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:32,199
OK, so our first preparation method.

89
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,180
My favorite.

90
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,000
All right.

91
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,240
Sunny side up.

92
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,479
OK, sunny side up.

93
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,500
Sunny side up.

94
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:40,840
Now, this is interesting.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Sunny like the sun, right?

96
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:42,460
Exactly.

97
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,580
So when you fry an egg.

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:45,599
Right.

99
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,939
And the yolk looks like a little sun, right?

100
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,780
Yeah, exactly.

101
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,139
So why is it called sunny side up?

102
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,500
I think because of what you just said.

103
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,560
It looks like the sun.

104
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,419
But you don't cook the yolk.

105
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:56,780
OK.

106
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,240
Yeah, the yolk is still yellow.

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,740
It's still a little bit liquid.

108
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,979
It's a little bit soft.

109
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,800
OK, because the opposite would be a fried egg.

110
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,259
Yes.

111
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,039
And that's our second word.

112
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,080
Fried egg.

113
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,300
Fried egg.

114
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,460
So this you put the egg in the pan and you cook it all the way through.

115
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:15,979
All the way through.

116
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,060
So the yolk is not liquid anymore.

117
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,000
It becomes hard.

118
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,920
Yes, right.

119
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,360
Exactly.

120
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:20,879
OK.

121
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,060
A fried egg.

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:22,860
Fried egg.

123
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:23,480
All right.

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,740
So now let's take a look at our next set of eggs.

125
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,379
All right.

126
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,120
A soft boiled egg.

127
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,500
A soft boiled egg.

128
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:31,620
Soft boiled.

129
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,879
Soft boiled.

130
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,660
OK, so to boil, you put the egg.

131
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,920
In water.

132
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,420
In boiling water.

133
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,560
Yes, and make it cook.

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,540
And make it cook.

135
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,939
So how long would you usually put it in for to be soft boiled?

136
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,100
Three minutes.

137
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:46,699
Four minutes.

138
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:47,220
OK.

139
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,319
So you only cook part of the egg, right?

140
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,319
The yolk, the yellow part, stays a little bit wet.

141
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,600
A little bit liquid.

142
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,839
OK.

143
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,420
So again, the opposite would be?

144
00:04:58,699 --> 00:04:59,839
A hard boiled egg.

145
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,860
Hard boiled egg.

146
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:01,360
Hard boiled.

147
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,860
So hard boiled is when you cook the entire egg again.

148
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,180
Yes.

149
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,939
So then it's hard like a ball.

150
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,860
The entire egg.

151
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,879
So with this soft boiled and hard boiled eggs, this takes us to our next form.

152
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,360
Eggs and soldiers.

153
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,000
Eggs and soldiers.

154
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:18,839
Eggs and soldiers.

155
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,699
Eggs and soldiers.

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,180
Now this is really interesting.

157
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,759
I didn't really know about this before.

158
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,759
It kind of sounds like you're having eggs with a group of soldiers from the army.

159
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,759
Well, this is a very British way of eating eggs.

160
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,139
So you have your soft boiled egg in a cup, and you have a piece of toast.

161
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,939
But the toast is cut into long pieces.

162
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:43,500
OK.

163
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,879
And then you take those pieces and you dip them into the egg yolk.

164
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,939
It's delicious.

165
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,620
It's good.

166
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,660
Typical English way of eating eggs.

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,360
So eggs and soldiers.

168
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,000
Interesting.

169
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,639
And this takes us to our last form of egg preparation and probably the most popular.

170
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,259
Scrambled eggs.

171
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,240
Scrambled eggs.

172
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,120
Scrambled eggs.

173
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,199
Take eggs, put them in a pan.

174
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,379
And then you just move them all over the place.

175
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,120
Mix them all up.

176
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,620
Mix them all up.

177
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,500
So the yellow, so the yolk and the white are mixed together.

178
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,079
Mixed together.

179
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:15,259
All right.

180
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,519
So we've looked at a lot of egg preparation, and now we can listen to our dialogue for the second time.

181
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,860
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

182
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,939
Wow, you're up early today.

183
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,519
What's for breakfast?

184
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,639
Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.

185
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,620
Smells good.

186
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,560
I'll make some coffee.

187
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,180
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

188
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:53,660
Sure, I'll take mine sunny side up.

189
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,120
Ew, I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

190
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,839
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

191
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,920
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

192
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,879
It drove my mom crazy.

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
You know what really drives me crazy?

194
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,259
When I asked for soft-boiled eggs, and they overcook them so they come out hard-boiled.

195
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,399
How can you dip your toast into a hard-boiled egg?

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,540
You're so picky sometimes.

197
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,339
Here you go, honey.

198
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:28,560
Fried eggs.

199
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:32,259
Damn it, I said sunny side up.

200
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,060
How many times do I have to tell you?

201
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,480
Interesting that the man in this dialogue is the one doing the baking.

202
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,480
Yeah, well, that's modern days.

203
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,459
I don't know, men are learning how to cook and yeah.

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,420
A house husband.

205
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,160
House husbands, yeah, more popular these days.

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,980
All right, well, since this house husband felt like baking, I think we should look at this and one other phrase in Fluency Builder.

207
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,199
Okay, so great phrase.

208
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,040
He said, I felt like baking.

209
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,600
I felt like baking.

210
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:06,839
I felt like baking.

211
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,639
So let's take a look at this.

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,459
He feels like or he felt like in the past.

213
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,319
What does that mean when you feel like?

214
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,480
You want to do it.

215
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,379
You have the desire to do it.

216
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:18,379
Okay, and then to bake.

217
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,959
And now this verb is in the gerund form.

218
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,199
That's right, the ing form.

219
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,060
And that's the rule, right?

220
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,839
I feel like playing soccer.

221
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,139
Right, I feel like eating lunch.

222
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:34,799
I felt like going to the movies.

223
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,620
That's the way you would say this.

224
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,960
You have the desire, you feel like doing something.

225
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:39,759
Exactly.

226
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,240
Okay, very good.

227
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,080
And now let's take a look at this second phrase.

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,220
Drives me crazy.

229
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,179
Drives me crazy.

230
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,080
Drives me crazy.

231
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,539
All right, this is a very, very descriptive phrase.

232
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,200
And I think if we listen to some examples, it will help us understand the meaning.

233
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,559
Example one.

234
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,879
This music is driving me crazy.

235
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,019
Turn it down.

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,679
Example two.

237
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,440
Don't leave garbage in my car.

238
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,779
It drives me crazy.

239
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,820
Example three.

240
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,960
Your mom is driving me crazy.

241
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:23,659
She keeps calling me.

242
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,639
All right, so if something drives you crazy.

243
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,279
It makes you feel very angry or annoyed.

244
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,179
Irritated.

245
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,120
Yeah, frustrated.

246
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,899
Okay, but it can also be positive, right?

247
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,960
Like that girl drives me crazy.

248
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,179
As in you really, really, really like her.

249
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,559
I don't know, it sounds a little bit inappropriate.

250
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,120
Really?

251
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,980
I think it's okay.

252
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,259
She's got me thinking and she's got me in the clouds or something like that.

253
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,159
All right, well maybe there's something about you that I don't need to know.

254
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,840
So I'll just let you keep that thought to yourself.

255
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,379
All right, well I'm just saying we could use it in a positive form as well.

256
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,820
Okay, okay, you're just saying.

257
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,039
I'm just saying.

258
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:07,220
All right, so drives me crazy.

259
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:11,639
Really great phrase and you can use it in all of these different situations like we heard.

260
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,940
So let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,960
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

262
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,419
Wow, you're up early today.

263
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:29,340
What's for breakfast?

264
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:33,159
Well, I felt like baking so I made some muffins.

265
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,480
Smells good.

266
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,679
I'll make some coffee.

267
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,200
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

268
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,360
Sure, I'll take mine sunny side up.

269
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,220
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

270
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,720
Ever since I was small I've had eggs and soldiers.

271
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,980
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

272
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,919
It drove my mom crazy.

273
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,419
You know what really drives me crazy?

274
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,539
When I ask for soft-boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard-boiled.

275
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,860
How can you dip your toast into a hard-boiled egg?

276
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,580
You're so picky sometimes.

277
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,759
Here you go honey, fried eggs.

278
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:15,759
Damn it!

279
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
I said sunny side up.

280
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,120
How many times do I have to tell you?

281
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,919
Well, I think there are some people who really, really love eating eggs for breakfast and some people who just can't stand it.

282
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,799
Yeah, I don't know who though.

283
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,519
I mean who doesn't like eggs in the morning?

284
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,600
I know I'm a big fan.

285
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,379
Eggs, bacon, toast.

286
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:39,820
Yes.

287
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,480
Good stuff.

288
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:43,480
Traditional American type breakfast.

289
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,840
Now you were telling me that you have some traditions when you eat eggs.

290
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,539
I know, I think I'm not sure if this is just in my family but I think actually it might be common with other people as well.

291
00:11:54,419 --> 00:12:03,980
When you eat a soft-boiled or hard-boiled egg, you have to eat all of the egg outside of the shell and then you have to break the bottom of the shell after you finished.

292
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:04,659
Why?

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,360
So that the fairies who live in your egg cup can come out.

294
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,440
So it's kind of like a superstition.

295
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,840
Yeah, I guess it is.

296
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,879
Yeah, so I don't know.

297
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:20,200
You guys, do you have any egg traditions or any other crazy food stories like that?

298
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:37,720
Well, for example, I was telling you that when I prepare scrambled eggs, sometimes I like to take some rice, some rice that has already been cooked, put it in the pan and then take some eggs, two eggs, put it on top of the rice and scramble the rice with the eggs.

299
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, for breakfast?

300
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,720
Yeah, it could be for breakfast.

301
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:46,279
A little bit, not like a huge plate of rice or maybe at night you don't have anything to eat.

302
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,179
Scrambled eggs with rice.

303
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:49,440
It's a poor man's food.

304
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,559
All right.

305
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,259
Well, it's also a quick man's food.

306
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,100
Yeah, exactly.

307
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:01,100
So let us know if you guys have any egg preparations or any special egg recipes or traditions that you practice.
