00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We are here at EnglishPod.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erika.

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And today we're going to be bringing you a lesson about eggs.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And who knew there was so much to talk about when we're talking eggs?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Right.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, we always have eggs for breakfast, and there are many ways of preparing them.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So we're going to learn what the different ways are.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And we'll learn some of the language that goes along with eggs.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So we have three words that we want to take a look at before we listen to our dialogue.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So let's look at these in Vocabulary Preview.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Our preview word for this lesson is picky.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Picky.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Picky.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Picky.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So picky is an interesting adjective.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So if a person is picky, what does that mean?

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They're very hard to please.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So if your boss is picky, and you give him a report, and maybe it has, I don't know, a couple of mistakes or something.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, he'll say, do it again.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Change this, this, and this.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Okay.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So if you are picky, you want everything to be perfect.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And if there's one small thing that's not, you won't be happy.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So picky.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Interesting word.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now our next word, yolk.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yolk.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yolk.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Y-O-L-K.

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yolk.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So this word is actually not in the dialogue.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not in the dialogue, but it's important that you know, right?

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So if you have an egg, the yellow part is called the yolk.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And what about the other part?

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The white.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The white.

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The white.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Or also called the egg white, right?

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Egg white.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So pretty simple.

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yolk and egg white.

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's listen to our dialogue.

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We are going to be listening to a couple who are having breakfast.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wow.

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're up early today.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's for breakfast?

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Smells good.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll make some coffee.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sure.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll take mine sunny side up.

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It drove my mom crazy.

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know what really drives me crazy?

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When I ask for soft boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard boiled.

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How can you dip your toast into a hard boiled egg?

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're so picky sometimes.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Here you go, honey.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Fried eggs.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Damn it.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I said sunny side up.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, she is definitely very picky and has a very bad temper.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I can't believe anyone would get so angry over their breakfast.

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But I guess it is the most important meal of the day.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Exactly.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So we heard a couple of different ways of describing how you prepare eggs.

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So let's take a look at that in language takeaway.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Language takeaway.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OK, so our first preparation method.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My favorite.

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
All right.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sunny side up.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
OK, sunny side up.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sunny side up.

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, this is interesting.

95
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sunny like the sun, right?

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Exactly.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So when you fry an egg.

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Right.

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And the yolk looks like a little sun, right?

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, exactly.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So why is it called sunny side up?

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think because of what you just said.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It looks like the sun.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But you don't cook the yolk.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
OK.

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah, the yolk is still yellow.

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's still a little bit liquid.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's a little bit soft.

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
OK, because the opposite would be a fried egg.

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And that's our second word.

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Fried egg.

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Fried egg.

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So this you put the egg in the pan and you cook it all the way through.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All the way through.

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So the yolk is not liquid anymore.

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It becomes hard.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes, right.

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Exactly.

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
OK.

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
A fried egg.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Fried egg.

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right.

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So now let's take a look at our next set of eggs.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
All right.

126
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
A soft boiled egg.

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A soft boiled egg.

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Soft boiled.

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Soft boiled.

130
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
OK, so to boil, you put the egg.

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In water.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
In boiling water.

133
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, and make it cook.

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And make it cook.

135
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So how long would you usually put it in for to be soft boiled?

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Three minutes.

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Four minutes.

138
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
OK.

139
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So you only cook part of the egg, right?

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The yolk, the yellow part, stays a little bit wet.

141
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A little bit liquid.

142
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
OK.

143
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So again, the opposite would be?

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A hard boiled egg.

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hard boiled egg.

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hard boiled.

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So hard boiled is when you cook the entire egg again.

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So then it's hard like a ball.

150
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The entire egg.

151
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So with this soft boiled and hard boiled eggs, this takes us to our next form.

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Eggs and soldiers.

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Eggs and soldiers.

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Eggs and soldiers.

155
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Eggs and soldiers.

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Now this is really interesting.

157
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't really know about this before.

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It kind of sounds like you're having eggs with a group of soldiers from the army.

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, this is a very British way of eating eggs.

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So you have your soft boiled egg in a cup, and you have a piece of toast.

161
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But the toast is cut into long pieces.

162
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OK.

163
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And then you take those pieces and you dip them into the egg yolk.

164
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's delicious.

165
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's good.

166
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Typical English way of eating eggs.

167
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So eggs and soldiers.

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Interesting.

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And this takes us to our last form of egg preparation and probably the most popular.

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Scrambled eggs.

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Scrambled eggs.

172
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Scrambled eggs.

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Take eggs, put them in a pan.

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And then you just move them all over the place.

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mix them all up.

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mix them all up.

177
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So the yellow, so the yolk and the white are mixed together.

178
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mixed together.

179
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All right.

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So we've looked at a lot of egg preparation, and now we can listen to our dialogue for the second time.

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And then we'll come back and look at some phrases.

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wow, you're up early today.

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What's for breakfast?

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, I felt like baking, so I made some muffins.

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Smells good.

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll make some coffee.

187
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sure, I'll take mine sunny side up.

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ew, I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ever since I was small, I've had eggs and soldiers.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It drove my mom crazy.

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know what really drives me crazy?

194
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When I asked for soft-boiled eggs, and they overcook them so they come out hard-boiled.

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How can you dip your toast into a hard-boiled egg?

196
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're so picky sometimes.

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Here you go, honey.

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Fried eggs.

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Damn it, I said sunny side up.

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

201
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Interesting that the man in this dialogue is the one doing the baking.

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah, well, that's modern days.

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know, men are learning how to cook and yeah.

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
A house husband.

205
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
House husbands, yeah, more popular these days.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All right, well, since this house husband felt like baking, I think we should look at this and one other phrase in Fluency Builder.

207
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, so great phrase.

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He said, I felt like baking.

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I felt like baking.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I felt like baking.

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So let's take a look at this.

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He feels like or he felt like in the past.

213
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What does that mean when you feel like?

214
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You want to do it.

215
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You have the desire to do it.

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, and then to bake.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And now this verb is in the gerund form.

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right, the ing form.

219
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And that's the rule, right?

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I feel like playing soccer.

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Right, I feel like eating lunch.

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I felt like going to the movies.

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's the way you would say this.

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You have the desire, you feel like doing something.

225
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Exactly.

226
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, very good.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And now let's take a look at this second phrase.

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Drives me crazy.

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Drives me crazy.

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Drives me crazy.

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
All right, this is a very, very descriptive phrase.

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And I think if we listen to some examples, it will help us understand the meaning.

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Example one.

234
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This music is driving me crazy.

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Turn it down.

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Example two.

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't leave garbage in my car.

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It drives me crazy.

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Example three.

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Your mom is driving me crazy.

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
She keeps calling me.

242
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right, so if something drives you crazy.

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It makes you feel very angry or annoyed.

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Irritated.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yeah, frustrated.

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay, but it can also be positive, right?

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Like that girl drives me crazy.

248
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
As in you really, really, really like her.

249
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't know, it sounds a little bit inappropriate.

250
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Really?

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think it's okay.

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
She's got me thinking and she's got me in the clouds or something like that.

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
All right, well maybe there's something about you that I don't need to know.

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So I'll just let you keep that thought to yourself.

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
All right, well I'm just saying we could use it in a positive form as well.

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay, okay, you're just saying.

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm just saying.

258
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
All right, so drives me crazy.

259
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Really great phrase and you can use it in all of these different situations like we heard.

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Wow, you're up early today.

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What's for breakfast?

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, I felt like baking so I made some muffins.

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Smells good.

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll make some coffee.

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Do you want me to make you some eggs?

268
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Sure, I'll take mine sunny side up.

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know how you can eat your eggs like that.

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ever since I was small I've had eggs and soldiers.

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You know, my dad had scrambled eggs every morning for 20 years.

272
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It drove my mom crazy.

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know what really drives me crazy?

274
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When I ask for soft-boiled eggs and they overcook them so they come out hard-boiled.

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How can you dip your toast into a hard-boiled egg?

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're so picky sometimes.

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Here you go honey, fried eggs.

278
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Damn it!

279
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I said sunny side up.

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

281
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, I think there are some people who really, really love eating eggs for breakfast and some people who just can't stand it.

282
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, I don't know who though.

283
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I mean who doesn't like eggs in the morning?

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know I'm a big fan.

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Eggs, bacon, toast.

286
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yes.

287
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Good stuff.

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Traditional American type breakfast.

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Now you were telling me that you have some traditions when you eat eggs.

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know, I think I'm not sure if this is just in my family but I think actually it might be common with other people as well.

291
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:03,000
When you eat a soft-boiled or hard-boiled egg, you have to eat all of the egg outside of the shell and then you have to break the bottom of the shell after you finished.

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why?

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So that the fairies who live in your egg cup can come out.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So it's kind of like a superstition.

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah, I guess it is.

296
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, so I don't know.

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You guys, do you have any egg traditions or any other crazy food stories like that?

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, for example, I was telling you that when I prepare scrambled eggs, sometimes I like to take some rice, some rice that has already been cooked, put it in the pan and then take some eggs, two eggs, put it on top of the rice and scramble the rice with the eggs.

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, for breakfast?

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Yeah, it could be for breakfast.

301
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
A little bit, not like a huge plate of rice or maybe at night you don't have anything to eat.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Scrambled eggs with rice.

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a poor man's food.

304
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
All right.

305
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, it's also a quick man's food.

306
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So let us know if you guys have any egg preparations or any special egg recipes or traditions that you practice.
