00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com This is ridiculous.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How could you do this?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You know what?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm out of here.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Wait!

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Doctor, how is this possible?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I have something to confess.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry, Veronica.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I lied.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Wait, what?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What do you mean?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I lied.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You aren't even pregnant.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's no body in the oven.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Veronica, I love you!

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Who are you?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's me, Daniel.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't you remember me from high school?

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I sat behind you in science class.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You're insane.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We never even spoke.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Because, Veronica, it's not fair.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love you.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I have since the first day we met.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You will be mine now, one way or another.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Get your hands off of her.
