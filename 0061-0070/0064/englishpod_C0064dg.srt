00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:09,080
EnglishPod.com This is ridiculous.

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,939
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:13,160
How could you do this?

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,740
You know what?

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,660
I'm out of here.

6
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:16,140
Wait!

7
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,480
Doctor, how is this possible?

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,760
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,440
I have something to confess.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,500
I'm sorry, Veronica.

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:30,839
I lied.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,600
Wait, what?

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,039
What do you mean?

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,159
I lied.

15
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,619
You aren't even pregnant.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,420
There's no body in the oven.

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,280
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

18
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,759
Veronica, I love you!

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,020
What are you talking about?

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,439
Who are you?

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,619
It's me, Daniel.

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,859
Don't you remember me from high school?

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
I sat behind you in science class.

24
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,599
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,319
You're insane.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,359
We never even spoke.

27
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:12,760
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,379
Because, Veronica, it's not fair.

29
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:18,120
I love you.

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,079
I have since the first day we met.

31
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,180
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

32
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,200
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

33
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,180
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

34
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:41,260
You will be mine now, one way or another.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,719
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

36
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,280
Get your hands off of her.
