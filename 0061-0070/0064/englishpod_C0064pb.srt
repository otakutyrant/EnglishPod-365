00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,139
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:05,919
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:06,940
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,539
And today we're bringing you, again, the great series, I'm Sorry I Love You, Part 6.

6
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,359
The newest installment in the EnglishPod soap opera.

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:19,079
Drama, romance.

8
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:21,559
Love, tragedy.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,219
All of it here at EnglishPod and in our series.

10
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:29,280
So today we have a really great dialogue.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,560
I just can't believe what's happening here.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,119
But before we get into it, we need to preview one word.

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:36,840
That's right.

14
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:39,659
So let's take a look at it in vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,219
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,939
Well, we're going to preview this word, sleeping with.

17
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:48,179
Sleeping with.

18
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,299
Sleeping with someone.

19
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:50,840
Sleeping with him.

20
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,539
Yes.

21
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,259
So it seems pretty easy.

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,259
I mean, sleeping with, it just sounds like you are in bed with somebody.

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,820
Yeah, but you are doing a little bit more than sleeping.

24
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:03,500
All right.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:12,200
So so in English, this phrase actually means that you are involved with someone and have an intimate sexual relationship, right?

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,079
Yes, you are in a relationship with someone and you are having sex.

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:16,840
Exactly.

28
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:24,560
So be careful how you use it, because I know that sometimes you want to translate and just say, well, they are in the same bed together, but it's not that they're having sex.

29
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,000
Right.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,299
So most of the time in English, the phrase sleeping with means sex.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:30,780
Right.

32
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:31,359
OK.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,200
Sleeping with.

34
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,060
Be careful.

35
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:33,540
OK.

36
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Well, let's find out.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,120
Why are we talking about sleeping with?

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,620
Well, obviously somebody is sleeping with somebody.

39
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,739
So let's listen to the dialogue and then we'll come back and talk about.

40
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,359
This is ridiculous.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,219
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

42
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,439
How could you do this?

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,000
You know what?

44
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,920
I'm out of here.

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,379
Wait.

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,740
Doctor, how is this possible?

47
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,020
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

48
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,719
I have something to confess.

49
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,780
I'm sorry, Veronica.

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,099
I lied.

51
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:20,099
Wait.

52
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:20,879
What?

53
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,300
What do you mean?

54
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,419
I lied.

55
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:24,900
You aren't even pregnant.

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,680
There's no body in the oven.

57
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,520
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,039
Veronica, I love you.

59
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,319
What are you talking about?

60
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:38,139
Who?

61
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,699
Who are you?

62
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,039
It's me, Daniel.

63
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,180
Don't you remember me from high school?

64
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,039
I sat behind you in science class.

65
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,879
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,580
You are insane.

67
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:55,639
We never even spoke.

68
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,020
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

69
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,620
Because Veronica, it's not fair.

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,379
I love you.

71
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,379
I have since the first day we met.

72
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,460
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

73
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,479
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

74
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,439
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

75
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,560
You will be mine now, one way or another.

76
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,960
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

77
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,520
Get your hands off of her.

78
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:47,979
Scandal, again.

79
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,280
Oh, this poor Veronica and Steven.

80
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:55,819
I just don't know how their relationship could get more complicated.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,659
It's amazing.

82
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,199
They're having an amazing adventure in their love life.

83
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm sure glad my love life looks nothing like this.

84
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:04,860
All right.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,979
So we saw some really great words.

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
So let's take a look at them in Language Takeaway.

87
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:12,780
Language Takeaway.

88
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,360
The words we're looking at now are about feelings.

89
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,439
And so let's take a look at the first one.

90
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,019
Confess.

91
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:22,740
Okay.

92
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:23,899
Confess.

93
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,199
To confess.

94
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:26,540
To confess.

95
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,180
So confess, what does that mean?

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,519
When you confess something, you tell a secret that you've been hiding.

97
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,120
Okay.

98
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,959
So that's pretty easy.

99
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,100
So you have a secret and you want to tell it to someone, so you are confessing.

100
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,980
Yeah, and it's usually something negative.

101
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:42,420
Oh, okay.

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,519
So Marco, I confess that I stole five dollars from you.

103
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,540
Oh, you did?

104
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,360
Yeah, sorry.

105
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,120
Oh, okay.

106
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,660
No wonder my wallet was lighter.

107
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,399
Yeah.

108
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,000
All right.

109
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,399
So confess.

110
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,160
I shall not forgive you for this.

111
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,399
Oh, no.

112
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,040
All right.

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,060
Let's take a look at our next word.

114
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Overwhelmed.

115
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:03,759
Overwhelmed.

116
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,279
I am overwhelmed.

117
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,300
So when I am overwhelmed, I am filled with emotion.

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,759
Okay, with emotion.

119
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,899
It can be good emotions and bad emotions, right?

120
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,759
Yeah, but you just feel too much.

121
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,000
It's like you're going to explode.

122
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:19,939
Okay.

123
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,220
I am overwhelmed with joy.

124
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,720
Yes, or I'm overwhelmed with work.

125
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,800
And I am overwhelmed with jealousy.

126
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,199
Like this guy.

127
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:31,800
Right?

128
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,360
And that's our third word.

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,399
Jealousy.

130
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,240
Jealousy.

131
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,579
So this is interesting because jealousy is the noun.

132
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:40,279
That's right.

133
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:43,759
It's the feeling of being jealous.

134
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,160
Which is the adjective.

135
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,459
Which is the adjective.

136
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,540
So what does it mean when you are jealous?

137
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:55,699
It means that you see somebody and you want what they have.

138
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:56,399
Okay.

139
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,800
You want what they have.

140
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:58,060
Yeah.

141
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,500
So in this case, the doctor is jealous of Veronica's boyfriend because the doctor wants Veronica.

142
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:05,379
Okay.

143
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:06,079
Jealous.

144
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,879
So Erica, are you a jealous wife?

145
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,100
I don't know.

146
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
Maybe a little bit.

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,540
A little bit.

148
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,240
But I've never gone to the extent of telling someone that they're pregnant.

149
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,240
All right.

150
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,399
Jealousy.

151
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,439
Okay.

152
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,560
And let's take a look at our next two words which are actually kind of insults, right?

153
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,899
Yeah, they're not very kind words at all.

154
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:32,259
Okay.

155
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,740
But you've got to learn them anyways.

156
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:34,759
Okay.

157
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,939
Let's take a look at this one.

158
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:36,959
Jerk.

159
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:37,819
Jerk.

160
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,120
He's a jerk.

161
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,199
J-E-R-K.

162
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:40,839
Jerk.

163
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,399
Jerk.

164
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:44,620
So what does it mean if someone is a jerk?

165
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,879
A stupid and mean person.

166
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,439
Plain as simple as that.

167
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,500
Stupid and mean.

168
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,339
So can a woman be a jerk?

169
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:59,860
It's mostly male but now it's becoming more common to use with women as well.

170
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,319
Okay, so I can say he is a jerk or she is a jerk.

171
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,920
Yeah, but it is more common for men.

172
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,379
Okay.

173
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,199
And now let's take a look at our last word.

174
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,740
You lying bastard.

175
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,660
Bastard.

176
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:12,920
Bastard.

177
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,579
Bastard.

178
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,959
Wow, this is pretty strong as well.

179
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,620
Yeah, you've got to be careful about this one.

180
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,420
This one is almost a swear word.

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,600
Almost.

182
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,899
Like on the line.

183
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,220
Yeah.

184
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,740
So what does it mean if you call someone a bastard?

185
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,339
Well, literally it means your mother and father were not married when you were born.

186
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,740
When you were born, exactly.

187
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,360
So it is a pretty big insult.

188
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:35,779
Yes.

189
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,120
A little bit, I guess.

190
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,800
But it doesn't really, really mean that your mother and father weren't married.

191
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,160
It means that you are a jerk.

192
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:46,720
You're a jerk.

193
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,120
You're a really big jerk.

194
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,100
You're a mean person.

195
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,259
A really mean person.

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,060
So jerk isn't as strong as a bastard.

197
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,199
Yes, bastard is stronger.

198
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,339
Okay, so you've got to be careful when you throw that word in there or how you would use it.

199
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,800
And again, it's for men, right?

200
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:00,459
Not for women.

201
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,199
Yeah, you can't use this word with women.

202
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,920
Oh, okay.

203
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,279
There's another one out there, but that will have to wait for another English pod.

204
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,060
Well, apparently all of these words are just for men.

205
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,079
What did we do wrong?

206
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,560
Marco, I can't begin to tell you.

207
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,000
Okay.

208
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,560
Okay, so let's listen to our dialogue again and then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

209
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,220
This is ridiculous.

210
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,059
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

211
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,299
How could you do this?

212
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:33,860
You know what?

213
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,799
I'm out of here.

214
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:35,940
Wait.

215
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,279
Doctor, how is this possible?

216
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,559
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

217
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,259
I have something to confess.

218
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,299
I'm sorry, Veronica.

219
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,639
I lied.

220
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,419
Wait, what?

221
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:55,860
What do you mean?

222
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,980
I lied.

223
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,440
You aren't even pregnant.

224
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:00,240
There's no body in the oven.

225
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:04,909
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

226
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Veronica, I love you.

227
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,820
What are you talking about?

228
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,240
Who are you?

229
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,600
It's me, Daniel.

230
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,679
Don't you remember me from high school?

231
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,539
I sat behind you in science class.

232
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,419
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

233
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,139
You were insane.

234
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,179
We never even spoke.

235
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,559
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

236
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,179
Because, Veronica, it's not fair.

237
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,940
I love you.

238
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,899
I have since the first day we met.

239
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:47,039
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

240
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,059
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

241
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,980
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

242
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,120
You will be mine now, one way or another.

243
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,320
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

244
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,159
Get your hands off of her.

245
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,580
All right, so great stuff.

246
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,720
Jerk, bastards, all that good words going around.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,799
But we've also got some amazing phrases.

248
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,379
So why don't we take a look at those now in Fluency Builder.

249
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,559
Fluency Builder.

250
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:29,399
All right, so in Fluency Builder today, we have three great phrases.

251
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,659
Let's take a look at the first one.

252
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,840
Bun in the oven.

253
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,860
A bun in the oven.

254
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,259
A bun in the oven.

255
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,139
Okay, this is obvious.

256
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,000
It's obviously an idiomatic phrase, right?

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,919
Well, it could be literal as well, right?

258
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,139
Like you could actually have a piece of bread in your oven.

259
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,059
Bun is a piece of bread in the oven.

260
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,419
But in this context, we're not using it.

261
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,120
No, it means you're pregnant.

262
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:51,820
You're pregnant.

263
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,320
So the baby is the bun.

264
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,919
Yeah, and the oven is your stomach.

265
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,019
Right, so you say she has a bun in the oven.

266
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,139
Yes, she's pregnant.

267
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,960
She's pregnant.

268
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:00,779
Okay.

269
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:05,500
It could be difficult to understand if you don't really have the explanation, right?

270
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:05,759
Yes.

271
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,899
You would say, what?

272
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,519
She has bread in the oven?

273
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:08,940
Yeah.

274
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,100
A bun in the oven.

275
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:10,539
Okay.

276
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,879
Now let's take a look at the second one.

277
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,000
Couldn't help myself.

278
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,659
I couldn't help myself.

279
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,700
I couldn't help myself.

280
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,360
So when you can't help yourself, you can't control yourself.

281
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,019
Right.

282
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,019
You did something, but you couldn't control it.

283
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:28,980
You couldn't stop it.

284
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:29,940
You couldn't stop it.

285
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:37,379
Okay, so let's listen to some examples of how you would use, I couldn't help myself because it's a phrase that you can use in many different ways, right?

286
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:37,919
That's right.

287
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,620
Let's listen.

288
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,320
Example one.

289
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,659
I just couldn't help myself when I saw your car.

290
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:46,299
I just had to buy it.

291
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:48,860
Example two.

292
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,460
I'm sorry.

293
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,799
I couldn't help myself.

294
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
I just started laughing.

295
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,159
Example three.

296
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,600
The cake was so good.

297
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,259
I couldn't help myself.

298
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,639
I ate it all.

299
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,240
All right.

300
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:10,559
Perfect.

301
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,639
Couldn't help myself.

302
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,139
Easy.

303
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:22,919
Now, the doctor, he couldn't help himself from lying to Veronica because he was angry that her boyfriend, Stephen, came into the picture.

304
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,960
Came into the picture.

305
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:26,720
To come into the picture.

306
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,159
Okay, so what does it mean when somebody comes into the picture?

307
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,080
Well, basically, you appear in somebody's life.

308
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
You come into somebody's life.

309
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,500
So imagine that your life is a picture and somebody all of a sudden comes into it, so?

310
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,679
They come into the picture.

311
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:44,679
They come into your life.

312
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,600
Come into your life.

313
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:45,940
Yes.

314
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:50,899
So he's angry that Stephen appeared into Veronica's life and they're in love and all that stuff, right?

315
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,059
Yeah.

316
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:51,759
All right.

317
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,860
Well, these are some great phrases and why don't we listen to them again in context?

318
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,720
So let's listen to the dialogue.

319
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,279
This is ridiculous.

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,120
I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else.

321
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,360
How could you do this?

322
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:14,940
You know what?

323
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,860
I'm out of here.

324
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,320
Wait.

325
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:23,679
Doctor, how is this possible?

326
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,960
I haven't cheated on my boyfriend.

327
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,700
I have something to confess.

328
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,700
I'm sorry, Veronica.

329
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,059
I lied.

330
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,019
Wait.

331
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,799
What?

332
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,220
What do you mean?

333
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,320
I lied.

334
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:39,820
You aren't even pregnant.

335
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,620
There's no bun in the oven.

336
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,460
I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself.

337
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,919
Veronica, I love you.

338
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,240
What are you talking about?

339
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,659
Who are you?

340
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,019
It's me, Daniel.

341
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,059
Don't you remember me from high school?

342
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,960
I sat behind you in science class.

343
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,799
I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad.

344
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,539
You're insane.

345
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:10,559
We never even spoke.

346
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,940
Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?

347
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,580
Because, Veronica, it's not fair.

348
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:19,320
I love you.

349
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,320
I have since the first day we met.

350
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,379
Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything.

351
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:32,379
I went to med school and became a doctor for you.

352
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,360
You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor.

353
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,480
You will be mine now, one way or another.

354
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,899
I heard everything, you lying bastard.

355
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,639
Get your hands off of her.

356
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:59,620
Okay, so Veronica's not pregnant.

357
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,539
That was a close one.

358
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,519
Actually, they're not married.

359
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,460
So this is a very controversial topic, right?

360
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,580
Being knocked up.

361
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,179
Yes, nice phrase.

362
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:09,940
Nice phrase.

363
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:16,179
So there's a lot of interesting phrases and ways you can talk about pregnancy.

364
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:18,080
So if you're knocked up, you're pregnant.

365
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,519
Right, so you could hear that in movies.

366
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,960
It's not really, I would say, a proper way of saying it.

367
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,399
No, it's not that polite because it gives you the idea that it was a mistake.

368
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:29,980
Right.

369
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,879
So you would say, she got knocked up.

370
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:34,220
Yes.

371
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,600
Another common phrase is preggers.

372
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:38,460
Preggers.

373
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:40,659
I heard this is more Australian, right?

374
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:42,539
She's preggers, so she's pregnant.

375
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,080
So it's actually a pretty interesting topic.

376
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:56,860
I know that, for example, in Latin America, if a girl that's maybe in her early 20s gets pregnant accidentally by her boyfriend, usually the families expect them to get married.

377
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,299
Really?

378
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:01,120
Yeah, so it's kind of like, should they get married, should they not?

379
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,259
So there's a lot of pressure.

380
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,559
A lot of pressure.

381
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,480
But it's different in other countries, right?

382
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,879
So, I don't know, for you guys, what's it like in your country where you live?

383
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,919
Is there pressure on the guy and the girl to get married?

384
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,220
I mean, should Steven and Veronica get married in this situation?

385
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,299
Or what about just living together?

386
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,539
Or as they say, living in sin, right?

387
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:22,840
Living in sin.

388
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,120
Living together, living in sin.

389
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,279
So is it okay to just live together with your girlfriend?

390
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,159
Or should you get married before?

391
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,039
This is a controversial topic, so we'll have a lot of different opinions.

392
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,460
But it should be interesting.

393
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:35,860
Yes.

394
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,820
