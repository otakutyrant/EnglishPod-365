1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back, English learners.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Marco and I'm joined here by the lovely Erica.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,460
And today we're going to be bringing you another great lesson, one of the lessons that you requested.

4
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:12,300
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,119
Actually, Maxim, Maxim S requested this one.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:15,759
Right.

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,739
I think he's really into research and investigation, so we're bringing you a great lesson about this topic.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:24,600
Okay.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,640
So I'm really excited to hear this dialogue all about research.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,920
So why don't we start listening to two university professors discussing an important question.

11
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,979
We've been over this a thousand times.

12
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,939
The data is irrefutable.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,600
Look, we've done extensive research, built studies and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,560
Horowitz, I beg to differ.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,759
Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed.

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,180
You know as well as I do, the collection of data was not systematic, and there's a large margin of error.

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,280
To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading.

18
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,579
That is preposterous.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,400
You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you're oblivious to the fact that you're wrong.

20
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:19,000
I am not wrong.

21
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,700
The chicken came first.

22
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,599
No, the egg came first.

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,680
The chicken.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,400
Egg.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,040
The chicken.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,659
The egg.

27
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:26,560
The chicken.

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,540
The egg.

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,480
All right.

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,219
So interesting.

31
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,260
Which came first?

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,560
The chicken or the egg?

33
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,159
It's an age-old question, isn't it?

34
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,000
And apparently they are not going to agree anytime soon.

35
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:44,459
All right.

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,400
Well, what they can agree about is this awesome language.

37
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,359
So why don't we take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

38
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,299
Language Takeaway.

39
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,379
Okay, on Language Takeaway today, we have some really great words, and this first one is really good.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,700
Irrefutable.

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:02,939
Irrefutable.

42
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,340
Irrefutable.

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,140
The data is irrefutable.

44
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,819
Okay, so if the professor says that the data is irrefutable, what does he mean by that?

45
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,259
He's saying that you cannot deny it.

46
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:17,819
It is really, really true.

47
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:18,819
It is really true.

48
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,439
There is no way this is a lie.

49
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:20,919
Exactly.

50
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,379
Irrefutable evidence, for example.

51
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,840
Yeah, that's a great phrase.

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,120
All right, so the professor complained that Dr.

53
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,199
Harlowitz's experiment was flawed.

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:33,919
Flawed.

55
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:34,680
Flawed.

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,979
So, flawed.

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,979
Is that an adjective, a verb, or a noun?

58
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:42,120
It is an adjective here.

59
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:46,919
Now when something is flawed, there is a problem with it, right?

60
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,500
There's a mistake.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Okay, so it has an error.

62
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:48,819
Yep.

63
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,280
Okay, so this adjective is a way of saying that his experiment has a flaw.

64
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:55,060
A mistake.

65
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,620
Exactly.

66
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,319
So, flawed is the adjective of a flaw.

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:02:59,740
Right.

68
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:00,500
Okay.

69
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:07,659
Now the reason that his study or his experiment was flawed is because it was not systematic.

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,620
Systematic.

71
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,659
Systematic.

72
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,500
So, systematic.

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
That's an interesting word.

74
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,879
Now I think we can recognize the word system in here, right?

75
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,939
So, when something is systematic, it follows a process.

76
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,000
A certain order.

77
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,159
Yes, a certain system.

78
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,479
Right, so that's basically what systematic means, to follow a certain order, to be more organized, right?

79
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,099
Exactly.

80
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,419
Yep.

81
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,039
Okay.

82
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:33,599
And what about our next word?

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,939
Preposterous.

84
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,300
Preposterous.

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,319
Preposterous.

86
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,080
That is preposterous.

87
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,419
I love this phrase.

88
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,860
It usually goes together, right?

89
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,139
That is preposterous.

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,439
Yep.

91
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, so what does it mean when I say that?

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,400
It means it's absurd, it's ridiculous.

93
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
It doesn't make sense.

94
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,280
I can't believe you said that.

95
00:03:53,419 --> 00:04:00,719
Alright, well this is a really interesting phrase, but I think it's a little bit more common when it's used by older people.

96
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:07,759
Yeah, I don't think, I don't really see a young person going up to someone and say, hey, that's preposterous.

97
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,699
Yep, but it is a wonderful phrase.

98
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,180
Now, our final phrase for takeaway, oblivious.

99
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,340
Oblivious.

100
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,279
You're oblivious to the fact.

101
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,220
So a person that is oblivious to something.

102
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,399
They don't know or they're unaware.

103
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,720
Okay, so they ignore maybe the facts or they don't see it.

104
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,620
You're oblivious to the fact that we're in a recession.

105
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,439
Okay, or he is completely oblivious.

106
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,839
You can just say it like that, right?

107
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,699
Yep, he doesn't know.

108
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:44,259
Okay, so we took a look at some of the great vocabulary we found in the dialogue, but there were also some really good phrases that I think we should look at.

109
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:46,920
Okay, and let's take a look at those and putting it together.

110
00:04:51,980 --> 00:05:01,220
You know, Marco, one of the things I love about English is the way that words seem to fit together, like blocks coming together.

111
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,579
And here we have a lot of great examples of these words that fit together really nicely.

112
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,160
Okay, so why don't we look at those?

113
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,939
And our first one now is extensive research.

114
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,740
Extensive research.

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,879
Extensive research.

116
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,980
All right, so we know extensive means?

117
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,420
A lot.

118
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,060
A lot.

119
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:19,459
Yep.

120
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:21,720
So that's really good when you put it together.

121
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,779
Extensive research.

122
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:23,500
It means you have?

123
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,259
A lot of research.

124
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,100
You have really studied, you have really looked things up.

125
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,339
Okay, extensive research.

126
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:36,279
Another great research-related phrase here is conclusive evidence.

127
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Conclusive evidence.

128
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:39,939
Conclusive evidence.

129
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,620
All right, now the first word there, conclusive.

130
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,899
When something is conclusive, you can't argue with it.

131
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,600
It's the final decision.

132
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:56,379
All right, well, the professor complained that Horowitz's investigative approach was flawed, right?

133
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,199
Mm-hmm.

134
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,600
So this is our next phrase, investigative approach.

135
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,300
Investigative approach.

136
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,620
Investigative approach.

137
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay, so I remember the word investigate is a verb.

138
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,399
Yes.

139
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,639
But in this case, it's a?

140
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:09,660
It's an adjective.

141
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,680
It's an adjective.

142
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,680
When something is investigative, it's obviously having to do with?

143
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,839
An investigation.

144
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,740
Mm-hmm.

145
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:21,699
So the approach or the, so when he said investigative approach.

146
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,459
Just the, I mean, just simply the way you investigate.

147
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,639
Okay, the problem.

148
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,000
The way he investigated.

149
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,379
Okay, very interesting.

150
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,959
What about this other phrase that I saw?

151
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,920
It was really interesting.

152
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,620
Definitive conclusion.

153
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,980
Definitive conclusion.

154
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,100
So a definitive conclusion.

155
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,920
All right, well, again, I think we know the word conclusion, right?

156
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,319
Okay.

157
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,939
So it's a final judgment or decision.

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:48,579
All right.

159
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,519
When something is definitive, you can't argue with it or change it.

160
00:06:53,519 --> 00:07:01,800
Okay, so the conclusion or the final result is final.

161
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,839
Like, there is no way of arguing it.

162
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,220
Exactly.

163
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:05,079
Okay.

164
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:05,560
All right.

165
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,519
Definitive conclusion.

166
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,660
This is some great language, so why don't we listen to it one more time in the dialogue.

167
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:18,439
We've been over this a thousand times.

168
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,420
The data is irrefutable.

169
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:28,079
So, look, we've done extensive research, built studies and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory.

170
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,000
Horowitz, I beg to differ.

171
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,319
Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed.

172
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,680
You know as well as I do, the collection of data was not systematic, and there's a large margin of error.

173
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:44,759
To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading.

174
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,060
That is preposterous.

175
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,879
You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you're oblivious to the fact that you're wrong.

176
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,500
I am not wrong.

177
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,120
The chicken came first.

178
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,060
No, the egg came first.

179
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,139
The chicken.

180
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:00,860
Egg.

181
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,519
The chicken.

182
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,139
The egg.

183
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,060
The chicken.

184
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,079
The egg.

185
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:10,920
So, an interesting question.

186
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:11,540
What do you think?

187
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,759
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

188
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,699
Well, if you ask me, it was the egg.

189
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:17,379
It was the egg?

190
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:18,459
Interesting.

191
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,399
What about why did the chicken cross the road?

192
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,519
To get to the other side.

193
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,959
Do you think that's really the reason?

194
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,680
Well, there's a million different reasons, but this is great.

195
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,480
I'm glad you brought that up, because this is like the classic English joke.

196
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,899
The classic English joke, right?

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Why did the chicken cross the road?

198
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,759
And the answer is always?

199
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,519
Well, there are a million answers.

200
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,600
So, do you guys know any chicken jokes?

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:51,940
