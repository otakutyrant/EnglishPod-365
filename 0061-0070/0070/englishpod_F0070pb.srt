00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello everyone, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're bringing you a very, I would say, embarrassing lesson for us men.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Right, embarrassing for men, but I think it's okay for women.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right, we're going to be talking about buying underwear, specifically women's underwear.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Right, so obviously not the favorite thing for men to do.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, apart from being a little bit uncomfortable, it's also boring.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, it involves shopping, right?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It involves shopping, so we're not really big on that.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Alright, but well, even though it might be a little bit of an uncomfortable topic, there is some great language in here, isn't there?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, there's some really good words, and of course, the different types of underwear that we're going to be looking at.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But we also have some words that we're going to take a look at before we get into our dialogue.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So let's start with vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, we're going to look at two words that will appear in our dialogue, and the first one is lingerie.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lingerie.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lingerie.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, so lingerie, this is a nice, fancy word.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Basically for underwear, right?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Right, for women's underwear.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Women's underwear.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So lingerie, but it's very nice, very...

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Like pretty, sexy.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sexy underwear, yeah.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now the spelling of this word is interesting, isn't it?

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, it's spelled l-i-n-g-e-r-i-e.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Lingerie.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Lingerie.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, don't you love English spellings?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So women's nice, pretty, sexy underwear.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And our second word, awkward.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Awkward.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Awkward.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Awkward.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So this is a feeling that men have, especially when they're buying women's underwear.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, yeah, you feel a little bit uncomfortable, or it's a strange situation.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Or weird or out of place.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's awkward.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright, so we're going to be hearing both of these two words in the dialogue.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now, Marco, where are we here?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We're going to be at a department store at the section where they have women's lingerie, and we have a guy buying underwear for his girlfriend.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Alright, well, let's find out what happens.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This sucks.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I hate buying lingerie.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay, just find something and get out of here.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Alright, these are fine.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh no, don't come over here.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't come over here.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You look a little lost.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Can I help you?

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Um, I'm just having a look around.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm trying to find her something.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, you can't give her granny panties.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear?

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We've got these lovely silky nighties, or how about some nice panties in a bra set?

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra, and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sure, that's fine.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is so awkward.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What wellness do I pick?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What size is she?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, do you want a thong?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Some bikini briefs?

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Just pick something and get the hell out of here.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Um, I'll go with these two.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This is mortifying.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I just want to get this over with, and she better thank you for those things.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Here you are, sir.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sure she'll enjoy them.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Finally.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry, sir.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, the poor guy.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I totally feel bad for him.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, he was really nervous, and of course it was very uncomfortable for him.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I know, and then the security guard shows up.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Exactly.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But we had the opportunity to take a look at some really great words and phrases, so let's start off with our first one in language takeaway.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Language takeaway.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right, well we're going to look at words here that mostly have to do with underwear, describing underwear.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Right.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the first one is granny panties.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Granny panties.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Granny panties.

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This isn't like a real, real word, right?

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's not something you'll find in the dictionary.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, it's a slang word, and we use it to describe really big, ugly underwear like your grandmother would wear.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
All right, so they're not like the sexy little underwear.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's more like long, and it's not very appealing.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just picture what your grandmother would wear.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right, so granny panties.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So obviously this guy doesn't want to be buying any of those, but the saleswoman suggests that he try some sleepwear.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sleepwear.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sleepwear.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sleepwear.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, so sleepwear.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Obviously, clothes you wear when you're sleeping.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now this is really interesting because men aren't really that complicated when it comes to sleeping.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Just throw on a t-shirt and that's it.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, obviously for women there are more options and more different things you can choose from.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's a whole separate category for women.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I know.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Even when you're sleeping you must wear something nice.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
One type of sleepwear is silky nighties.

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Nighties.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Nighties.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
N-I-G-H-T-I-E-S.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, so a nightie.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's basically a dress that you wear when you sleep.

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, now the pronunciation is interesting because the first five letters are night.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Right, but you don't say night.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You don't say nightie.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You say nightie.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, you make the t a d.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Nightie.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Now she offered him some silky nighties.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right, so silky.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Obviously we know silk is a soft shiny fabric, right?

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So when something is silky it's either made from silk or it's soft and shiny.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, so some silky nighties.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Very soft shiny nighties.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Exactly.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay, what about our next word?

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, the sales girl offers different styles of undies.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Undies.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Undies.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Undies.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So undies is an interesting word.

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's basically short for underwear.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Underwear.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, so you can just call underwear undies.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, but I think you mostly use this when you're talking about women's underwear.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, really?

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I mean, I don't know if I would say undies when I'm talking about men's underwear.

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, I don't think so.

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Maybe children's underwear.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, for children.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For children, right?

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yep.

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
All right, so we saw some of the different types of clothing, but now let's take a look at this interesting adjective.

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mortifying.

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Mortifying.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is mortifying.

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mortifying.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay, so when something is mortifying.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, I think we've got some examples to show you what that is like.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Example one.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And then I fell in front of everyone.

158
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It was mortifying.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Example two.

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was completely mortified when I realized what I had done.

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Example three.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It must have been mortifying for her when she realized that her underwear was showing.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So basically, it's very embarrassing.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Super embarrassing.

165
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You want to die almost.

166
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yep.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, which is interesting.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I mean, mort, right?

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Interesting.

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All right.

173
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, some interesting.

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, so we saw the different types of underwear.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We saw this really great word for when you're really embarrassed.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So now let's take a look at some of the phrases that you would use when you're really embarrassed in Fluency Builder.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Fluency Builder.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right, well, we have two phrases to look at here.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The first one, get the hell out of here.

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Get the hell out of here.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Get the hell out of here.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Okay, so if I say I want to get the hell out of here.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You want to leave this place really quickly.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Really quickly.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I want to leave right now.

187
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Now when you're using this phrase or this sentence, get the hell out of here.

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is it really polite?

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, of course not.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's impolite.

191
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay, so it's really negative.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Very negative and informal, right?

193
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So you would use this maybe with your friends or like in this case, think it to yourself.

195
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, but it's not a good idea to use with your boss or your mother.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Right?

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yeah.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

199
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I guess sometimes depending on the tone you use, how you say it, you can sound really angry, right?

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Definitely.

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right.

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

203
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, let's listen to some examples.

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Example one.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This place is scary.

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Example two.

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What are you doing in my house?

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Get the hell out of here.

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Example three.

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We're at a friend's party and all of a sudden her parents arrived.

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We got the hell out of there as quickly as possible.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
All right.

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So get the hell out of here.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Get the hell out of here.

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder.

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Get this over with.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Get this over with.

220
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to get this over with.

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So you want to finish it really quickly.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But you want to finish it because you're not really enjoying it, right?

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Exactly.

224
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is something that you use when the situation is negative.

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's negative.

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

227
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So I just want to get this over with.

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, want to get this test over with.

230
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want to get this day over with.

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want to get this.

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe if you're on a bad date, I want to get this date over with.

233
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, exactly.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, interesting phrases.

236
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And I think it would help us to hear them once more in context in the dialogue.

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This sucks.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I hate buying lingerie.

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Just find something and get out of here.

241
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right.

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
These are fine.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, no.

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't come over here.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't come over here.

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You look a little lost.

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Can I help you?

248
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm just having a look around.

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow.

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm trying to find her something.

251
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, you can't give her granny panties.

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Have you thought about getting her some sleepwear?

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We've got these lovely silky nighties or how about some nice panties in a bra set?

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Look, here's a nice satin push-up bra and you can choose a few different styles of undies to go with it.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Sure, that's fine.

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is so awkward.

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What else do I pick?

258
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What size is she?

259
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, do you want a thong?

260
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Some bikini briefs?

261
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Maybe this nice pair of lacy boy shorts.

262
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Just pick something and get the hell out of here.

263
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll go with these two.

264
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is mortifying.

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I just want to get this over with and she better thank you for this.

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Here you are, sir.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm sure she'll enjoy them.

268
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Finally.

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry, sir.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to have to take a look inside your bag.

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
All right, so I guess the situation is very common.

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Men either having to shop for this type of article for their girlfriend or wife because it's their birthday or sometimes we get dragged into a store to buy this.

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So you're shopping with your girlfriend and she's going to make you go look at underwear with her.

274
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, I usually don't do that though.

275
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll just go to the next section and just look around.

276
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Look at tools.

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Look at TVs and PlayStations.

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, but you know what?

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have seen some men who go shopping with their girlfriends or wives and actually enjoy buying underwear.

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
See, that's the thing.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I think it makes sense, but I don't know how comfortable you would actually be.

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't know why.

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I guess just how it indicates sexuality and all this stuff.

284
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I could do it for maybe five or ten minutes, give my professional advice and then I'm out of there.

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
All right, well maybe those guys who look like they're enjoying themselves are just really talking in their heads, telling themselves how much they hate this.

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Exactly.

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Maybe they're just pretending or listening to their iPod.

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well, guys, I know we've got a lot of male listeners.

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Tell us what you think.

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you embarrassed by women's underwear?

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Right.

292
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Or women, why aren't you embarrassed when you buy men's underwear for your boyfriend or husband?

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think there's a lot to talk about here.

294
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So come to our website at EnglishPod.com.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Right.

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Leave your questions and comments and of course tell us what you think about this topic.

297
