00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:03,359
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,820
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,639
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:06,679
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:11,519
And today we're going to be bringing you the second part of our job interview series.

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,160
That's right.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,679
So this is an advanced lesson and we're going to be talking about educational background and experience.

8
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:18,420
Right.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,019
So in the first part we saw preparing for a job interview.

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:30,579
Now we are at the job interview and we're just going to be talking about your educational background and your job experience.

11
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,100
That's right.

12
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:35,159
And the language we're going to learn is going to focus mostly on these two areas.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,600
Okay, perfect.

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,820
So let's take a look at some of the difficult words before we listen to the dialogue in vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:45,820
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,359
Alright, so we're going to talk about a few common words that have to do with education.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,679
Now the first word, I think we might know this one, but there's a little trick to it.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,039
So the first one is major.

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Major.

20
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:01,420
Major.

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,760
So yeah, I guess everyone knows what a major is, right?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,019
Yeah, it's the main subject that you study in university.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:10,439
Right.

24
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,079
So you can study business as a major or history.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:14,840
Exactly.

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,239
Yeah.

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,219
So, but you can also use it as a verb, right?

28
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:18,760
That's right.

29
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,700
I majored in history.

30
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:21,760
Majored in.

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,519
So usually it's followed by the preposition in.

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,400
Yes, always.

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,959
In fact, when used as a verb, I majored in science.

34
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,159
I majored in business.

35
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:32,640
Yes.

36
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,959
Okay, so you can say my major is business administration or history, or you can say I majored in business.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,439
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,640
And the same pattern applies to minor.

39
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,019
Okay, so minor.

40
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:50,200
This is really interesting because this is more common in English speaking countries, right?

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,659
That's right.

42
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,799
So what exactly is a minor?

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,579
Well, just like your major, but smaller.

44
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,579
Okay.

45
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:06,319
So if you major in history, maybe 60% of your classes are in history and you minor in French, maybe 30 or 40% of your classes are in French.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,680
So basically you can have two subjects in your degree.

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,659
You can have a major in business with a minor in art.

48
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:12,159
Yes.

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,460
Okay, that's interesting.

50
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,919
All right.

51
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,740
And another two simple words, a bachelor's degree.

52
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,199
Bachelor's degree.

53
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:20,520
Okay.

54
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,360
A bachelor's degree is what you get after going to university for four years.

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:25,840
Okay.

56
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,780
So a bachelor's degree after four years, you get that.

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,139
After that, you get a master's degree.

58
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:31,580
Right.

59
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:35,300
So that's another two years after your bachelor's degree.

60
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:35,860
Okay.

61
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,419
And I guess a master's is more focused on an area, right?

62
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:40,740
Yes.

63
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:41,639
More specialized.

64
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:42,539
More specialized.

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,860
And then the highest degree you can get is a PhD.

66
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,460
Exactly.

67
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,259
Which is a philosophy doctorate, right?

68
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,180
But you're not actually getting a degree in philosophy.

69
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,000
No, it could be in international relations.

70
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:57,680
Okay.

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,520
But this is really hard to get.

72
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,219
You have to go to school for another five or six years, right?

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,819
And it's a lot of research and not many people have it.

74
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,180
Yeah.

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,020
Anyway, some simple words.

76
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:08,939
But you know what?

77
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,139
It's quite unique to the English speaking world so we thought we'd bring it to you now.

78
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:14,620
Right.

79
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,080
Perfect.

80
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:22,340
So now let's listen to this guy who is at an interview and he's going to be talking about his education and work experience.

81
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,500
Thanks for coming in today.

82
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,280
Did you have any trouble finding us?

83
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:39,639
Please take a seat.

84
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:40,539
Thank you.

85
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Let's get started.

86
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,159
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

87
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:46,300
Sure.

88
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:55,620
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in business administration with a specialization in information management and I minored in psychology.

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,919
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,460
I wanted to gain some practical marketable skills, which the information management track provided.

91
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,360
And I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in psychology.

92
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,539
Interesting.

93
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,620
And your postgraduate studies?

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior so I pursued a master's in that area.

95
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,660
I also strive to keep my professional skills current so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

96
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,259
Very good.

97
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,019
Now tell me a little bit about your work experience.

98
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,819
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

99
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,819
Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care and process management.

100
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,779
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,560
Interesting.

102
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:52,920
Yes.

103
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,779
In this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company.

104
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:05,279
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about 5%, which had a direct impact on revenue.

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,620
Well, those were some pretty good answers to those questions, but I don't know, Marco.

106
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,259
There was a little awkward moment.

107
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,699
I don't know if you guys heard it.

108
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,439
Natural body functions.

109
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,480
Well, making the interview a little bit more interesting, right?

110
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,480
It doesn't have to be boring.

111
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,060
Exactly.

112
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,579
But what is really interesting is some of the language he used to describe his educational background and work experience.

113
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,959
So let's look at that now in Language Takeaway.

114
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:45,180
Language Takeaway.

115
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,300
Okay, so in Language Takeaway today, we have seven words that we want to focus on before we give you some tips about doing well on a job interview.

116
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,439
So let's take a look at the first word.

117
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:57,139
Course of study.

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,459
Course of study.

119
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,199
Course of study.

120
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,420
A course of study.

121
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,980
So what is a course of study exactly?

122
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:09,420
Basically, it's like a plan of study or a path of study.

123
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,920
Okay, so his course of study was business administration.

124
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,699
Exactly.

125
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,120
So that is his course of study.

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,819
Now let's take a look at our second word.

127
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:21,660
Track.

128
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Track.

129
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Track.

130
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Track.

131
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:32,139
So he said he wanted to gain some practical, markable skills that the information management track provided.

132
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:32,779
Exactly.

133
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,660
So what does he mean by this track?

134
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,759
Again, basically the track of study is like the path of study.

135
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,399
Okay.

136
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,819
So the direction of your study.

137
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:48,319
Okay, so I guess it would be like think of a train and the train tracks, right?

138
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:48,759
Exactly.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,759
Where the train travels.

140
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,639
So that's where it's taking you.

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,000
That's the path that he followed or you should follow or you want to follow.

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,420
Yes.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,639
Okay, that's pretty interesting.

144
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,319
Now let's take a look at our third word, and it's a really nice conjunction.

145
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:03,439
Hence.

146
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:04,199
Hence.

147
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:05,480
Hence.

148
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,879
H-e-n-c-e.

149
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:07,199
Hence.

150
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:07,959
Hence.

151
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,019
So it sounds fancy, but yes, what does it mean?

152
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,579
So.

153
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:12,339
Therefore.

154
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:12,899
Yeah.

155
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,259
Right.

156
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,720
So you can use it as a conjunction between two ideas.

157
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,199
So he said, what would be an example of how you could use hence?

158
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,379
You could say the economy is doing poorly, hence people are losing their jobs.

159
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:26,019
Okay.

160
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:26,699
Hence.

161
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,879
So therefore in consequence.

162
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:29,500
Right.

163
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,339
Exactly.

164
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:33,399
But it just sounds a lot more like professional.

165
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,160
Formal.

166
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:34,639
Formal.

167
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:34,899
Yeah.

168
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,540
Okay.

169
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,720
So try and use this conjunction.

170
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,120
Hence.

171
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:38,519
Right.

172
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,879
Instead of saying, so therefore.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,220
Yep.

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,100
Use it.

175
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,680
Okay.

176
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:42,620
Our fourth word.

177
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,540
Pursued.

178
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,699
Pursued.

179
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,699
He pursued a master's.

180
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:48,060
Okay.

181
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,800
So to pursue.

182
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,720
To chase after something.

183
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:52,579
To chase after.

184
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,839
So you can pursue a master's degree like he did.

185
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,240
Yes.

186
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,779
You can pursue a promotion.

187
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:58,740
A dream.

188
00:07:59,560 --> 00:07:59,959
Nice one.

189
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
Can you pursue a girl?

190
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,259
Yes, you can.

191
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:02,779
All right.

192
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,519
So pursue to chase.

193
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:05,019
Yes.

194
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:05,819
Okay.

195
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,699
Now let's look at our next word.

196
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,420
Strive.

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,220
Another great word you can use in talking about your experience.

198
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,300
To strive is to try really hard.

199
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,420
To try really hard.

200
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:15,639
Yeah.

201
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:16,180
Okay.

202
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,800
So I know we have some examples for strive.

203
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:19,220
Yeah.

204
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,240
Let's take a listen.

205
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,560
Example one.

206
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,959
At our company, we are always striving to improve our services.

207
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,259
Example two.

208
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,080
He really strived to get a new job and his work paid off.

209
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,220
Okay.

210
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,580
Great examples of strive.

211
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,580
To fight.

212
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,960
To try really hard.

213
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,259
Yep.

214
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:46,240
All right.

215
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,240
Okay.

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,799
Now the next word, I didn't really know what it meant.

217
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,559
So this is really interesting.

218
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,220
Breadth.

219
00:08:58,419 --> 00:08:58,940
Breadth.

220
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,379
Breadth of experience.

221
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:01,159
Okay.

222
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,639
So this basically means it's wide.

223
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:04,399
Exactly.

224
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:11,220
So when you have a great breadth of experience, you have a wide variety of experience.

225
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:11,840
Okay.

226
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,179
So maybe in different fields or in different jobs.

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,659
So you can have experience like in marketing and in a little bit in finance and a little bit in management.

228
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,139
Yes.

229
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,620
A breadth of experience.

230
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:22,299
All right.

231
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:22,860
All right.

232
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,360
And now for the last word, it's actually three in one.

233
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,639
A three in one deal.

234
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,460
Three in one deal.

235
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,980
That actually they are very related.

236
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:29,419
Okay.

237
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:29,799
Right.

238
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:38,759
So when he talked about his work experience, he was saying he supervised and coordinated the customer support team.

239
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,279
Okay.

240
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,039
So he watched over, right?

241
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,580
And made things work together well.

242
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,299
To coordinate.

243
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:45,679
Yes.

244
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:50,159
So these are really great verbs that you can use when you're talking about your job responsibilities.

245
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:50,519
Yes.

246
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,519
I supervised.

247
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,860
I coordinated.

248
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,500
And here's another really great one that said to implement.

249
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,659
To implement.

250
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
To make something happen.

251
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,000
To put it in place.

252
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:02,399
Right.

253
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,759
So he implemented new strategies.

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,139
Implemented new policies.

255
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:06,799
Okay.

256
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,419
To set in action.

257
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,159
Exactly.

258
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,259
All right.

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,440
So a lot of great vocabulary.

260
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,799
A lot of great stuff.

261
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,460
And well, you can use it for when you are at a job interview.

262
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,379
So let's listen to this dialogue again.

263
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,580
And when we come back, we're going to give you some tips.

264
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,940
So you'll do well in this part of the job interview.

265
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,700
Thanks for coming in today.

266
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,460
Did you have any trouble finding us?

267
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,840
Please take a seat.

268
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,159
Thank you.

269
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
Let's get started.

270
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,399
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

271
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,440
Sure.

272
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,220
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in business administration.

273
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,039
With a specialization in information management.

274
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,779
And I minored in psychology.

275
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,100
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

276
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:04,639
I wanted to gain some practical marketable skills, which the information management track provided.

277
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,019
And I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success.

278
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,559
Hence the minor in psychology.

279
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,740
Interesting.

280
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:13,820
And your postgraduate studies?

281
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,179
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior.

282
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,320
So I pursued a master's in that area.

283
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,980
I also strive to keep my professional skills current.

284
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,860
So I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

285
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,480
Very good.

286
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,179
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

287
00:11:35,539 --> 00:11:38,019
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

288
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:45,019
Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care and process management.

289
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:51,980
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.

290
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:53,799
Interesting.

291
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,120
Yes.

292
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,960
In this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company.

293
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:07,360
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about 5%, which had a direct impact on revenue.

294
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,320
All right.

295
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,240
Well, I want to talk about two main things.

296
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,159
And the first thing I want to talk about is how you address this question about your educational background.

297
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,960
Like what is the interviewer looking to find out?

298
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,240
Okay, perfect.

299
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:33,980
So when you are talking about your educational background, you shouldn't only talk about your college degree, right?

300
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:34,220
Yeah.

301
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,220
You should also talk about any type of training that you've had.

302
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:46,700
Yeah, I think it's really important to let the interviewer know that you're continually trying to update your skills and improve your knowledge.

303
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,659
So any sort of courses or seminars that you might attend, this is a great chance to highlight those.

304
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,659
And that's what the interview is looking for, right?

305
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:03,679
Also, any trade publications, any magazines that you read related to your job is a great way to sort of highlight your desire to keep learning.

306
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:24,179
Well, I think that's really important because it's good that you went to a good university, you got this degree and everything, but continuously training yourself and maybe just by listening to business podcasts or reading specific magazines or stuff like that, that is demonstrating that you care about what you do and that you are continuously learning, right?

307
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,639
Exactly.

308
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:29,559
Okay, so those are the main things to talk about in your educational background.

309
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,639
Now, when this work experience question pops up, what should you really say?

310
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,279
When you're answering this question, I think there's something really important to keep in mind.

311
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:40,340
What's that?

312
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:44,259
You want to make sure that you're being as specific as possible, right?

313
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:44,840
Right.

314
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:54,299
So giving examples of what you've done, like really specifically what you did, all of the sort of the main achievements you have.

315
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:05,539
Okay, so like, for example, we saw in our dialogue that he talked about specific strategies that he implemented to improve customer support in that company, right?

316
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,279
And he then he gave some numbers, right?

317
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,919
He said he lowered the churn rate to about 5%.

318
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:22,899
So it's so important whenever you can attach a number to your success or your achievement to be able to do that in the interview really, really demonstrates your achievement.

319
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,659
Yeah, I think that's really important.

320
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,940
And another thing when you're talking about previous jobs is make sure you keep it on a positive note.

321
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,440
Yeah, yeah.

322
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:41,779
Even if your experience was not very good, or you didn't like the company, or, you know, you had problems, you should avoid talking about that and always keep it on a positive note.

323
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,200
Right.

324
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:51,860
So if the interviewer asks you why you why you want to join this company, why you're looking to leave your, your current job, you, you want to give these positive reasons, right?

325
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,019
You don't want to say well, because my boss was a jerk, or, or I didn't like the company anymore.

326
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:06,779
You know, you should answer it with something positive like, well, I think I need a change or this job opportunity is more aligned with what I want to do in the future, etc.

327
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,980
Yeah, so positive always on your interviews.

328
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,460
And just, again, prepare for these questions that are always going to be there.

329
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:13,879
Yes.

330
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,240
So Erica, I know that you've done a lot of interviews.

331
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,620
And I understand that you've had a really weird question.

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,120
Yes, in an interview, I once got this question.

333
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,419
If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?

334
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:29,259
Really?

335
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,159
Yeah, I'm not kidding.

336
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,379
I really was asked that question.

337
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,279
What did you answer?

338
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,080
Um, I think I said that I would want to be a willow tree because they're really beautiful.

339
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,139
Was that the right answer?

340
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,100
I don't know.

341
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,100
Like, what are you supposed to answer to that question?

342
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,919
I really don't know what the right answer was.

343
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,080
Well, some people Yeah, they'll ask you just, I don't know, random questions.

344
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,460
Yeah, see what your responses.

345
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:56,679
I think also, maybe it's just how you deal with with, with the pressure or with the unexpected question, right?

346
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,919
So it's like, that is pretty unexpected.

347
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,820
But I guess you handle it pretty well.

348
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,480
Okay, well, I mean, I got the job.

349
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,899
So all right.

350
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:04,559
All right.

351
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,240
I want to know from our listeners, if they were a tree, what kind of tree they would be?

352
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:09,919
Yeah.

353
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,659
And also tell us about, well, your job experience or your educational background?

354
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,620
Well, I know, for example, that I've had a lot of different types of jobs.
