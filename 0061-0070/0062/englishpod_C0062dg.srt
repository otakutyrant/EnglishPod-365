EnglishPod.com Thanks for coming in today.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Did you have any trouble finding us?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please, take a seat.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, let's get started.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sure.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in Psychology.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the Information Management track provided, and I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in Psychology.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Interesting.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And your postgraduate studies?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a Master's in that area.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Very good.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, I worked as their Customer Support Manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care and process management.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team, as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Interesting.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, in this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about 5%, which had a direct impact on revenue.
