EnglishPod.com Thanks for coming in today.

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,019
Did you have any trouble finding us?

3
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:14,400
Please, take a seat.

4
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:15,480
Thank you.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,260
Well, let's get started.

6
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,879
Tell me a bit about your educational background.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,059
Sure.

8
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:30,339
Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in Psychology.

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,640
I chose this course of study for two reasons.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:43,140
I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the Information Management track provided, and I also feel that the interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in Psychology.

11
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,280
Interesting.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,359
And your postgraduate studies?

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a Master's in that area.

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:59,380
I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related to management and customer service.

15
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,000
Very good.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,760
Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience.

17
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,579
I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.

18
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,560
Yeah, I worked as their Customer Support Manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care and process management.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,519
I supervised and coordinated the customer support team, as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,340
Interesting.

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,500
Yes, in this position, I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company.

22
00:01:33,099 --> 00:01:39,900
With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about 5%, which had a direct impact on revenue.
