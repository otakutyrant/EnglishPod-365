00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,919
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:05,980
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,400
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,939
And today, we're bringing you a lesson that was requested by one of our listeners.

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,839
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,739
We got a request for a dialogue about a receptionist.

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,519
So a receptionist at an office or at a hotel.

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,800
So today's dialogue is simple, but we're gonna be looking at some really great phrases.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,200
Yeah, phrases that will help you sound really, really professional and really fluent.

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,820
So we are at an office today and the receptionist is greeting somebody that has an appointment.

12
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,780
All right, see what happens.

13
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,859
Good afternoon.

14
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,179
May I help you?

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,320
Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

16
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,459
I have an appointment at four.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,620
Certainly.

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,239
May I take your name?

19
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,939
I'll let her know you've arrived.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:09,540
Sure.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,159
It's Haralee.

22
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,819
Can I offer you something to drink?

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,980
Yes, coffee would be nice.

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:20,900
Thank you.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,219
Here you are.

26
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,340
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

27
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,459
I'll show you to her office right this way.

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,650
Just watch your step here.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,230
Well, that's pretty embarrassing.

30
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,209
Hey, that was embarrassing.

31
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,450
That's what happens to women when they wear high heels.

32
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,069
See, actually, that happened to me last weekend.

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,709
Really?

34
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:05,109
I fell down the stairs and my knees are quite blue.

35
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:08,909
Oh, no, see, high heels are dangerous.

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,469
I don't know why women wear them.

37
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,289
Well, I don't know, but that's not what we're here to discover.

38
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,909
Right.

39
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:21,389
Okay, so let's take a look at some of these great phrases in Fluency Builder.

40
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,750
Fluency Builder.

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:33,409
Well, I really liked how this receptionist used some excellent phrases to sound really professional.

42
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:37,169
And one thing she said was, certainly.

43
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:39,009
Certainly.

44
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:39,729
Certainly.

45
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,090
So why did she say certainly?

46
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:50,830
Well, this is a nice way to respond, to make the other person know that you understand what they said.

47
00:02:51,169 --> 00:02:55,629
So Josh O'Neill said, yes, I'm here to see you, Joanna Stevens.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,629
I have an appointment at four.

49
00:02:58,409 --> 00:02:58,409
Certainly.

50
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,150
So she is saying, I understand what you said.

51
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:01,789
Yes.

52
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,330
And then she said, may I take your name?

53
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,689
May I take your name?

54
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,770
May I take your name?

55
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,669
So this is a nice way of saying, what is your name?

56
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:12,389
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:17,729
So now this is really important because if you said, what is your name?

58
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:18,490
Is that correct?

59
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,750
It's correct, but it's not really very.

60
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,789
Exactly.

61
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,750
Or I would say plight to a certain extent.

62
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,150
Yes.

63
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:26,789
Okay.

64
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:28,210
So may I take your name?

65
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:29,590
May I take your name?

66
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,969
You use this phrase when you are going to write down the person's name.

67
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:35,590
Right.

68
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,689
So if you meet somebody on the street or at a bar, you wouldn't say, may I take your name?

69
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,050
No.

70
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:42,610
Right.

71
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,930
Unless you're going to write it down.

72
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,030
So usually for an office setting where the receptionist has to write down the name.

73
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:50,389
Yes.

74
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,110
All right.

75
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,270
One more phrase.

76
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:53,229
Ms.

77
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,590
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

78
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:56,550
Okay.

79
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:57,189
Ms.

80
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,509
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

81
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,909
Will be with you momentarily.

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,849
Okay.

83
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,889
So this is really polite.

84
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:06,330
Yes.

85
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,669
Momentarily.

86
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:08,490
What does that mean?

87
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,650
In a moment.

88
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:10,189
Soon.

89
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,050
Again, she could have said, Ms.

90
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,310
Stevens will come out soon or Ms.

91
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,430
Stevens will see you in a minute.

92
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:19,949
Yes.

93
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,209
But that's, again, it's not really that polite, right?

94
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:23,449
Yeah.

95
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,310
So when you want to be formal, you can say, Ms.

96
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:29,610
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

97
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,750
Okay.

98
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:32,149
That's a really nice phrase.

99
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:33,009
All right.

100
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,810
There's so much in this dialogue.

101
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,089
So many great, wonderful, polite phrases.

102
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,529
So why don't we listen to it one more time, but this time, slow down.

103
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,810
Good afternoon.

104
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:52,769
May I help you?

105
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:53,790
Yes.

106
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,870
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

107
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,129
I have an appointment at four.

108
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:01,889
Certainly.

109
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,449
May I take your name?

110
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,709
I'll let her know you've arrived.

111
00:05:08,589 --> 00:05:08,790
Sure.

112
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,990
It's Josh O'Neill.

113
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,050
Ms.

114
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:15,410
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

115
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,610
Can I offer you something to drink?

116
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,970
Yes.

117
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,569
Coffee would be nice.

118
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,470
Thank you.

119
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,310
Here you are.

120
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,250
Ms.

121
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,110
Stevens is ready for you now.

122
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,470
I'll show you to her office.

123
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,129
Right this way.

124
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,970
Just watch your step here.

125
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:40,589
Okay.

126
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:46,449
So it's pretty clear now, but there are still a couple of phrases that I would like to look at.

127
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,189
So why don't we look at the last two sentences?

128
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:50,730
Okay.

129
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,350
Ms.

130
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:53,250
Stevens is ready for you now.

131
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:53,870
Ms.

132
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:55,709
Stevens is ready for you now.

133
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,889
Ms.

134
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,589
Stevens is ready for you.

135
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,329
So when she says ready for you, what does that mean?

136
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,970
Prepared to speak to you.

137
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:05,410
Okay.

138
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,629
So instead of saying, Ms.

139
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,689
Stevens is ready or Ms.

140
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,110
Stevens can see you now.

141
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,509
Yes.

142
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,689
You use this great little phrase is ready for you.

143
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,550
Okay.

144
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,730
And then she said, I'll show you to her office.

145
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,649
I'll show you to her office.

146
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,670
I'll show you to her office.

147
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,329
This is a lovely way of saying, I will take you to the office.

148
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:28,449
I will take you to the office.

149
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,709
And she followed it by saying, right this way.

150
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,029
Right this way.

151
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:35,209
Right this way.

152
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,110
So again, walk this way.

153
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:38,889
Walk this way.

154
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,629
This way, please.

155
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,009
Yes.

156
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,209
Right this way.

157
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,730
It sounds really, really nice.

158
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,569
Really polite.

159
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:45,449
Really welcoming.

160
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:46,110
Right.

161
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:48,269
And especially if you use it together, right?

162
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,110
I'll show you to her office right this way, please.

163
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:51,689
Yes.

164
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,730
Okay.

165
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:57,509
So it's a really great way of being polite to somebody at an office.

166
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,670
Now the final useful phrase, watch your step.

167
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,029
Watch your step.

168
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,970
Watch your step.

169
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:08,569
So watch your step.

170
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:10,529
You see that everywhere in the signs.

171
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:11,649
Be careful.

172
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,089
Be careful where you step.

173
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,470
Yes.

174
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,970
Be careful where you're walking.

175
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,870
Okay.

176
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,009
So obviously she didn't watch her step and she fell.

177
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:20,670
She fell.

178
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,750
Okay.

179
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,389
So really great phrases.

180
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:25,870
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

181
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:35,670
Good afternoon.

182
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:37,009
May I help you?

183
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,050
Yes.

184
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,110
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

185
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,290
I have an appointment at four.

186
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,430
Certainly.

187
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,069
May I take your name?

188
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,750
I'll let her know you've arrived.

189
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:46,350
Sure.

190
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,689
It's Josh O'Neill.

191
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,170
Ms.

192
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:52,689
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

193
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,610
Can I offer you something to drink?

194
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:55,430
Yes.

195
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:56,790
Coffee would be nice.

196
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,210
Thank you.

197
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,970
Here you are.

198
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:07,769
Ms.

199
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,170
Stevens is ready for you now.

200
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,189
I'll show you to her office right this way.

201
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,050
Just watch your step here.

202
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,769
All right.

203
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:29,829
So a really simple dialogue, but with a lot of good phrases in there.

204
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,870
And it's also a good review for more advanced students, right?

205
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:34,330
Yeah.

206
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:41,429
Remember, like these phrases can really help you sound more professional, more welcoming, more polite, basically.

207
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,149
Okay.
