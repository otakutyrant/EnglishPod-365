00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today, we're bringing you a lesson that was requested by one of our listeners.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We got a request for a dialogue about a receptionist.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So a receptionist at an office or at a hotel.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So today's dialogue is simple, but we're gonna be looking at some really great phrases.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, phrases that will help you sound really, really professional and really fluent.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So we are at an office today and the receptionist is greeting somebody that has an appointment.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
All right, see what happens.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Good afternoon.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
May I help you?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have an appointment at four.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Certainly.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
May I take your name?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll let her know you've arrived.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sure.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's Haralee.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Can I offer you something to drink?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, coffee would be nice.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here you are.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Miss Stevens is ready for you now.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll show you to her office right this way.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just watch your step here.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, that's pretty embarrassing.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hey, that was embarrassing.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's what happens to women when they wear high heels.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
See, actually, that happened to me last weekend.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Really?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I fell down the stairs and my knees are quite blue.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, no, see, high heels are dangerous.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know why women wear them.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, I don't know, but that's not what we're here to discover.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Right.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, so let's take a look at some of these great phrases in Fluency Builder.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Fluency Builder.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, I really liked how this receptionist used some excellent phrases to sound really professional.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And one thing she said was, certainly.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Certainly.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Certainly.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So why did she say certainly?

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, this is a nice way to respond, to make the other person know that you understand what they said.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So Josh O'Neill said, yes, I'm here to see you, Joanna Stevens.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have an appointment at four.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Certainly.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So she is saying, I understand what you said.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And then she said, may I take your name?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
May I take your name?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
May I take your name?

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So this is a nice way of saying, what is your name?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So now this is really important because if you said, what is your name?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is that correct?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's correct, but it's not really very.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Exactly.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Or I would say plight to a certain extent.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So may I take your name?

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
May I take your name?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You use this phrase when you are going to write down the person's name.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Right.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So if you meet somebody on the street or at a bar, you wouldn't say, may I take your name?

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Unless you're going to write it down.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So usually for an office setting where the receptionist has to write down the name.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
All right.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
One more phrase.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Ms.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Ms.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Will be with you momentarily.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So this is really polite.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Momentarily.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What does that mean?

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
In a moment.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Soon.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Again, she could have said, Ms.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Stevens will come out soon or Ms.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Stevens will see you in a minute.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But that's, again, it's not really that polite, right?

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So when you want to be formal, you can say, Ms.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's a really nice phrase.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
All right.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There's so much in this dialogue.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So many great, wonderful, polite phrases.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So why don't we listen to it one more time, but this time, slow down.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Good afternoon.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
May I help you?

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have an appointment at four.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Certainly.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
May I take your name?

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll let her know you've arrived.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sure.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's Josh O'Neill.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Ms.

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can I offer you something to drink?

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yes.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Coffee would be nice.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Here you are.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ms.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stevens is ready for you now.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll show you to her office.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right this way.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Just watch your step here.

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So it's pretty clear now, but there are still a couple of phrases that I would like to look at.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So why don't we look at the last two sentences?

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Ms.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Stevens is ready for you now.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ms.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Stevens is ready for you now.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ms.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Stevens is ready for you.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So when she says ready for you, what does that mean?

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Prepared to speak to you.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So instead of saying, Ms.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Stevens is ready or Ms.

140
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Stevens can see you now.

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You use this great little phrase is ready for you.

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And then she said, I'll show you to her office.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll show you to her office.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll show you to her office.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is a lovely way of saying, I will take you to the office.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will take you to the office.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And she followed it by saying, right this way.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Right this way.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right this way.

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So again, walk this way.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Walk this way.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This way, please.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes.

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Right this way.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It sounds really, really nice.

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really polite.

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Really welcoming.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And especially if you use it together, right?

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll show you to her office right this way, please.

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So it's a really great way of being polite to somebody at an office.

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now the final useful phrase, watch your step.

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Watch your step.

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Watch your step.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So watch your step.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You see that everywhere in the signs.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Be careful.

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Be careful where you step.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Be careful where you're walking.

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So obviously she didn't watch her step and she fell.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She fell.

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So really great phrases.

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Good afternoon.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
May I help you?

183
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm here to see Joanna Stevens.

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I have an appointment at four.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Certainly.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
May I take your name?

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll let her know you've arrived.

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Sure.

190
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's Josh O'Neill.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Ms.

192
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Stevens will be with you momentarily.

193
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Can I offer you something to drink?

194
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

195
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Coffee would be nice.

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you.

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Here you are.

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ms.

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Stevens is ready for you now.

200
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll show you to her office right this way.

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just watch your step here.

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
All right.

203
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So a really simple dialogue, but with a lot of good phrases in there.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And it's also a good review for more advanced students, right?

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah.

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Remember, like these phrases can really help you sound more professional, more welcoming, more polite, basically.

207
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.
