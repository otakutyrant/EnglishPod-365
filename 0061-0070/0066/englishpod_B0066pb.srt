00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we're going to be bringing you a great lesson about calling the office.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah, that's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So in this lesson, we're going to teach you some great words that you can use when you need to call your office to solve a problem.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So you are at home, you have a problem, maybe you can't go to the office.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So you have to call them and tell them that you're not going to be able to go.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Alright, so we're not going to preview anything today because the dialogue is relatively easy.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's listen to the dialogue for the first time and then we'll come back and look at some words.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Actually, I'm a pretty easy dialogue.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, pretty simple.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Alright, so there are a couple of words that we want to look at.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So let's start with language takeaway.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Language takeaway.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Alright, well today we're looking at three interesting words.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The first one is ooflay.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ooflay.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ooflay.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Ooflay.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Marco, what is the ooflay?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Alright, so when you have the ooflay, it means that you are sick.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You have, it's very similar to a cold.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right, but just worse, right?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Worse, yeah.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So when you have the ooflay, it'll keep you in bed for a while, for maybe a week or two.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So you have a fever, your body is hurting.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're really sick.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, you're really sick.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, ooflay.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Alright, well what about our next word?

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, actually the next word is a phrase that you can use when you're calling the office.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Alinkai in iksei.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Alinkai in iksei.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Alinkai in iksei.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Okay, this is a really useful phrase and I think it would help us to hear some examples of what it sounds like so we can understand the meaning.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Example one.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oofay iplpay aldke in iksei udetei.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Example two.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If ooyei aldke in iksei on one ormei aintei oryei airdfei.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Example three.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Imatnei ilingfei aloue.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ossei imalenkei in iksei.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So with this phrase, you're basically saying that you are not going to the office.

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Exactly.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So let's take a look at our last word for language takeaway.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Ikovarei.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ikovarei.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Okay, so it's a pretty simple word.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ikovarei means to get better, to start feeling healthy again.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay, so kind of to recharge your batteries.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Exactly, so this is a great verb to use when you want to say I'm going to feel better.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, ikovarei.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So some really great words, some really interesting phrases.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So let's listen to this dialogue again and then we'll come back.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
All right, Marco, have you ever found yourself in a situation like this?

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, yeah, a couple of times that I haven't been able to really make it to the office and I've had to call.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So yeah, I would have to call and tell them that I'm not going to make it or maybe then I'm going to be a little bit late.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right, well, yeah, happens to all of us.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And now you guys have all of this useful language next time you face this problem.
