00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about sports, part of our sports series.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right, and in this lesson we are talking about maybe the world's most favorite sports.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Right, one of the most popular sports in the world, soccer.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Or also known as football in other countries.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, so before we get started with this great lesson, let's take a look at some of the words we'll find in the dialogue in Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to look at three words here.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The first word is wingman.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wingman.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A wingman.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now wingman isn't really related to soccer in any way.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But it's a way of referring to somebody as your right hand.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So your helper.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Your helper, your number one guy.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Okay.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Right.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So a wingman is someone who helps you a lot.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Uh huh, exactly.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay, our next word, tied.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Tied.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
They are tied.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They are tied.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now this is an interesting word because tie can be a noun, verb, and an adjective, right?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Exactly.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So in this case, they are tied.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's an adjective meaning they have the same score.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And a tie is a game that has ended with no winner or loser.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Both of them had the same score.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Exactly.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And so obviously the verb to tie is to reach the same score as your other team.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Exactly.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright, well our third word can also be used as a noun and a verb and it is foul.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Fouled.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fouled.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay, so to foul somebody is to do something to them that is not allowed in the sport.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And so when you do this, you have committed a foul.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Okay, so you use it in the same way.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
To foul or a foul.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Interesting.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, we're going to hear these three words in context now.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So why don't we listen to our soccer dialogue?

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Welcome back soccer fans.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My name is Rick Fields and as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman Bob Copeland.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And we're in the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of bounds.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That'll be a throw in for Brazil.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robinho and the ref has called him offside.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No question about it, he was offside by a mile.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He shoots deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Del Gallo takes the corner.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We have a foul.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh no, Dita the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this and become world champions.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He gets ready for the kick.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He shoots and he...

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay, so Ecuador tied with Brazil in the 2022 World Cup.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Wow Marco, I'm really happy to see that you are able to see so far into the future.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, I called it so in 2022 if we do win the World Cup you know who said it first.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right, do you have money on that?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Uh, yes.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
All right, so apart from this we saw some really great vocabulary in this lesson so let's take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Language Takeaway.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All right, we've got a lot of soccer words for you but they're all important.

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So let's take a look at the first one.

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Kickoff.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Kickoff.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Kickoff.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So a kickoff.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is how you start a soccer game, right?

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right, so it's the very beginning the referee blows the whistle and you kick the ball to another player.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's the kickoff.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, so our next phrase out of bounds.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Out of bounds.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Out of bounds.

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, out of bounds.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is a great word.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So in soccer when the ball goes out of bounds it goes outside the white lines, right?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Outside of the playing field.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay, and you can use it in all other sports.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can use it in basketball.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can use it in tennis or football or anything.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right, so any part that is not for playing.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Out of bounds.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's our next word?

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Throw in.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A throw in.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A throw in.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay, so a throw in.

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The ball goes out of bounds.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How do you put it back into play?

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Obviously, a throw in.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay, so you throw in the ball.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's the only time where a soccer player will actually grab the ball with his hands.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right, now another soccer term we have here.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Offside.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Offside.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Offside.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay, so this is a soccer field, and you are trying to score a goal.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now you have some defenders, right?

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Those are the people who are trying to take the ball away, and you pass the ball to somebody who is behind the defenders.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, and that person is offside.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Exactly, so you must be at all times in the same position as the defenders or in front of them, but you can't be all the way in the back.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay, so is this a noun or a verb or an adjective?

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So this is an adjective.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He is offside.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's his condition.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, great.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Excellent explanation, Marco.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Thank you.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
All right, now we're going to look at three different phrases for three types of kicks in soccer.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, so let's take a look at this.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The first one is goal kick.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
A goal kick.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay, goal kick.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So who does the goal kick?

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a keeper who takes the goal kick.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Okay, so when the goalie kicks the ball.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now, what about a corner kick?

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, so if the team is attacking and the ball goes out of bounds in the back area near the goal, then they get a corner kick.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They gotta kick the ball from the corner of the field.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is a great chance to score a goal, isn't it?

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Exactly, yes.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, and our final kick.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A penalty kick.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Penalty kick.

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Penalty kick.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So if a player gets fouled while he is in the area near the goal, okay, he gets a penalty kick.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So basically it's just him.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I think it's 13 or 15 steps away from the goalie and he gets the opportunity to score or to kick the ball.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So there are no defenders or other players in the way.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Nobody.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wow, another great chance to score a goal.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Right.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All right, in context.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So let's listen this time a little bit slower.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Welcome back soccer fans.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My name is Rick Fields and as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman, Bob Copeland.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And we're on the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

151
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of bounds.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That will be a throw-in for Brazil.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Rubinho and the ref has called him offside.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No question about it.

155
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He was offside by a mile.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He shoots.

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Delgado takes the corner and we have a foul.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh no, Dida the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world champions.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He gets ready for the All right so we heard these words that we were talking about in context and now some really interesting phrases came up and this would be a good time to take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Fluency Builder.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well Marco there are three great phrases in this dialogue that I want to look at.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The first one, on the brink of.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We are on the brink of.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We're on the brink of.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is it?

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What exactly does that mean?

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well why don't we hear some examples to help us understand the meaning.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Example one.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Look we don't have any money.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We're on the brink of going bankrupt.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Example two.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The two countries are on the brink of war.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Example three.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We're on the brink of an important discovery.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
All right so great examples.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
On the brink of.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
At a critical point.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Exactly it means you're almost there right?

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay yeah very good and what about this next phrase that I saw and it was really interesting.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No question about it.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No question about it.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
No question about it.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No question about it.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
All right so this is a statement that doesn't really make much sense but what am I saying when I say oh no question about it.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're saying I agree there is no doubt you're right.

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're right okay.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well let's give some examples.

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I could say there's no question about it Ecuador is a great soccer team.

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
There is no question about that all right so or you can say no question about it our company makes the best products on the market.

195
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Okay so really useful phrase that you can use in sports or anywhere else.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay and now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder and it's a really good one to exaggerate a little bit.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay by a mile.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
By a mile.

199
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
By a mile.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So he was offside by a mile.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right so the commentator is saying that he was very offside.

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That it was really obvious.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Right so you can use that also in different contexts maybe not in sports.

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay so maybe we can say our company is ahead of all the others by a mile.

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right or if you tell somebody to guess your age and they say oh I think you are 42.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh you could say you're off by a mile.

207
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Right so you're really really wrong.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Exactly yeah so it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes and saying it's really obvious.

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Right well three awesome phrases and I think it will help us to hear them one more time so let's listen to the dialogue.

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Welcome back soccer fans my name is Rick Fields and as always I am joined by my commentating wingman Bob Copeland.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And we're in the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

214
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of bounds.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That will be a throw in for Brazil.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robinho and the ref has called him offside.

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No question about it he was offside by a mile.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia he shoots deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Del Gallo takes the corner we have a foul.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh no Dita the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world champions.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He gets ready for the kick he shoots and he...

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay well as you all may know soccer is a very popular sport especially in Latin America.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's right and your favorite team Ecuador are they are they really this good in soccer?

227
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Are they really gonna win the 2022 cup?

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well maybe not.

229
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well actually Ecuador has has improved with time but usually it's the strong teams like Argentina and Brazil who dominate the region right?

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Right um but yeah hopefully we'll make it next time.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay well I have my money on Ecuador and for 2022 but yeah not on Canada there's no hope for us.

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well Canada is doing really well now they actually beat Mexico if I'm not mistaken.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh actually that sort of yeah I kind of remember that now but there's I think there's no hope for us to beat Brazil or Argentina one of these big countries.

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We have the next world cup coming up so it's really exciting and I don't know who's gonna win.

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
All right well um listeners who do you think is going to win?

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Who is the best soccer team out there?

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right they're really good soccer teams although some of our some countries aren't really known for their soccer like Russia you don't really hear too much soccer from Russia really or from China is for that.

238
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
