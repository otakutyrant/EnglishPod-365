00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:04,280
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,059
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,240
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,900
And today we're bringing you another great lesson about sports, part of our sports series.

5
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:18,079
That's right, and in this lesson we are talking about maybe the world's most favorite sports.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,160
Right, one of the most popular sports in the world, soccer.

7
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:25,019
Or also known as football in other countries.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,480
Yes.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,619
Okay, so before we get started with this great lesson, let's take a look at some of the words we'll find in the dialogue in Vocabulary Preview.

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to look at three words here.

11
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,960
The first word is wingman.

12
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:43,119
Wingman.

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:43,979
A wingman.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,380
Now wingman isn't really related to soccer in any way.

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:48,899
Okay.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,060
But it's a way of referring to somebody as your right hand.

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,759
So your helper.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,299
Your helper, your number one guy.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:57,960
Okay.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,500
Right.

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,380
So a wingman is someone who helps you a lot.

22
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:03,659
Uh huh, exactly.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,680
Okay, our next word, tied.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,060
Tied.

25
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,299
They are tied.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,159
They are tied.

27
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,780
Now this is an interesting word because tie can be a noun, verb, and an adjective, right?

28
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,299
Exactly.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,560
So in this case, they are tied.

30
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:23,980
It's an adjective meaning they have the same score.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Okay.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,799
And a tie is a game that has ended with no winner or loser.

33
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,120
Both of them had the same score.

34
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:32,739
Exactly.

35
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,260
And so obviously the verb to tie is to reach the same score as your other team.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,239
Exactly.

37
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,480
Alright, well our third word can also be used as a noun and a verb and it is foul.

38
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,140
Fouled.

39
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,159
Fouled.

40
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,959
Okay, so to foul somebody is to do something to them that is not allowed in the sport.

41
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:57,760
Okay.

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,140
And so when you do this, you have committed a foul.

43
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:02,760
Exactly.

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,319
Okay, so you use it in the same way.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,980
To foul or a foul.

46
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,939
Interesting.

47
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,960
Well, we're going to hear these three words in context now.

48
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,439
So why don't we listen to our soccer dialogue?

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,819
Welcome back soccer fans.

50
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,340
My name is Rick Fields and as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman Bob Copeland.

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:45,460
And we're in the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,120
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

53
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,199
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of bounds.

54
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,800
That'll be a throw in for Brazil.

55
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,259
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robinho and the ref has called him offside.

56
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:02,979
No question about it, he was offside by a mile.

57
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:04,780
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

58
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,699
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia.

59
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:10,419
He shoots deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,879
Del Gallo takes the corner.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,020
We have a foul.

62
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,419
Oh no, Dita the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

63
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,419
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

64
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,099
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this and become world champions.

65
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,539
He gets ready for the kick.

66
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,240
He shoots and he...

67
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,180
Okay, so Ecuador tied with Brazil in the 2022 World Cup.

68
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:50,439
Wow Marco, I'm really happy to see that you are able to see so far into the future.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,379
Well, I called it so in 2022 if we do win the World Cup you know who said it first.

70
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:57,819
All right, do you have money on that?

71
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:58,460
Uh, yes.

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:07,099
All right, so apart from this we saw some really great vocabulary in this lesson so let's take a look at it now in Language Takeaway.

73
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,699
Language Takeaway.

74
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,840
All right, we've got a lot of soccer words for you but they're all important.

75
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,699
So let's take a look at the first one.

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,740
Kickoff.

77
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,199
Kickoff.

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,079
Kickoff.

79
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,420
So a kickoff.

80
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,899
This is how you start a soccer game, right?

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,000
Right, so it's the very beginning the referee blows the whistle and you kick the ball to another player.

82
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:31,699
That's the kickoff.

83
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,660
Okay, so our next phrase out of bounds.

84
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,519
Out of bounds.

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Out of bounds.

86
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,519
Okay, out of bounds.

87
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,000
This is a great word.

88
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,939
So in soccer when the ball goes out of bounds it goes outside the white lines, right?

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,459
Outside of the playing field.

90
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,660
Okay, and you can use it in all other sports.

91
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,860
You can use it in basketball.

92
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,480
You can use it in tennis or football or anything.

93
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,000
Right, so any part that is not for playing.

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,259
Out of bounds.

95
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,660
What's our next word?

96
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,120
Throw in.

97
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:05,939
A throw in.

98
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,319
A throw in.

99
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,980
Okay, so a throw in.

100
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,560
The ball goes out of bounds.

101
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,500
How do you put it back into play?

102
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,459
Obviously, a throw in.

103
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,639
Okay, so you throw in the ball.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,759
That's the only time where a soccer player will actually grab the ball with his hands.

105
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,199
All right, now another soccer term we have here.

106
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,079
Offside.

107
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:26,699
Offside.

108
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:27,540
Offside.

109
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,300
Okay, so this is a soccer field, and you are trying to score a goal.

110
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,360
Now you have some defenders, right?

111
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:45,800
Those are the people who are trying to take the ball away, and you pass the ball to somebody who is behind the defenders.

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,379
Oh, and that person is offside.

113
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:56,740
Exactly, so you must be at all times in the same position as the defenders or in front of them, but you can't be all the way in the back.

114
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,339
Okay, so is this a noun or a verb or an adjective?

115
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,100
So this is an adjective.

116
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
He is offside.

117
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:04,379
That's his condition.

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,339
Okay, great.

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,120
Excellent explanation, Marco.

120
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:07,560
Thank you.

121
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:15,180
All right, now we're going to look at three different phrases for three types of kicks in soccer.

122
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, so let's take a look at this.

123
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,040
The first one is goal kick.

124
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,220
A goal kick.

125
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,759
Okay, goal kick.

126
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,519
So who does the goal kick?

127
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,180
It's a keeper who takes the goal kick.

128
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,500
Okay, so when the goalie kicks the ball.

129
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,660
Now, what about a corner kick?

130
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:45,480
Okay, so if the team is attacking and the ball goes out of bounds in the back area near the goal, then they get a corner kick.

131
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,779
They gotta kick the ball from the corner of the field.

132
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,100
This is a great chance to score a goal, isn't it?

133
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,019
Exactly, yes.

134
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,639
Okay, and our final kick.

135
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:55,199
A penalty kick.

136
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:56,779
Penalty kick.

137
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:57,600
Penalty kick.

138
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:03,819
So if a player gets fouled while he is in the area near the goal, okay, he gets a penalty kick.

139
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,240
So basically it's just him.

140
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:12,720
I think it's 13 or 15 steps away from the goalie and he gets the opportunity to score or to kick the ball.

141
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,259
So there are no defenders or other players in the way.

142
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Nobody.

143
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,620
Wow, another great chance to score a goal.

144
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,079
Right.

145
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,339
All right, in context.

146
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,379
So let's listen this time a little bit slower.

147
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,839
Welcome back soccer fans.

148
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:43,800
My name is Rick Fields and as always, I am joined by my commentating wingman, Bob Copeland.

149
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:59,259
And we're on the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

150
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,519
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

151
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of bounds.

152
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,000
That will be a throw-in for Brazil.

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,879
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Rubinho and the ref has called him offside.

154
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,839
No question about it.

155
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,939
He was offside by a mile.

156
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,199
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

157
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,040
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia.

158
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:31,220
He shoots.

159
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,460
Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

160
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,460
Delgado takes the corner and we have a foul.

161
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,159
Oh no, Dida the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

162
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,220
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

163
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,419
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world champions.

164
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:15,720
He gets ready for the All right so we heard these words that we were talking about in context and now some really interesting phrases came up and this would be a good time to take a look at them in Fluency Builder.

165
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:17,820
Fluency Builder.

166
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,779
Well Marco there are three great phrases in this dialogue that I want to look at.

167
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,700
The first one, on the brink of.

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,519
We are on the brink of.

169
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,779
We're on the brink of.

170
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:35,220
What is it?

171
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,379
What exactly does that mean?

172
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,000
Well why don't we hear some examples to help us understand the meaning.

173
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,179
Example one.

174
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,220
Look we don't have any money.

175
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,320
We're on the brink of going bankrupt.

176
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,860
Example two.

177
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,460
The two countries are on the brink of war.

178
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,779
Example three.

179
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:01,200
We're on the brink of an important discovery.

180
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,379
All right so great examples.

181
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,460
On the brink of.

182
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,580
At a critical point.

183
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,220
Exactly it means you're almost there right?

184
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:16,480
Okay yeah very good and what about this next phrase that I saw and it was really interesting.

185
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:18,559
No question about it.

186
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,879
No question about it.

187
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
No question about it.

188
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,679
No question about it.

189
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:31,740
All right so this is a statement that doesn't really make much sense but what am I saying when I say oh no question about it.

190
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:35,379
You're saying I agree there is no doubt you're right.

191
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,159
You're right okay.

192
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:38,539
Well let's give some examples.

193
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,740
I could say there's no question about it Ecuador is a great soccer team.

194
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:52,980
There is no question about that all right so or you can say no question about it our company makes the best products on the market.

195
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:58,039
Okay so really useful phrase that you can use in sports or anywhere else.

196
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:05,000
Okay and now let's take a look at our last phrase for Fluency Builder and it's a really good one to exaggerate a little bit.

197
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,820
Okay by a mile.

198
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,080
By a mile.

199
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,620
By a mile.

200
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,179
So he was offside by a mile.

201
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,820
Right so the commentator is saying that he was very offside.

202
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,120
That it was really obvious.

203
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,840
Right so you can use that also in different contexts maybe not in sports.

204
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:29,740
Okay so maybe we can say our company is ahead of all the others by a mile.

205
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,159
Right or if you tell somebody to guess your age and they say oh I think you are 42.

206
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,240
Oh you could say you're off by a mile.

207
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,279
Right so you're really really wrong.

208
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,460
Exactly yeah so it's a way of exaggerating a little bit.

209
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes and saying it's really obvious.

210
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:53,379
Right well three awesome phrases and I think it will help us to hear them one more time so let's listen to the dialogue.

211
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,980
Welcome back soccer fans my name is Rick Fields and as always I am joined by my commentating wingman Bob Copeland.

212
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:25,019
And we're in the brink of soccer history today as Ecuador and Brazil are tied 1-1 as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup.

213
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,740
The ref calls the players for the kickoff and here we go.

214
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,820
Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield but oh it's out of bounds.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,419
That will be a throw in for Brazil.

216
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,879
Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robinho and the ref has called him offside.

217
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,639
No question about it he was offside by a mile.

218
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,379
We have a goal kick for Ecuador.

219
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:50,039
Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia he shoots deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick.

220
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,620
Del Gallo takes the corner we have a foul.

221
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,039
Oh no Dita the goalkeeper has fouled the Ecuadorian player.

222
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,039
He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick.

223
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,740
This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become world champions.

224
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,899
He gets ready for the kick he shoots and he...

225
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:25,899
Okay well as you all may know soccer is a very popular sport especially in Latin America.

226
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,120
That's right and your favorite team Ecuador are they are they really this good in soccer?

227
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,440
Are they really gonna win the 2022 cup?

228
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,379
Well maybe not.

229
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:45,659
Well actually Ecuador has has improved with time but usually it's the strong teams like Argentina and Brazil who dominate the region right?

230
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,720
Right um but yeah hopefully we'll make it next time.

231
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:55,980
Okay well I have my money on Ecuador and for 2022 but yeah not on Canada there's no hope for us.

232
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,779
Well Canada is doing really well now they actually beat Mexico if I'm not mistaken.

233
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,519
Oh actually that sort of yeah I kind of remember that now but there's I think there's no hope for us to beat Brazil or Argentina one of these big countries.

234
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,960
We have the next world cup coming up so it's really exciting and I don't know who's gonna win.

235
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,259
All right well um listeners who do you think is going to win?

236
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,120
Who is the best soccer team out there?

237
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:30,899
Right they're really good soccer teams although some of our some countries aren't really known for their soccer like Russia you don't really hear too much soccer from Russia really or from China is for that.

238
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,860
