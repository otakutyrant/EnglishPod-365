1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And today we're swimming.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That's right.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A nice summertime lesson for everyone.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
A summertime lesson.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we're going to be talking about swimming and, well, it's a very popular sport, right?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So this is another lesson in our sports series.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In our sports series.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So why don't we preview some of the language we'll find in the dialogue.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Vocabulary Preview All right.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We have two words to look at here.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The first word is sailing.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Sailing.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Sailing.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Sailing.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, this is the verb to sail, right?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So sailing is travelling in a boat.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In a boat with no engine.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Right.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So you must use the wind to push you forward.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Exactly.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's a sailboat.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So sailing.

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now let's take a look at our other word, anchor.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Another boat word here.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Anchor.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Anchor.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Anchor.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now it's spelled A-N-C-H-O-R.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Right.

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But you don't pronounce the C-H as you normally would, right?

39
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Another one of these really difficult to spell English words.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Right.

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So you don't say anchor, you would say anchor.

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Anchor.

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Anchor.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Anchor.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So the anchor is a verb and a noun.

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, when anchor is used as a noun, it means the hook that you throw over the boat into the water and it keeps you staying in the same place.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Okay.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But the verb to anchor.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What does it mean?

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
To do that.

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
To do that.

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Right?

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So to throw the anchor into the water, you would just say to anchor the boat.

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Exactly.

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
To keep it in the same place.

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

59
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Great words related to sailing.

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's happening here, Erica?

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, we've got two friends here who are sailing in their boat and they decide to take a swim.

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's see what happens.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are you doggy paddling?

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I taught you how to swim.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do your breaststroke.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I get too tired.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll just backstroke.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's easier.

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Try kicking your legs more.

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's good.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't go out too far.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's fine.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Jump in.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Kathy, get back here.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I see a shark.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Help me!

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Help!

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Bring the boat closer.

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The shark is coming straight towards me!

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's right under you!

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Kathy!

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
All right.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So a shark attack.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I know.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is my worst fear when swimming.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In the ocean, right?

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, also in the lake, but...

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No sharks in lakes.

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I know, but I'm still afraid of them.

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right.

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So don't worry about it.

95
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sure the girl is okay.

96
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's probably not a shark.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe it was a dolphin.

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

99
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Or maybe she's going to punch the shark in the face and she'll escape.

100
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's take a look at some of the words that we saw in Language Takeaway.

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We have three excellent swimming words for you.

103
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The first one is doggy paddling.

104
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Doggy paddling.

105
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Doggy paddling.

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So doggy paddling.

107
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's not really a proper way of swimming, right?

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No.

109
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You don't see this in the Olympics.

110
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So if you've ever seen a dog swim, that's why they call it doggy paddling.

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're sort of moving your hands quickly in front of you.

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And your legs are all over the place.

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you're basically not really swimming.

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're just trying to stay afloat.

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're trying not to drown.

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Trying not to sink.

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah.

119
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yep.

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay.

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So doggy paddling.

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Again, this can be a noun or a verb.

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The doggy paddle.

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This swimming style.

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Or doggy paddling.

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The verb.

127
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Interesting.

128
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Interesting.

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
All right.

130
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's take a look at our second swimming style.

131
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Breaststroke.

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Breaststroke.

133
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Breaststroke.

134
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The breaststroke.

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How is this one?

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, it's sort of like swimming like a frog.

137
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So you have your legs that are similar to like a frog, right?

138
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And what are your hands doing?

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Your hands are moving in front of you together, then out towards the side.

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So you're kind of doing like circles.

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Half circles.

142
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Half circles.

143
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

144
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Breaststroke.

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you get kind of tired when you swim like this, right?

147
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, maybe.

148
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

149
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now let's take a look at our third word.

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Backstroke.

152
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Backstroke.

153
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Backstroke.

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Backstroke.

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this one's pretty easy.

156
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Backstroke.

157
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are?

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Lying on your back.

159
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're lying on your back.

160
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In the water.

161
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And you're kicking your feet as well.

162
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yep.

163
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
But what are your hands doing?

164
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They're going back behind you.

165
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
See, I'm doing it now.

166
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,000
See?

167
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Alright, if you guys could be here in the studio, you would see Erika doing her backstroke.

168
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, I'm pretty good at it.

169
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

170
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is such a beautiful day.

171
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Great day for sailing.

172
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It sure is.

173
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The water looks so nice.

174
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Anchor the boat for a little while.

175
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm going to take a dip.

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why are you doggy paddling?

177
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I taught you how to swim.

178
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do your breaststroke.

179
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I get too tired.

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll just backstroke.

181
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's easier.

182
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Try kicking your legs more.

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's good.

184
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't go out too far.

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's fine.

186
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Jump in!

187
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Kathy!

188
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Get back here.

189
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I see a shark.

190
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Help me!

191
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Help!

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Bring the boat closer!

193
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The shark is coming straight towards me!

194
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's right under you!

195
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kathy!

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay, so we have some really good phrases related to swimming and water.

197
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay, let's take a look at these in Fluency Builder.

198
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Fluency Builder.

199
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Alright, the first one.

200
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I love this phrase.

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Take a dip.

202
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Take a dip.

203
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Take a dip.

204
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So if I say I'm going to take a dip.

205
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're going to have a quick swim.

206
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A quick swim.

207
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yep.

208
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So you can take a dip in the pool.

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yep.

210
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
In the lake.

211
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In the ocean.

212
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
In the ocean.

213
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Even in your bathtub, right?

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No.

215
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
No?

216
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, it's just for swimming.

217
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Unless your bathtub is really, really, really big.

218
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Alright, so not for the bathtub, but for swimming.

219
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yep.

220
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay.

221
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Now let's take a look at our second phrase.

222
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For a little while.

223
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For a little while.

224
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
For a little while.

225
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
For a little while.

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is really common.

227
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I use this a lot.

228
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yeah, me too.

229
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I probably use it 500 times a day.

230
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, so let's listen to some examples with for a little while, and then we'll come back and explain it.

231
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Example one.

232
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm tired.

233
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm just going to sit down for a little while.

234
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Example two.

235
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It will only hurt for a little while.

236
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Example three.

237
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you want to play tennis for a little while?

238
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So it means for a short time.

239
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
For a short time.

240
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And you can change it, right?

241
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can say, oh, I'm going to play for a little while.

242
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah.

243
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Or I'm going to sleep for a little while.

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
For a short time.

245
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yep.

246
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Alright, so if learners use this phrase, I find it sounds really, really great, because it's not something that students normally use.

247
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, I guess a student wouldn't really use this phrase normally.

248
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, so guys, use it, because you'll sound awesome.

249
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, you'll sound really, really fluent.

250
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, and let's take a look at our last phrase.

251
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Straight towards.

252
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Straight towards.

253
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Straight towards me.

254
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Straight towards.

255
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okay, so straight means directly.

256
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right, in a line.

257
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
In a line.

258
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Not going anywhere else, but directly.

259
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Not moving side to side.

260
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And towards is in that direction.

261
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So, the shark was coming straight towards me, it's coming directly at me.

262
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Moving in a line and not moving side to side.

263
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, so can you give me another example of how you would use straight towards?

264
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Watch out!

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There's a car coming straight towards you.

266
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Okay, directly towards you.

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or maybe when I get home from work, I go straight towards the fridge.

268
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Really?

269
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

270
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I believe this.

271
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Alright, so straight towards, directly.

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay, so we've looked at a lot of great words, really good phrases.

273
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time, and then we'll come back.

274
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And Eric is going to tell us a really great story about boats.

275
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is such a beautiful day.

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Great day for sailing.

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It sure is.

278
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The water looks so nice.

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Anchor the boat for a little while.

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going to take a dip.

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why are you doggy paddling?

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I taught you how to swim.

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Do your breast stroke.

284
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I get too tired.

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll just backstroke, it's easier.

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Try kicking your legs more.

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's good.

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't go out too far.

289
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's fine.

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Jump in.

291
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Kathy, get back here.

292
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I see a shark.

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Help me!

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Help!

295
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Bring the boat closer.

296
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The shark is coming straight towards me.

297
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's right under you.

298
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Kathy!

299
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Alright, well Marco, I was telling you that I used to spend every summer on the lake.

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And my family had a really small house on a small island.

301
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And my cousins had another small house on another small island.

302
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So our families are really close and we used to go to one house for dinner one night and the other house for dinner the next night.

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So everyone was over at my cousin's house, except for my grandfather.

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And so he was thinking, okay, it's late, maybe I better go pick up my wife and see what's going on.

305
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So he goes into the boat.

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's dark.

307
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's no light on the boat.

309
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's driving straight towards the island when suddenly my cousin in his boat drives directly into my grandfather.

310
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So they crashed.

311
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They crashed.

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Two boats crashed in the lake.

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And then my grandfather's boat flipped over.

314
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It turned upside down.

315
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And he fell in the water.

316
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But he was okay, right?

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, he was okay.

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But you know what?

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He was really angry about this.

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And the boat?

321
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The boat stayed in the water and the engine fell down to the bottom.

322
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So we had to go the next morning to get the boat.

323
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
And we actually had to hire some scuba divers to go to the bottom of the lake to get the engine.

324
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Wow.

325
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I imagine your grandpa was pretty angry.

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah, he tells the story.

328
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Every year.

329
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, exactly.

330
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But you know what?

331
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've got a million of these crazy lake stories because my family just- It always happens.

332
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yeah.

333
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
All right, guys.

334
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, do you have any crazy stories or any stories related to boats or to swimming?

335
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or to shark attacks?

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Or shark attacks?

337
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah.

338
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000

Bye.

350

Bye.

352

Bye.

353
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Bye.

354
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bye.

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bye.

356
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bye.
