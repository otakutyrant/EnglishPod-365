1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,700
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,440
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,580
And I'm Erika.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,740
And today we're swimming.

6
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,800
That's right.

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,779
A nice summertime lesson for everyone.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,380
A summertime lesson.

9
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,379
So we're going to be talking about swimming and, well, it's a very popular sport, right?

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:18,660
Yeah.

11
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,379
So this is another lesson in our sports series.

12
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,320
In our sports series.

13
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:23,760
Okay.

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,519
So why don't we preview some of the language we'll find in the dialogue.

15
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,260
Vocabulary Preview All right.

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:33,979
We have two words to look at here.

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,320
The first word is sailing.

18
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,380
Sailing.

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,259
Sailing.

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,340
Sailing.

21
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, this is the verb to sail, right?

22
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,859
So sailing is travelling in a boat.

23
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,079
In a boat with no engine.

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:49,679
Right.

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,520
So you must use the wind to push you forward.

26
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:53,140
Exactly.

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,060
That's a sailboat.

28
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:54,439
Yes.

29
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:54,979
Okay.

30
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,840
So sailing.

31
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,380
Now let's take a look at our other word, anchor.

32
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,979
Another boat word here.

33
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:01,840
Anchor.

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,840
Anchor.

35
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:03,859
Anchor.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,200
Now it's spelled A-N-C-H-O-R.

37
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,599
Right.

38
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,719
But you don't pronounce the C-H as you normally would, right?

39
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,819
Another one of these really difficult to spell English words.

40
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,239
Right.

41
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:18,900
So you don't say anchor, you would say anchor.

42
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,859
Anchor.

43
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,519
Anchor.

44
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,120
Anchor.

45
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,640
So the anchor is a verb and a noun.

46
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,159
That's right.

47
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:33,760
Well, when anchor is used as a noun, it means the hook that you throw over the boat into the water and it keeps you staying in the same place.

48
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,280
Okay.

49
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,340
But the verb to anchor.

50
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:36,799
Yes.

51
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,700
What does it mean?

52
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,599
To do that.

53
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,319
To do that.

54
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:39,599
Right?

55
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,159
So to throw the anchor into the water, you would just say to anchor the boat.

56
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:45,599
Exactly.

57
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,459
To keep it in the same place.

58
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,219
Okay.

59
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,579
Great words related to sailing.

60
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,299
But now let's listen to our dialogue for the first time.

61
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,739
What's happening here, Erica?

62
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,719
Well, we've got two friends here who are sailing in their boat and they decide to take a swim.

63
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,719
Let's see what happens.

64
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,879
Why are you doggy paddling?

65
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,159
I taught you how to swim.

66
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,000
Do your breaststroke.

67
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,620
I get too tired.

68
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,900
I'll just backstroke.

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,699
It's easier.

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,740
Try kicking your legs more.

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,219
That's good.

72
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Don't go out too far.

73
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,439
It's fine.

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,860
Jump in.

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,280
Kathy, get back here.

76
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,120
I see a shark.

77
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,539
Help me!

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,460
Help!

79
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,219
Bring the boat closer.

80
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,479
The shark is coming straight towards me!

81
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,259
It's right under you!

82
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,020
Kathy!

83
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,259
All right.

84
00:03:04,419 --> 00:03:05,560
So a shark attack.

85
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,639
I know.

86
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,319
This is my worst fear when swimming.

87
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:09,840
Really?

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,120
In the ocean, right?

89
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:11,439
Yeah.

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,300
Well, also in the lake, but...

91
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,259
No sharks in lakes.

92
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,560
I know, but I'm still afraid of them.

93
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:17,979
All right.

94
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,379
So don't worry about it.

95
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,599
I'm sure the girl is okay.

96
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,360
It's probably not a shark.

97
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Maybe it was a dolphin.

98
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:23,759
Yeah.

99
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,639
Or maybe she's going to punch the shark in the face and she'll escape.

100
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:28,620
Okay.

101
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,300
Let's take a look at some of the words that we saw in Language Takeaway.

102
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:39,159
We have three excellent swimming words for you.

103
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,680
The first one is doggy paddling.

104
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,900
Doggy paddling.

105
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,919
Doggy paddling.

106
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,520
So doggy paddling.

107
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,139
It's not really a proper way of swimming, right?

108
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,620
No.

109
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,520
You don't see this in the Olympics.

110
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,099
So if you've ever seen a dog swim, that's why they call it doggy paddling.

111
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,340
Right.

112
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,460
You're sort of moving your hands quickly in front of you.

113
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,300
And your legs are all over the place.

114
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,319
And you're basically not really swimming.

115
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,620
You're just trying to stay afloat.

116
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
You're trying not to drown.

117
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,080
Trying not to sink.

118
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:07,599
Yeah.

119
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:08,099
Yep.

120
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,560
Okay.

121
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:09,580
So doggy paddling.

122
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,919
Again, this can be a noun or a verb.

123
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,340
The doggy paddle.

124
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,219
This swimming style.

125
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,699
Or doggy paddling.

126
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,240
The verb.

127
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:18,180
Interesting.

128
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:18,319
Interesting.

129
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:19,319
All right.

130
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,160
Let's take a look at our second swimming style.

131
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,319
Breaststroke.

132
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,600
Breaststroke.

133
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,480
Breaststroke.

134
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:26,699
The breaststroke.

135
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,040
How is this one?

136
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,459
Well, it's sort of like swimming like a frog.

137
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,600
So you have your legs that are similar to like a frog, right?

138
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,819
And what are your hands doing?

139
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,120
Your hands are moving in front of you together, then out towards the side.

140
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,560
So you're kind of doing like circles.

141
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,680
Half circles.

142
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,420
Half circles.

143
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:48,540
Okay.

144
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,620
Breaststroke.

145
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:49,939
Yeah.

146
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,439
But you get kind of tired when you swim like this, right?

147
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah, maybe.

148
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:53,939
Yeah.

149
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:54,480
Yeah.

150
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,160
Now let's take a look at our third word.

151
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,740
Backstroke.

152
00:04:59,459 --> 00:04:59,899
Backstroke.

153
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Backstroke.

154
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:01,779
Backstroke.

155
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,199
So this one's pretty easy.

156
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:03,879
Backstroke.

157
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,699
You are?

158
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,800
Lying on your back.

159
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,639
You're lying on your back.

160
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,139
In the water.

161
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,699
And you're kicking your feet as well.

162
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:10,040
Yep.

163
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,620
But what are your hands doing?

164
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,519
They're going back behind you.

165
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,740
See, I'm doing it now.

166
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:15,120
See?

167
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,800
Alright, if you guys could be here in the studio, you would see Erika doing her backstroke.

168
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,899
Yeah, I'm pretty good at it.

169
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,560
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue again, and then we'll come back and look at some great phrases.

170
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,920
This is such a beautiful day.

171
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,019
Great day for sailing.

172
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,920
It sure is.

173
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,220
The water looks so nice.

174
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,259
Anchor the boat for a little while.

175
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,240
I'm going to take a dip.

176
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,560
Why are you doggy paddling?

177
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,259
I taught you how to swim.

178
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,040
Do your breaststroke.

179
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,120
I get too tired.

180
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,079
I'll just backstroke.

181
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,339
It's easier.

182
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:01,540
Try kicking your legs more.

183
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,980
That's good.

184
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:04,740
Don't go out too far.

185
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,379
It's fine.

186
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,220
Jump in!

187
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,220
Kathy!

188
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Get back here.

189
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,160
I see a shark.

190
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,180
Help me!

191
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,639
Help!

192
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,459
Bring the boat closer!

193
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,939
The shark is coming straight towards me!

194
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,839
It's right under you!

195
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:25,779
Kathy!

196
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,560
Okay, so we have some really good phrases related to swimming and water.

197
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:38,160
Okay, let's take a look at these in Fluency Builder.

198
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,100
Fluency Builder.

199
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,620
Alright, the first one.

200
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,879
I love this phrase.

201
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:45,040
Take a dip.

202
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,180
Take a dip.

203
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:46,980
Take a dip.

204
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,740
So if I say I'm going to take a dip.

205
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,740
You're going to have a quick swim.

206
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:53,459
A quick swim.

207
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:53,720
Yep.

208
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,920
So you can take a dip in the pool.

209
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,300
Yep.

210
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,279
In the lake.

211
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,019
In the ocean.

212
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,600
In the ocean.

213
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:00,480
Even in your bathtub, right?

214
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,040
No.

215
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,399
No?

216
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,519
No, it's just for swimming.

217
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,899
Unless your bathtub is really, really, really big.

218
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,540
Alright, so not for the bathtub, but for swimming.

219
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:09,920
Yep.

220
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:10,839
Okay.

221
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,420
Now let's take a look at our second phrase.

222
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,060
For a little while.

223
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,079
For a little while.

224
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,540
For a little while.

225
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,319
For a little while.

226
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,959
This is really common.

227
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,699
I use this a lot.

228
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:21,300
Yeah, me too.

229
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,160
I probably use it 500 times a day.

230
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,100
Okay, so let's listen to some examples with for a little while, and then we'll come back and explain it.

231
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:31,560
Example one.

232
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,319
I'm tired.

233
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,100
I'm just going to sit down for a little while.

234
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Example two.

235
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,199
It will only hurt for a little while.

236
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Example three.

237
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:46,980
Do you want to play tennis for a little while?

238
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,639
So it means for a short time.

239
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:51,540
For a short time.

240
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,519
And you can change it, right?

241
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:55,439
You can say, oh, I'm going to play for a little while.

242
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:55,740
Yeah.

243
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,100
Or I'm going to sleep for a little while.

244
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,480
For a short time.

245
00:07:59,660 --> 00:07:59,759
Yep.

246
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:08,120
Alright, so if learners use this phrase, I find it sounds really, really great, because it's not something that students normally use.

247
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:11,279
Yeah, I guess a student wouldn't really use this phrase normally.

248
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah, so guys, use it, because you'll sound awesome.

249
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:15,740
Yeah, you'll sound really, really fluent.

250
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,860
Okay, and let's take a look at our last phrase.

251
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,500
Straight towards.

252
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:21,819
Straight towards.

253
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:23,420
Straight towards me.

254
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,480
Straight towards.

255
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,779
Okay, so straight means directly.

256
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,860
Right, in a line.

257
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,399
In a line.

258
00:08:30,459 --> 00:08:31,959
Not going anywhere else, but directly.

259
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,580
Not moving side to side.

260
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,200
And towards is in that direction.

261
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,419
So, the shark was coming straight towards me, it's coming directly at me.

262
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,679
Moving in a line and not moving side to side.

263
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, so can you give me another example of how you would use straight towards?

264
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,399
Watch out!

265
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,259
There's a car coming straight towards you.

266
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,179
Okay, directly towards you.

267
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,799
Or maybe when I get home from work, I go straight towards the fridge.

268
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,360
Really?

269
00:08:59,519 --> 00:08:59,840
Yes.

270
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,899
I believe this.

271
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:03,860
Alright, so straight towards, directly.

272
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,580
Okay, so we've looked at a lot of great words, really good phrases.

273
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,299
Let's listen to this dialogue one last time, and then we'll come back.

274
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,100
And Eric is going to tell us a really great story about boats.

275
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,259
This is such a beautiful day.

276
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,480
Great day for sailing.

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,120
It sure is.

278
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,759
The water looks so nice.

279
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,600
Anchor the boat for a little while.

280
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,159
I'm going to take a dip.

281
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,039
Why are you doggy paddling?

282
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,340
I taught you how to swim.

283
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,220
Do your breast stroke.

284
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,820
I get too tired.

285
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
I'll just backstroke, it's easier.

286
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,940
Try kicking your legs more.

287
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,399
That's good.

288
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
Don't go out too far.

289
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,620
It's fine.

290
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,039
Jump in.

291
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,460
Kathy, get back here.

292
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,360
I see a shark.

293
00:10:00,619 --> 00:10:01,779
Help me!

294
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,639
Help!

295
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,419
Bring the boat closer.

296
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,600
The shark is coming straight towards me.

297
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:09,379
It's right under you.

298
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:10,200
Kathy!

299
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:19,360
Alright, well Marco, I was telling you that I used to spend every summer on the lake.

300
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,159
And my family had a really small house on a small island.

301
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,639
And my cousins had another small house on another small island.

302
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:39,580
So our families are really close and we used to go to one house for dinner one night and the other house for dinner the next night.

303
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,899
So everyone was over at my cousin's house, except for my grandfather.

304
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:52,659
And so he was thinking, okay, it's late, maybe I better go pick up my wife and see what's going on.

305
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,379
So he goes into the boat.

306
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,620
It's dark.

307
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,279
Okay.

308
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,840
There's no light on the boat.

309
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:07,659
He's driving straight towards the island when suddenly my cousin in his boat drives directly into my grandfather.

310
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:08,960
So they crashed.

311
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,740
They crashed.

312
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,299
Two boats crashed in the lake.

313
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:14,899
And then my grandfather's boat flipped over.

314
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,440
It turned upside down.

315
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
And he fell in the water.

316
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,019
But he was okay, right?

317
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:20,759
Yeah, he was okay.

318
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,259
But you know what?

319
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,139
He was really angry about this.

320
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,480
And the boat?

321
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,659
The boat stayed in the water and the engine fell down to the bottom.

322
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,220
So we had to go the next morning to get the boat.

323
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,399
And we actually had to hire some scuba divers to go to the bottom of the lake to get the engine.

324
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:40,960
Wow.

325
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah.

326
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:44,519
I imagine your grandpa was pretty angry.

327
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:46,299
Yeah, he tells the story.

328
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,460
Every year.

329
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,519
Yeah, exactly.

330
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,220
But you know what?

331
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,159
I've got a million of these crazy lake stories because my family just- It always happens.

332
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:56,779
Yeah.

333
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,480
All right, guys.

334
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,919
Well, do you have any crazy stories or any stories related to boats or to swimming?

335
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940
Or to shark attacks?

336
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,899
Or shark attacks?

337
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:05,179
Yeah.

338
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,589

Bye.

350

Bye.

353
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:22,370
Bye.

354
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:24,169
Bye.

355
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:24,669
Bye.

356
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:24,970
Bye.
