00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:08,279
EnglishPod.com Very good.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,039
Now I have a couple of final questions.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,199
I hope they're not too hard.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,480
Well, why should we hire you?

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,059
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

6
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:26,440
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,500
I excel at building strong, long-term consumer relationships.

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,380
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team resolved about 70% of our customers' problems.

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,520
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

10
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:50,700
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

11
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:54,859
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,479
Impressive.

13
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,219
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,579
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

15
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,859
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,140
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,239
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,920
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,799
So I think I'm getting better now.

20
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,159
Great.

21
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,780
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,260
We are short-listing our candidates this week.

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,579
And next week, we will inform our short-listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,540
Great.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,200
Thanks a lot.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,579
I hope to hear from you.

27
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:48,079
Goodbye.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,560
Thank you.
