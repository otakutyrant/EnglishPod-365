00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
EnglishPod.com Very good.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now I have a couple of final questions.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I hope they're not too hard.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, why should we hire you?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I excel at building strong, long-term consumer relationships.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team resolved about 70% of our customers' problems.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Impressive.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So I think I'm getting better now.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Great.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We are short-listing our candidates this week.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And next week, we will inform our short-listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Great.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thanks a lot.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I hope to hear from you.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Goodbye.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you.
