00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,200
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:05,860
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:06,919
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:10,400
And we're bringing you the final lesson of our job interview series.

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,060
That's right.

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,039
And in this lesson, we're going to be focusing on two very, very common but sometimes difficult questions.

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:18,719
Okay.

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,640
So we've talked about preparing for the job interview in part one.

10
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,280
Part two, we talked about educational background and work experience.

11
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,899
And in part three, what are we going to be looking at?

12
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,320
We're going to be looking at two questions, why we should hire you, and your greatest weakness.

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,200
Okay.

14
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,600
So these are the classic common questions that you'll get at a job interview, right?

15
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,240
That's right.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:48,600
So why don't we just get started and we'll take a listen to the dialogue and see how our interviewee handles these questions.

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,560
Very good.

18
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:01,320
Now, I have a couple of final questions.

19
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:02,460
I hope they're not too hard.

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,739
Well, why should we hire you?

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,340
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,700
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

23
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:20,780
You know, I excel at building strong long-term consumer relationships.

24
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:27,659
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team resolved about 70% of our customers' problems.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,780
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:40,959
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

27
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,239
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

28
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:48,739
Impressive.

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,480
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,859
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

31
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,140
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

32
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,420
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

33
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,540
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:16,080
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better now.

35
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,400
Great.

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,060
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

37
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:34,860
We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short-listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

38
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,500
Great, thanks a lot.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,939
I hope to hear from you.

40
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,379
Goodbye.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,360
Well, our interviewee is doing very well, but I think he had a little bit too many beans or chili.

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,900
Oh my god, this is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of.

43
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,419
But he doesn't say anything, so I don't know.

44
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:04,020
Maybe he should have said, oh pardon me, excuse me.

45
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:06,319
I don't know, it's a controversy.

46
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,280
Yeah, okay, but what isn't a controversy is the language because there's some great stuff in here.

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,099
All right, so let's take a look at the language in Language Takeaway.

48
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:18,699
Language Takeaway.

49
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:30,919
All right, we've got some great phrases and words for you to use when you're talking about what sort of benefits and skills and experience and expertise you can bring to a company.

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,900
Okay, the first thing that he said, and it's a very interesting word, he said technical acumen.

51
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,120
Technical acumen.

52
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,139
Acumen.

53
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:40,860
Acumen.

54
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:42,819
This is a really hard word.

55
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,879
What is acumen?

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:53,580
It's basically insight and understanding and the ability to make good and difficult decisions.

57
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:57,780
Okay, so he has a very strong technical acumen.

58
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,740
So a strong insight or understanding of technical issues.

59
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:07,240
Okay, or I can change it and maybe say, I have a very strong business acumen.

60
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:07,919
Exactly.

61
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:10,699
These are the two most common ways that this word is used.

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,719
Technical acumen, business acumen.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,759
Okay, great.

64
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:18,399
Now let's take a look at another word which is very interesting because everybody knows it.

65
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:18,939
Yes.

66
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,759
Excel.

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,399
Excel.

68
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,420
Excel.

69
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:26,060
Now Excel is of course the software that you use, right?

70
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,420
Yeah, but here it's a verb meaning to be really, really good at something.

71
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,000
Right, to be the best maybe.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah.

73
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,899
To excel at something.

74
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,240
Yes, so I excel at cooking.

75
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:41,899
All right, so Excel, you are the best.

76
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,160
I mean that's not really gonna help me in a job interview, but the next word might.

77
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,860
Head.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:48,720
Head.

79
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,879
Well in the dialogue we heard it as headed in the past, right?

80
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,500
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,139
He headed the customer support department.

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,639
So I think this is a great word to use when you were saying I was the leader.

83
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,420
Mm-hmm.

84
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,779
I was the main person in charge.

85
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:07,699
Yeah, the manager.

86
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:08,680
Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,939
So this is a nice verb to use to show that you were leading something.

88
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:13,639
Okay.

89
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,399
Okay, now for the next word.

90
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,120
Struggle.

91
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:19,600
To struggle.

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Struggle.

93
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,160
Struggle.

94
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,120
So what does struggle mean?

95
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,639
It means that you have difficulty doing something.

96
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,839
So it's hard for you.

97
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,560
For example, when I was in school I struggled with math.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, and now I struggle with Chinese.

100
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,300
Exactly, so to have a hard time.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,180
Yeah, why don't we hear a couple of examples of how this word is used.

102
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,139
Example one.

103
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,959
We're really struggling to reach our sales target.

104
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,860
Example two.

105
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,319
Yeah, to be honest, I do struggle with time management.

106
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,060
Example three.

107
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,160
The teacher farted in class and I really had to struggle not to laugh.

108
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:21,879
Okay, so great examples.

109
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,680
Let's move on to our next word.

110
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,759
Punctuality.

111
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,959
Punctuality.

112
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,660
Punctuality.

113
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,680
Punctuality.

114
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, so to be punctual.

115
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,779
It means to be on time, always.

116
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:35,680
Always.

117
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,279
So punctuality would be noun form.

118
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,300
Right, so the condition or the state of always being on time.

119
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,120
Right, so punctuality.

120
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,339
To be punctual.

121
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,019
Yeah, and our interviewee struggles with punctuality.

122
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:51,980
Right, like me.

123
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:55,339
I guess you guys have something in common.

124
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,019
We do.

125
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,620
Now, he has a problem with punctuality, but he said he has addressed this weakness.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,800
Yes, to address.

127
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:05,819
Address.

128
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:06,279
Address.

129
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,480
Now, if you notice, it's spelled the same way as address.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,339
That's right.

131
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,079
But you pronounce it differently.

132
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,819
The verb address has the stress on the second syllable.

133
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,259
Okay, address.

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,079
Yes, and that means to deal with the problem.

135
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,980
Yeah, to acknowledge the problem and to try and solve it and to try and solve it.

136
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,079
Okay, so different from your home address where you live.

137
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,019
Yeah, and there the stress is on the first syllable.

138
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,579
Address.

139
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,040
Right.

140
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:35,939
Perfect.

141
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,339
Very good.

142
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,899
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue one more time, and then we'll come back and talk about these two questions.

143
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,899
Greatest weakness and why should we hire you?

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,060
Very good.

145
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,800
Now, I have a couple of final questions.

146
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:58,959
I hope they're not too hard.

147
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,279
Well, why should we hire you?

148
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,839
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

149
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,180
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

150
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,300
You know, I excel at building strong, long-term consumer relationships.

151
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:29,279
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team resolved about 70% of our information and technical preparation on our products.

152
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:37,460
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,659
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

154
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,259
Impressive.

155
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,000
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

156
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,320
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,639
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

158
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,899
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

159
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:04,019
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

160
00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,700
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,580
So I think I'm getting better now.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,519
Great.

163
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,559
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

164
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,039
We are shortlisting our candidates this week.

165
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:31,419
And next week, we will inform our shortlisted candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

166
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,279
Great.

167
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:32,980
Thanks a lot.

168
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,519
I hope to hear from you.

169
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:34,879
Goodbye.

170
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,399
All right, Marco.

171
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,899
Well, this classic question, why should we hire you?

172
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,399
I think you'll hear it in many, many different interviews.

173
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,960
And how did he deal with it here?

174
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,840
Well, the first thing that he said is very, very important because they're asking you why.

175
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,919
So your immediate reaction would be to answer with because or I think that.

176
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,200
But there's a different way of approaching it, which is a little bit more professional.

177
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,500
He said, I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

178
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,940
I think I would be a perfect fit in this company.

179
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,519
That's how he started his answer.

180
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,039
And then he explained why.

181
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,539
So this sounds really strong, doesn't it?

182
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:25,840
Yeah, basically, it just makes you seem to be very confident and puts you like you are already part of the company.

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
So this is a great way to start off this question.

184
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,039
But you got to follow this up with some information.

185
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,080
So what kind of information should you be giving?

186
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,639
Well, like we talked about in your work experience, the same thing goes here.

187
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,679
What do you have to offer to this company?

188
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,399
What special skills or insights or experience can you bring that would help us?

189
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah, that nobody else can bring.

190
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:49,679
Exactly.

191
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:56,539
So again, you have to start talking about your strengths and your previous experience, but with examples, right?

192
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,360
Very, very specific examples.

193
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,240
And whenever you can throw in some numbers or some specific successes that you have had.

194
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,379
Exactly.

195
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:18,500
And once you've talked about these things, you can close off this answer by saying, given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

196
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,539
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

197
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:32,100
So that is just like a magical sentence saying like, if you give me the chance, I will demonstrate how good I am and how I can help this company.

198
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,200
Yes, a really, really strong closing argument.

199
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:36,860
Yes.

200
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,059
So that's the way you should more or less approach that question.

201
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:41,360
Right.

202
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:41,879
All right.

203
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,960
But let's turn now to the classic, classic question.

204
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,340
Your greatest weakness.

205
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,740
What is your greatest weakness?

206
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,899
When you get this question, be sure to not say my greatest weakness is I work too much.

207
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,580
My greatest weakness is I'm a workaholic.

208
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,200
Right.

209
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,620
Or what was it?

210
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,879
Oh, or I am a perfectionist.

211
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,019
Yeah.

212
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
These we can see right through these.

213
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,340
I mean, they're too obvious and they're too silly.

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,000
I mean, everyone has a weakness.

215
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,840
So don't try and turn it around into a strength.

216
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,200
I just don't think that's a good idea.

217
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:14,820
Okay.

218
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,100
So yeah, be sure to stay away from these answers.

219
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,960
But you can say anything like in this case, he has a problem with being on time.

220
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:23,460
Yeah.

221
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,679
So be honest, say what one of your greatest weaknesses are.

222
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:36,120
But the key to making this weakness look good is saying what you are doing to solve this weakness.

223
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:36,899
Exactly.

224
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,320
So, so really be truthful.

225
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,220
Tell, tell the interviewer what you're not good at.

226
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,120
Because, because you're, there's obviously something that you're not good at.

227
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:45,519
Exactly.

228
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,039
So you can say I am usually late, but I am getting more organized.

229
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,399
I'm doing the seminar.

230
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,500
I, you know, let the interviewer know that you are trying to improve this weakness.

231
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,120
Exactly.

232
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,340
And be sure to also think about your strength, right?

233
00:12:59,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Yeah.

234
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,279
Be prepared to answer the question, what is your greatest strength?

235
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,600
So, and again, when you're talking about your strengths, be sure it's something more specific than saying, oh, I'm very responsible.

236
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:12,200
Yeah.

237
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,539
You want to be as specific as you can.

238
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,019
And again, give those examples, give those, give those successes, give those numbers.

239
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:20,700
Right.

240
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:21,179
Exactly.

241
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,320
So think about your weaknesses.

242
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,500
Think about your strengths.

243
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,179
If you don't know them, ask people to ask your colleagues or ask your friends, what do you think is my greatest strength?

244
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:31,360
Maybe you're a funny person.

245
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,039
That's a strength.

246
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,480
Yes.

247
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,159
Okay.

248
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:40,360
