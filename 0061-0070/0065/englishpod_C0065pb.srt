00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And we're bringing you the final lesson of our job interview series.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And in this lesson, we're going to be focusing on two very, very common but sometimes difficult questions.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okay.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we've talked about preparing for the job interview in part one.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Part two, we talked about educational background and work experience.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And in part three, what are we going to be looking at?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're going to be looking at two questions, why we should hire you, and your greatest weakness.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So these are the classic common questions that you'll get at a job interview, right?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's right.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So why don't we just get started and we'll take a listen to the dialogue and see how our interviewee handles these questions.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Very good.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now, I have a couple of final questions.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I hope they're not too hard.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, why should we hire you?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know, I excel at building strong long-term consumer relationships.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team resolved about 70% of our customers' problems.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Impressive.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I'm getting better now.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Great.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short-listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Great, thanks a lot.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I hope to hear from you.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Goodbye.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, our interviewee is doing very well, but I think he had a little bit too many beans or chili.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh my god, this is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But he doesn't say anything, so I don't know.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe he should have said, oh pardon me, excuse me.

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know, it's a controversy.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yeah, okay, but what isn't a controversy is the language because there's some great stuff in here.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
All right, so let's take a look at the language in Language Takeaway.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Language Takeaway.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
All right, we've got some great phrases and words for you to use when you're talking about what sort of benefits and skills and experience and expertise you can bring to a company.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, the first thing that he said, and it's a very interesting word, he said technical acumen.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Technical acumen.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Acumen.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Acumen.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is a really hard word.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What is acumen?

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's basically insight and understanding and the ability to make good and difficult decisions.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okay, so he has a very strong technical acumen.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So a strong insight or understanding of technical issues.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Okay, or I can change it and maybe say, I have a very strong business acumen.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Exactly.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
These are the two most common ways that this word is used.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Technical acumen, business acumen.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, great.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now let's take a look at another word which is very interesting because everybody knows it.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Excel.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Excel.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Excel.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now Excel is of course the software that you use, right?

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, but here it's a verb meaning to be really, really good at something.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Right, to be the best maybe.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
To excel at something.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, so I excel at cooking.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right, so Excel, you are the best.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I mean that's not really gonna help me in a job interview, but the next word might.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Head.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Head.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well in the dialogue we heard it as headed in the past, right?

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, that's right.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He headed the customer support department.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I think this is a great word to use when you were saying I was the leader.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mm-hmm.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was the main person in charge.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yeah, the manager.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So this is a nice verb to use to show that you were leading something.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, now for the next word.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Struggle.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
To struggle.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Struggle.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Struggle.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So what does struggle mean?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It means that you have difficulty doing something.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So it's hard for you.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
For example, when I was in school I struggled with math.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, and now I struggle with Chinese.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Exactly, so to have a hard time.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, why don't we hear a couple of examples of how this word is used.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Example one.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We're really struggling to reach our sales target.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Example two.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yeah, to be honest, I do struggle with time management.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Example three.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The teacher farted in class and I really had to struggle not to laugh.

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, so great examples.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's move on to our next word.

110
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Punctuality.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Punctuality.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Punctuality.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Punctuality.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay, so to be punctual.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It means to be on time, always.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Always.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So punctuality would be noun form.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Right, so the condition or the state of always being on time.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Right, so punctuality.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
To be punctual.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, and our interviewee struggles with punctuality.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right, like me.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I guess you guys have something in common.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We do.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now, he has a problem with punctuality, but he said he has addressed this weakness.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes, to address.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Address.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Address.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Now, if you notice, it's spelled the same way as address.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But you pronounce it differently.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The verb address has the stress on the second syllable.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, address.

134
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, and that means to deal with the problem.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yeah, to acknowledge the problem and to try and solve it and to try and solve it.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, so different from your home address where you live.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yeah, and there the stress is on the first syllable.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Address.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Perfect.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Very good.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue one more time, and then we'll come back and talk about these two questions.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Greatest weakness and why should we hire you?

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Very good.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now, I have a couple of final questions.

146
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I hope they're not too hard.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, why should we hire you?

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen with outstanding soft skills.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You know, I excel at building strong, long-term consumer relationships.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:29,000
For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team resolved about 70% of our information and technical preparation on our products.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve 90% of our customers' issues.

153
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Impressive.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Punctuality has never been a strength of mine.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I find it hard to organize my time effectively.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've actually addressed this weakness recently by attending a workshop on efficient time management.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It helped me a lot by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So I think I'm getting better now.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Great.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We are shortlisting our candidates this week.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And next week, we will inform our shortlisted candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Great.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thanks a lot.

168
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I hope to hear from you.

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Goodbye.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All right, Marco.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, this classic question, why should we hire you?

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think you'll hear it in many, many different interviews.

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And how did he deal with it here?

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Well, the first thing that he said is very, very important because they're asking you why.

175
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So your immediate reaction would be to answer with because or I think that.

176
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But there's a different way of approaching it, which is a little bit more professional.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He said, I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I think I would be a perfect fit in this company.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's how he started his answer.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then he explained why.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So this sounds really strong, doesn't it?

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, basically, it just makes you seem to be very confident and puts you like you are already part of the company.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So this is a great way to start off this question.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But you got to follow this up with some information.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So what kind of information should you be giving?

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, like we talked about in your work experience, the same thing goes here.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What do you have to offer to this company?

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What special skills or insights or experience can you bring that would help us?

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah, that nobody else can bring.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Exactly.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So again, you have to start talking about your strengths and your previous experience, but with examples, right?

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Very, very specific examples.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And whenever you can throw in some numbers or some specific successes that you have had.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Exactly.

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And once you've talked about these things, you can close off this answer by saying, given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.

197
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So that is just like a magical sentence saying like, if you give me the chance, I will demonstrate how good I am and how I can help this company.

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes, a really, really strong closing argument.

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

200
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So that's the way you should more or less approach that question.

201
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Right.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All right.

203
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But let's turn now to the classic, classic question.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Your greatest weakness.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What is your greatest weakness?

206
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When you get this question, be sure to not say my greatest weakness is I work too much.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My greatest weakness is I'm a workaholic.

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right.

209
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Or what was it?

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, or I am a perfectionist.

211
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah.

212
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
These we can see right through these.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean, they're too obvious and they're too silly.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I mean, everyone has a weakness.

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So don't try and turn it around into a strength.

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I just don't think that's a good idea.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay.

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So yeah, be sure to stay away from these answers.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But you can say anything like in this case, he has a problem with being on time.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So be honest, say what one of your greatest weaknesses are.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But the key to making this weakness look good is saying what you are doing to solve this weakness.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Exactly.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So, so really be truthful.

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Tell, tell the interviewer what you're not good at.

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Because, because you're, there's obviously something that you're not good at.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Exactly.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So you can say I am usually late, but I am getting more organized.

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm doing the seminar.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I, you know, let the interviewer know that you are trying to improve this weakness.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Exactly.

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And be sure to also think about your strength, right?

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Be prepared to answer the question, what is your greatest strength?

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So, and again, when you're talking about your strengths, be sure it's something more specific than saying, oh, I'm very responsible.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You want to be as specific as you can.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And again, give those examples, give those, give those successes, give those numbers.

239
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Right.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Exactly.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So think about your weaknesses.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Think about your strengths.

243
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you don't know them, ask people to ask your colleagues or ask your friends, what do you think is my greatest strength?

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Maybe you're a funny person.

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's a strength.

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

247
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
