00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:06,099
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:06,860
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,860
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,759
And today we have a fun dialogue.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:11,660
That's right.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:21,260
Well, maybe the language in this lesson you won't use every day, but it's fun, it's interesting, and it's a little bit on the lighter side.

7
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,100
That's right.

8
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:28,859
Today we're going to be looking at baby talk, so we're going to see some of these words that aren't really words.

9
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:36,079
They're not real words that you can find in the dictionary, but native English speakers use them when they're talking to little babies.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,659
Yeah, in many languages there's a rule for how you make baby talk words, right?

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,259
Right.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:49,880
But in English we don't have really clear rules about how you make a word a baby word, so we're going to teach you a few of these baby words.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,659
Exactly.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,659
So before we listen to the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,159
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,219
Okay, we have two words here we're going to hear in the dialogue, and the first one is diaper.

17
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,299
Diaper.

18
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:08,959
Diaper.

19
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:12,340
Okay, so a diaper, a baby uses a diaper.

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,159
That's right.

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:20,819
It's a piece of cloth or material that you put around the baby so that it can go to the bathroom and not make a mess.

22
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,379
Okay, a diaper.

23
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,560
Now we also have another word that we commonly use in the English language.

24
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,159
It's nana.

25
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:29,900
Nana.

26
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,019
Nana.

27
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,819
So nana is the name we call a grandmother.

28
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,840
Right, so an informal name.

29
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,099
Just like in Spanish we would say something like abue or abuelita.

30
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,340
Or in Italian you might say oma.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,780
This is another way that we can call grandma or granny.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,359
Nana.

33
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,140
Okay, so nana.

34
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,120
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time.

35
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:59,040
Let's see how these new parents are talking to their little baby using baby talk.

36
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,120
Honey, the baby's up again.

37
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:11,800
It's your turn.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,259
I went last night.

39
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,460
Fine.

40
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,039
Hello, little baby.

41
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,680
Why are you crying, little baby?

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh, I see.

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,879
You made a doo-doo.

44
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:29,099
What's going on, hun?

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,199
Why is the baby crying?

46
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,819
The little baby made a doo-doo.

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,180
What a good boy.

48
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,879
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

49
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:40,659
Look at what I have here.

50
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,500
Mickey Mouse jammies.

51
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,319
Whoopsie daisy.

52
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:47,360
Did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

53
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:48,730
Yes, he did.

54
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,300
Yes, he did.

55
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,060
You just made a wee-wee all over daddy.

56
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:56,259
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

57
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,500
What's going on in here?

58
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:01,699
Oh, look.

59
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:02,300
It's Nana.

60
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,780
Say hi to Nana.

61
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,819
Oh, he's so adorable.

62
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,340
I could just eat him up.

63
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,740
Okay, say bye to Nana.

64
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,819
Time to go beddy-bye.

65
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,620
Okay, well, that was pretty cute, wasn't it?

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,800
A cute dialogue.

67
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,520
The baby seemed to be cute.

68
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,819
And, well, everyone's excited about the new baby.

69
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,639
But they used some really interesting little words that are pretty unfamiliar.

70
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,479
So let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,439
Alright, so as we mentioned before, these words aren't actually words.

72
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,379
You won't find them in the dictionary.

73
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:52,180
Right, but you'll hear them commonly when people are talking to babies and you might see them in a movie or something like that.

74
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:54,759
So why don't we get started with the first one.

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,240
Alright, the first word that may seem a little bit strange.

76
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,639
The father said, Hello, whittle baby.

77
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,860
Whittle baby.

78
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,319
Okay, whittle.

79
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,580
So whittle is just a baby talk way of saying little.

80
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:10,340
Little, that's right.

81
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,019
Now the father saw that the baby was crying because he made a doo-doo.

82
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,720
The baby made the doo-doo, not the father.

83
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,980
Right, the baby made a doo-doo.

84
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,300
A doo-doo.

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,620
Okay, so basically a doo-doo is when the baby poos or poops in the diaper.

86
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,540
Okay, so sometimes you go to the bathroom and it might take a little bit longer.

87
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:32,300
Exactly.

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,560
That's because of the doo-doo.

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,139
The doo-doo.

90
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,860
Alright, the actual technical or maybe the proper English word for this would be defecate.

91
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,399
Okay, so make a doo-doo.

92
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,019
Alright, now our third words are interesting because he said icky diaper.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,600
That's right, an icky diaper.

94
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,959
And then he also said yucky.

95
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,660
So we've got two words here that mean the same thing.

96
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,319
Icky and yucky.

97
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,639
And basically means disgusting.

98
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,439
Right, something that's really, really not nice.

99
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,480
So you would say icky or yucky.

100
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,339
Now these words have other similar words.

101
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,439
We might recognize ick or yuck.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,839
Right, so you would use ick or yuck if something is disgusting.

103
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,639
But when you're kind of talking to a baby, you would say icky, yucky, smelly.

104
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,279
Yes, the adjective.

105
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,459
Now our next word, the father said he has some Mickey Mouse jammies.

106
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:28,819
Jammies?

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,579
Jammies.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,160
Okay, so what are jammies?

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,519
Well, the word jammies is short for pajamas.

110
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,939
Okay, pajamas.

111
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,699
So the clothes that you put on when you go to sleep.

112
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:39,879
Jammies.

113
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,000
Jammies.

114
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,120
Alright, and now for our last two words, they mean the same thing as well.

115
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,740
The little baby tinkled all over daddy.

116
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,519
So to tinkle.

117
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,079
And then his mom said a wee-wee all over daddy.

118
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,500
You made a wee-wee.

119
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,980
Okay, so tinkle and wee-wee.

120
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:02,660
Basically also going to the bathroom, but this time to pee.

121
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,879
To pee, exactly.

122
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,240
To urinate.

123
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,279
Wee-wee.

124
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,699
So the verb to tinkle and the noun a wee-wee.

125
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:11,279
Very good.

126
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:14,279
So these are the words that we have for you today in language.

127
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:21,100
Take away, as you can see, they're kind of cute and very common when you're talking to babies and you have to be a little bit nicer.

128
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:29,339
Alright, so why don't we listen to the dialogue another time, a little bit slower, and you'll catch these words a little bit easier.

129
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,279
Honey, the baby's up again.

130
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,980
It's your turn.

131
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:40,420
I went last night.

132
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,600
Fine.

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,279
Hello, little baby.

134
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,120
Why are you crying, little baby?

135
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh, I see.

136
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,019
You made a doo-doo.

137
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,319
What's going on, hun?

138
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,399
Why is the baby crying?

139
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,040
The little baby made a doo-doo.

140
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,399
What a good boy.

141
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,100
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

142
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,879
Look at what I have here.

143
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:08,720
Mickey Mouse jammies.

144
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:10,480
Oopsie-daisy.

145
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,560
Did the little baby just tinkle all over Daddy?

146
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,180
Yes, he did.

147
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,500
Yes, he did.

148
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,259
You just made a wee-wee all over Daddy.

149
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:22,459
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

150
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,720
Oh, what's going on in here?

151
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,500
Oh, look, it's Nana.

152
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
Say hi to Nana.

153
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,579
Oh, he's so adorable.

154
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,500
I could just eat him up.

155
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,939
Okay, say bye to Nana.

156
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:42,079
Time to go beddy-bye.

157
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:57,060
All right, so now that we've seen those great words, let's take a look at two phrases that we're going to look at now in Fluency Builder.

158
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,339
Fluency Builder.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,720
So the mother didn't really want to get up and look after the baby.

160
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,180
She said, it's your turn.

161
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,480
It's your turn.

162
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,319
It's your turn.

163
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,139
So when she says, it's your turn.

164
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:13,220
That means you should do it now.

165
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,959
Right, so she's basically saying, now you have to do it.

166
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,980
I did it last time, so now you have to do it.

167
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,399
It's your turn.

168
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,040
That's right, it's your turn.

169
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:31,800
And, well, the Nana, the grandmother, she was really, of course she really loves this little baby, and she said, I could just eat him up.

170
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,419
I could just eat him up.

171
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,500
I could just eat him up.

172
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:38,600
Now, does she want to really eat him?

173
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,059
No, of course, of course not.

174
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,159
So what does she mean by this?

175
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,639
This is a phrase we often use with very cute things.

176
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,539
It just means, oh my God, he's so cute.

177
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,580
Okay, he's so cute that I wish I could just hug him and kiss him a lot.

178
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,620
Yes, we might use this with babies or maybe with puppies.

179
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,240
I could just eat him up.

180
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,000
All right, so great two phrases that we've just taken a look at.

181
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,060
Let's go back to our dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about these babies.

182
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,980
Honey, the baby's up again.

183
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,679
It's your turn.

184
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,139
I went last night.

185
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,320
Fine.

186
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:30,940
Hello, little baby.

187
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,759
Why are you crying, little baby?

188
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,379
Oh, I see.

189
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,659
You made a doo-doo.

190
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,980
What's going on, hun?

191
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,019
Why is the baby crying?

192
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,580
The little baby made a doo-doo.

193
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,059
What a good boy.

194
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,759
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

195
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,519
Look at what I have here.

196
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,360
Mickey Mouse jammies.

197
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,139
Oopsie daisy.

198
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:58,220
Did the little baby just tinkle all over Daddy?

199
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,759
Yes, he did.

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,179
Yes, he did.

201
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,940
You just made a wee-wee all over Daddy.

202
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,139
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

203
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,399
What's going on in here?

204
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,139
Oh, look, it's Nana.

205
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:14,639
Say hi to Nana.

206
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,659
Oh, he's so adorable.

207
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:21,259
I could just eat him up.

208
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,639
Okay, say bye to Nana.

209
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,720
Time to go beddy-bye.

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,460
Bye.

211
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,299
Okay, so they are obviously new parents.

212
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:40,240
They've just had a baby, so they're excited about him waking up.

213
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,360
They're all excited about the baby and how he wakes up and everything.

214
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,919
But an interesting thing, the baby was sleeping in another room.

215
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:56,860
In English-speaking countries, people have sort of two different opinions about how you should sleep with your baby.

216
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,039
Some people want to have the baby in the bed with them, right?

217
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,440
But some people think, no, the baby should definitely sleep in its own room.

218
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,299
Okay, in another room in a crib.

219
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:06,799
Yeah.

220
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:17,779
Right, I think this is a very important issue because many people consider that it's a good thing for the baby to sleep with the parents and it feels safe and you can make sure the baby's okay.

221
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:22,620
And it's easier for waking up to feed the baby and change his diaper.

222
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,580
Exactly, and well, if the baby is sleeping with its parents, it might not wake up as much.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,159
But other people think if you let the baby sleep with the parents, the baby will become kind of spoiled and not a very good baby.

224
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Right, it might become too dependent on the parents.

225
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:49,399
And for example, if you ever want to go out or leave the baby with a babysitter or when the baby starts maybe preschool or kindergarten, it might not be really independent.

226
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,080
So why don't you tell us what you think?

227
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,740
Do you think it's a good idea to allow a baby to sleep with you or should it sleep in its own room?

228
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,080
Yeah, you can tell us at our website EnglishPod.com where you can also ask any questions you have about the language in this dialogue.

229
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,179
Alright guys, so we'll see you there and until next time.

230
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,100
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.
