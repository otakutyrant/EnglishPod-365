00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another podcast here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we have a fun dialogue.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, maybe the language in this lesson you won't use every day, but it's fun, it's interesting, and it's a little bit on the lighter side.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today we're going to be looking at baby talk, so we're going to see some of these words that aren't really words.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They're not real words that you can find in the dictionary, but native English speakers use them when they're talking to little babies.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yeah, in many languages there's a rule for how you make baby talk words, right?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Right.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But in English we don't have really clear rules about how you make a word a baby word, so we're going to teach you a few of these baby words.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Exactly.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So before we listen to the dialogue, why don't we take a look at vocabulary preview.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Vocabulary preview.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, we have two words here we're going to hear in the dialogue, and the first one is diaper.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Diaper.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Diaper.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, so a diaper, a baby uses a diaper.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's right.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a piece of cloth or material that you put around the baby so that it can go to the bathroom and not make a mess.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, a diaper.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Now we also have another word that we commonly use in the English language.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's nana.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Nana.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Nana.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So nana is the name we call a grandmother.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Right, so an informal name.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Just like in Spanish we would say something like abue or abuelita.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or in Italian you might say oma.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is another way that we can call grandma or granny.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Nana.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, so nana.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the first time.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's see how these new parents are talking to their little baby using baby talk.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Honey, the baby's up again.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's your turn.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I went last night.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Fine.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello, little baby.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are you crying, little baby?

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, I see.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You made a doo-doo.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's going on, hun?

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why is the baby crying?

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The little baby made a doo-doo.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What a good boy.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Look at what I have here.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Mickey Mouse jammies.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Whoopsie daisy.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did the little baby just tinkle all over daddy?

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, he did.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, he did.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You just made a wee-wee all over daddy.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's going on in here?

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, look.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's Nana.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Say hi to Nana.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, he's so adorable.

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I could just eat him up.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, say bye to Nana.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Time to go beddy-bye.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay, well, that was pretty cute, wasn't it?

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A cute dialogue.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The baby seemed to be cute.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And, well, everyone's excited about the new baby.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But they used some really interesting little words that are pretty unfamiliar.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, so as we mentioned before, these words aren't actually words.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You won't find them in the dictionary.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Right, but you'll hear them commonly when people are talking to babies and you might see them in a movie or something like that.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So why don't we get started with the first one.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Alright, the first word that may seem a little bit strange.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The father said, Hello, whittle baby.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Whittle baby.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Okay, whittle.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So whittle is just a baby talk way of saying little.

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Little, that's right.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now the father saw that the baby was crying because he made a doo-doo.

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The baby made the doo-doo, not the father.

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Right, the baby made a doo-doo.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A doo-doo.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, so basically a doo-doo is when the baby poos or poops in the diaper.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay, so sometimes you go to the bathroom and it might take a little bit longer.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Exactly.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's because of the doo-doo.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The doo-doo.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Alright, the actual technical or maybe the proper English word for this would be defecate.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, so make a doo-doo.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright, now our third words are interesting because he said icky diaper.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right, an icky diaper.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And then he also said yucky.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So we've got two words here that mean the same thing.

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Icky and yucky.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And basically means disgusting.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right, something that's really, really not nice.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So you would say icky or yucky.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now these words have other similar words.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We might recognize ick or yuck.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Right, so you would use ick or yuck if something is disgusting.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But when you're kind of talking to a baby, you would say icky, yucky, smelly.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, the adjective.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now our next word, the father said he has some Mickey Mouse jammies.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Jammies?

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jammies.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, so what are jammies?

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, the word jammies is short for pajamas.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, pajamas.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So the clothes that you put on when you go to sleep.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Jammies.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Jammies.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright, and now for our last two words, they mean the same thing as well.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The little baby tinkled all over daddy.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So to tinkle.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And then his mom said a wee-wee all over daddy.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You made a wee-wee.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, so tinkle and wee-wee.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Basically also going to the bathroom, but this time to pee.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
To pee, exactly.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To urinate.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wee-wee.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So the verb to tinkle and the noun a wee-wee.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Very good.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So these are the words that we have for you today in language.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Take away, as you can see, they're kind of cute and very common when you're talking to babies and you have to be a little bit nicer.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Alright, so why don't we listen to the dialogue another time, a little bit slower, and you'll catch these words a little bit easier.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Honey, the baby's up again.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's your turn.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I went last night.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Fine.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hello, little baby.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why are you crying, little baby?

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, I see.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You made a doo-doo.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's going on, hun?

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why is the baby crying?

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The little baby made a doo-doo.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What a good boy.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Look at what I have here.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Mickey Mouse jammies.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oopsie-daisy.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Did the little baby just tinkle all over Daddy?

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes, he did.

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes, he did.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You just made a wee-wee all over Daddy.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, what's going on in here?

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, look, it's Nana.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Say hi to Nana.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, he's so adorable.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I could just eat him up.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, say bye to Nana.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Time to go beddy-bye.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
All right, so now that we've seen those great words, let's take a look at two phrases that we're going to look at now in Fluency Builder.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Fluency Builder.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So the mother didn't really want to get up and look after the baby.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
She said, it's your turn.

161
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's your turn.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's your turn.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So when she says, it's your turn.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That means you should do it now.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right, so she's basically saying, now you have to do it.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I did it last time, so now you have to do it.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's your turn.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right, it's your turn.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And, well, the Nana, the grandmother, she was really, of course she really loves this little baby, and she said, I could just eat him up.

170
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I could just eat him up.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I could just eat him up.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now, does she want to really eat him?

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No, of course, of course not.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So what does she mean by this?

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is a phrase we often use with very cute things.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It just means, oh my God, he's so cute.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Okay, he's so cute that I wish I could just hug him and kiss him a lot.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes, we might use this with babies or maybe with puppies.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I could just eat him up.

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
All right, so great two phrases that we've just taken a look at.

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's go back to our dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about these babies.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Honey, the baby's up again.

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's your turn.

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I went last night.

185
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Fine.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hello, little baby.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why are you crying, little baby?

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh, I see.

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You made a doo-doo.

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What's going on, hun?

191
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why is the baby crying?

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The little baby made a doo-doo.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What a good boy.

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's get this icky diaper off you.

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Look at what I have here.

196
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mickey Mouse jammies.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oopsie daisy.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Did the little baby just tinkle all over Daddy?

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, he did.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, he did.

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You just made a wee-wee all over Daddy.

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Hold still while I change this yucky diaper.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's going on in here?

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, look, it's Nana.

205
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Say hi to Nana.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, he's so adorable.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I could just eat him up.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay, say bye to Nana.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Time to go beddy-bye.

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Bye.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, so they are obviously new parents.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They've just had a baby, so they're excited about him waking up.

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They're all excited about the baby and how he wakes up and everything.

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
But an interesting thing, the baby was sleeping in another room.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
In English-speaking countries, people have sort of two different opinions about how you should sleep with your baby.

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Some people want to have the baby in the bed with them, right?

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But some people think, no, the baby should definitely sleep in its own room.

218
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, in another room in a crib.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Yeah.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Right, I think this is a very important issue because many people consider that it's a good thing for the baby to sleep with the parents and it feels safe and you can make sure the baby's okay.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And it's easier for waking up to feed the baby and change his diaper.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Exactly, and well, if the baby is sleeping with its parents, it might not wake up as much.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But other people think if you let the baby sleep with the parents, the baby will become kind of spoiled and not a very good baby.

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right, it might become too dependent on the parents.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And for example, if you ever want to go out or leave the baby with a babysitter or when the baby starts maybe preschool or kindergarten, it might not be really independent.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
So why don't you tell us what you think?

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you think it's a good idea to allow a baby to sleep with you or should it sleep in its own room?

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yeah, you can tell us at our website EnglishPod.com where you can also ask any questions you have about the language in this dialogue.

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Alright guys, so we'll see you there and until next time.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.
