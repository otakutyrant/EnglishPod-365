00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:14,000
EnglishPod.com Are you okay, man?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You don't look very well.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I feel terrible.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Nice.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So where did you guys go?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh no!

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Tell me about it.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We drank everything in the bar.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that why you missed work today?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I threw up like five times.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Ew!

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I swear, I am never going to drink again.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Too bad, man.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh yeah?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm there.
