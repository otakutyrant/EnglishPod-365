00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:14,980
EnglishPod.com Are you okay, man?

2
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,519
You don't look very well.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,660
I feel terrible.

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,879
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:23,579
Nice.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,920
So where did you guys go?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,760
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,440
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,619
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,579
Oh no!

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,340
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,799
Tell me about it.

13
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,679
We drank everything in the bar.

14
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,479
Is that why you missed work today?

15
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,359
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,659
I threw up like five times.

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,299
Ew!

18
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:54,979
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

19
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:58,619
I swear, I am never going to drink again.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,899
Too bad, man.

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,939
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

22
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:03,359
Oh yeah?

23
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:04,060
I'm there.
