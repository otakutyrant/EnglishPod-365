00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another lesson with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
And today we don't feel very good.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Actually, in this lesson we're talking about a hangover.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A hangover.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Wow, that's an interesting word.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What does that mean?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, when you drink beer or wine or vodka and you drink too much of it, the next morning you have a hangover.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Okay, so a lot of our listeners have probably experienced the hangover before.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's very likely.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But the problem is when you have to go to work the next day.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, and you might need to actually miss work, but you need some good words and phrases to describe how bad you feel.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We have a guy describing his hangover and why he missed work that day.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you okay, man?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You don't look very well.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I feel terrible.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Nice.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So where did you guys go?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, no.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Tell me about it.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We drank everything in the bar.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is that why you missed work today?

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I threw up like five times.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I swear I am never going to drink again.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Too bad, man.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, yeah?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm there.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
All right, so he's never drinking again, but then at the next chance for a party, he's already ready to go.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I think that's the typical lie of every person that drinks.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They say, I'll never drink again, but a week later or a month later, they are again.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Or a day later.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All right, so we saw some great vocab here.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So let's look at it now in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're going to look at five words here.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now, the first one, they talked about how Mike's birthday is a drink fest.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A drink fest.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a drink fest.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
All right, so we have this word drink fest.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now, what is this fest part?

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, maybe you recognize the word Oktoberfest.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, or festival.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So fest is like a party.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There's lots of food.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's lots of drink.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A drink fest is an event where there's a lot of drinks.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, so can I have different types of fests?

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, this is a really informal sort of slang way of saying there's lots of something.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I could say, oh my god, it's a puppy fest.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So there are a lot of puppies.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or I can say like a fast food fest.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, so you're eating a lot of fast food.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There's a lot of fast food.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
All right, so fest, interesting.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now, when he was describing his hangover, he said that he felt really nauseous.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nauseous?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Nauseous.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, I always have a hard time spelling this word.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So n-a-u-s-e-o-u-s.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Nauseous.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Nauseous.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It kind of seems like you should say nauseous.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Right.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But you say nauseous.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Okay, so when you're feeling nauseous, what do you feel like?

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So you feel dizzy.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You don't feel very well.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Like your stomach hurts.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, and your head is kind of spinning.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, and you feel like you might throw up.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Right, exactly.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now, this word that you just mentioned, throw up, is actually our next word.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And well, we're not going to describe it.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why don't we just listen to a person throwing up?

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, Marco, that was horrible.

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well, that's the only way we could actually explain throw up.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I mean, it's kind of a hard word to explain.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But I'm sure everyone understands now what it means, right?

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The word is to throw up.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To throw up.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To throw up.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Our next word.

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now, our guy who's hung over, he said, I was so dehydrated.

97
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Dehydrated.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To be dehydrated.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So this is an adjective, and it means that I have no water in my body.

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Exactly.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, so I am dehydrated.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I need water.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, common feeling after drinking too much beer, huh?

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now, our final word, he said he had a headache.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And he said, my head's been pounding all day.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, so his head has been pounding all day.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Now, this verb, pounding, it sounds like this.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Alright, so a clear example of what your head feels like when you have this very bad headache.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can also say, I have a pounding headache.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have a pounding headache, exactly.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where my head is pounding.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Alright, so five great words that we just looked at right now.

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So why don't we listen to our dialogue a second time.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's slow it down just a little bit.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you okay, man?

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You don't look very well.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I feel terrible.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Nice.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So where did you guys go?

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, no.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Tell me about it.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We drank everything in the bar.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is that why you missed work today?

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I threw up like five times.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I swear, I am never going to drink again.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Too bad, man.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, yeah?

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm there.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,000
All right.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, that was a little easier to understand this time.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Now you mentioned that we've got some great phrases.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So let's go to them now in Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fluency Builder.

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
All right.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So as we heard in the dialogue, the party was, I think it was a great party, right?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, it sounds like it was fantastic.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Well, apparently it was a great party and he said that he went out with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Things got a little out of hand.

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Right.

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Things got a little out of hand.

150
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now to get out of hand, what's that mean?

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, we have some examples, so let's listen to a couple of them before we explain it.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Example one.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Honey, the kids are getting a little out of hand.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Can you do something?

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Example two.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Guys, this argument is getting out of hand.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's all calm down.

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Example three.

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The party last night got out of hand.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The neighbors called the police.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So when things get out of hand, you lose control.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Exactly.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They get out of control just a little bit, maybe.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go a little crazy.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All right.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So things got a little out of hand.

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Now the opposite of this was everything was cool.

169
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Everything was cool.

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So everything was cool.

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So basically everything was okay.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Everything was relaxed.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Everything was going fine.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And then Mike came along and then things got a little out of hand.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, that Mike.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And now for our last phrase, he was describing that Mike's birthday party was a drink fest, right?

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And then his friend agreed.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He said, tell me about it.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Tell me about it.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Tell me about it.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now, what does this mean exactly when he says tell me about it?

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Basically, it means I completely understand.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I completely agree with you.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay.

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So I could say, Oh my God, Marco, it's so hot outside today.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Right.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I would say, Oh, I know.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tell me about it.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Right.

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I'm saying, yeah, I agree with you.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You are right.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yep.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Very good.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So these phrases.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

197
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So three great phrases that we just looked at.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you okay, man?

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You don't look very well.

202
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I feel terrible.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Nice.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So where did you guys go?

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

208
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh no.

210
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

211
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And tell me about it.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We drank everything in the bar.

213
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is that why you missed work today?

214
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I threw up like five times.

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Ew.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I swear I am never going to drink again.

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Too bad, man.

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

222
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh yeah?

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm there.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So it sounds like these guys sure like to go out and have a few drinks, don't they?

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, exactly.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And I think this is a very common thing among young people, usually in the United States.

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
After a day at the office or something, they'll go.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Or even in Europe, they'll go to the pub, right?

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But the thing is that in America and Canada, we're very careful about alcohol and young people, right?

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, exactly.

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The legal drinking age in the most part of the United States is 21 years of age.

233
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And really many parents or families will never let their children drink alcohol until they're 21.

234
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Right.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And also the laws that control alcohol, like for example, on television, if you notice a TV commercial with a beer or a wine, you will never see the person actually drinking it.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's illegal.

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yeah, that's true.

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
While in other countries, it's okay.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You'll see people drinking and having fun.

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
In these commercials, they can only maybe put them close to their lips, but not drink it.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Interesting.

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean, another weird thing is that, you know, sometimes you might want to sit in your back garden or out on your porch and have a beer after work, right?

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But in places, it's totally illegal to do that.

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't be outside with alcohol, right?

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can't be seen drinking or you can't be on the sidewalk or on a bus drinking.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
While in other places, you can, right?

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can just have a beer on the subway.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So it's a little bit different policies on alcohol control.

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What do you guys think about it?

250
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you think it's correct?

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Or do you think maybe it's a little bit too exaggerated?

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,000
All right.

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We'll see you guys there.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And until next time.

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.
