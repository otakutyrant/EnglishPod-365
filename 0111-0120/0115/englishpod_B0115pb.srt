00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:06,740
Welcome back to another lesson with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,559
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:08,619
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,820
And today we don't feel very good.

6
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:11,880
That's right.

7
00:00:12,339 --> 00:00:16,460
Actually, in this lesson we're talking about a hangover.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,660
A hangover.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,339
Wow, that's an interesting word.

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,239
What does that mean?

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,679
Well, when you drink beer or wine or vodka and you drink too much of it, the next morning you have a hangover.

12
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:33,340
Okay, so a lot of our listeners have probably experienced the hangover before.

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,000
It's very likely.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,799
But the problem is when you have to go to work the next day.

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:48,340
Yes, and you might need to actually miss work, but you need some good words and phrases to describe how bad you feel.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay, so let's listen to this dialogue for the first time.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,640
We have a guy describing his hangover and why he missed work that day.

18
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,159
Are you okay, man?

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,780
You don't look very well.

20
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:18,819
I feel terrible.

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,079
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

22
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:23,760
Nice.

23
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,099
So where did you guys go?

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,959
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

25
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,620
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

26
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,799
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

27
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:35,760
Oh, no.

28
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,560
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

29
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,200
Tell me about it.

30
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:41,879
We drank everything in the bar.

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,640
Is that why you missed work today?

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,340
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

33
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:48,879
I threw up like five times.

34
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:55,159
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,799
I swear I am never going to drink again.

36
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,019
Too bad, man.

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,540
Oh, yeah?

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,299
I'm there.

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,719
All right, so he's never drinking again, but then at the next chance for a party, he's already ready to go.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,840
I think that's the typical lie of every person that drinks.

42
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:25,340
They say, I'll never drink again, but a week later or a month later, they are again.

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,159
Or a day later.

44
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,419
All right, so we saw some great vocab here.

45
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,500
So let's look at it now in Language Takeaway.

46
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,560
Language Takeaway.

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,120
We're going to look at five words here.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Now, the first one, they talked about how Mike's birthday is a drink fest.

49
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,139
A drink fest.

50
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,719
It's a drink fest.

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,960
All right, so we have this word drink fest.

52
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,180
Now, what is this fest part?

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, maybe you recognize the word Oktoberfest.

54
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,560
Okay, or festival.

55
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,180
So fest is like a party.

56
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,180
There's lots of food.

57
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,080
There's lots of drink.

58
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,699
A drink fest is an event where there's a lot of drinks.

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,520
Okay, so can I have different types of fests?

60
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:18,919
Yeah, this is a really informal sort of slang way of saying there's lots of something.

61
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:21,759
So I could say, oh my god, it's a puppy fest.

62
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,659
So there are a lot of puppies.

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,280
Or I can say like a fast food fest.

64
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,439
Okay, so you're eating a lot of fast food.

65
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,520
There's a lot of fast food.

66
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,599
All right, so fest, interesting.

67
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,060
Now, when he was describing his hangover, he said that he felt really nauseous.

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,120
Nauseous?

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,520
Nauseous.

70
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:43,199
Now, I always have a hard time spelling this word.

71
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,560
So n-a-u-s-e-o-u-s.

72
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,439
Nauseous.

73
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,340
Nauseous.

74
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,280
It kind of seems like you should say nauseous.

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:51,939
Right.

76
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,180
But you say nauseous.

77
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,419
Yeah.

78
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,759
Okay, so when you're feeling nauseous, what do you feel like?

79
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,539
So you feel dizzy.

80
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:00,620
You don't feel very well.

81
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,900
Like your stomach hurts.

82
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,439
Yeah, and your head is kind of spinning.

83
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,939
Okay, and you feel like you might throw up.

84
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:08,099
Right, exactly.

85
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:13,080
Now, this word that you just mentioned, throw up, is actually our next word.

86
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,080
And well, we're not going to describe it.

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
Why don't we just listen to a person throwing up?

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,100
Oh, Marco, that was horrible.

89
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,680
Well, that's the only way we could actually explain throw up.

90
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,480
I mean, it's kind of a hard word to explain.

91
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,379
But I'm sure everyone understands now what it means, right?

92
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,540
The word is to throw up.

93
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:38,300
To throw up.

94
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,980
To throw up.

95
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,839
Our next word.

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,540
Now, our guy who's hung over, he said, I was so dehydrated.

97
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,180
Dehydrated.

98
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,800
To be dehydrated.

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,079
So this is an adjective, and it means that I have no water in my body.

100
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:52,699
Exactly.

101
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:55,480
Okay, so I am dehydrated.

102
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,240
I need water.

103
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,560
Yeah, common feeling after drinking too much beer, huh?

104
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,740
Now, our final word, he said he had a headache.

105
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,560
And he said, my head's been pounding all day.

106
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay, so his head has been pounding all day.

107
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,500
Now, this verb, pounding, it sounds like this.

108
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,660
Alright, so a clear example of what your head feels like when you have this very bad headache.

109
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,939
You can also say, I have a pounding headache.

110
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,980
I have a pounding headache, exactly.

111
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,639
Where my head is pounding.

112
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,720
Alright, so five great words that we just looked at right now.

113
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,100
So why don't we listen to our dialogue a second time.

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's slow it down just a little bit.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,000
And then we'll come back and take a look at some phrases.

116
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you okay, man?

117
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,019
You don't look very well.

118
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,220
I feel terrible.

119
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,439
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

120
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,180
Nice.

121
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,480
So where did you guys go?

122
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,360
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

123
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,019
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,199
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

125
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,180
Oh, no.

126
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,000
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,279
Tell me about it.

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,279
We drank everything in the bar.

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,060
Is that why you missed work today?

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,920
Yeah, I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

131
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,240
I threw up like five times.

132
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,560
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

133
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,180
I swear, I am never going to drink again.

134
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,399
Too bad, man.

135
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,540
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

136
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:40,959
Oh, yeah?

137
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,639
I'm there.

138
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,779
All right.

139
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,160
Well, that was a little easier to understand this time.

140
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,079
Now you mentioned that we've got some great phrases.

141
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,139
So let's go to them now in Fluency Builder.

142
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,259
Fluency Builder.

143
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,319
All right.

144
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:01,779
So as we heard in the dialogue, the party was, I think it was a great party, right?

145
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,680
Well, it sounds like it was fantastic.

146
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:12,620
Well, apparently it was a great party and he said that he went out with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

147
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,379
Things got a little out of hand.

148
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:15,920
Right.

149
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,860
Things got a little out of hand.

150
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,759
Now to get out of hand, what's that mean?

151
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,720
Well, we have some examples, so let's listen to a couple of them before we explain it.

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
Example one.

153
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,420
Honey, the kids are getting a little out of hand.

154
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,339
Can you do something?

155
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,879
Example two.

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,139
Guys, this argument is getting out of hand.

157
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,420
Let's all calm down.

158
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,540
Example three.

159
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,519
The party last night got out of hand.

160
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:50,860
The neighbors called the police.

161
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,120
Okay.

162
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,139
So when things get out of hand, you lose control.

163
00:07:58,899 --> 00:07:58,980
Exactly.

164
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,300
They get out of control just a little bit, maybe.

165
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,579
Go a little crazy.

166
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,040
All right.

167
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,959
So things got a little out of hand.

168
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:10,779
Now the opposite of this was everything was cool.

169
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,279
Everything was cool.

170
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,540
So everything was cool.

171
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,740
So basically everything was okay.

172
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,360
Everything was relaxed.

173
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:19,720
Everything was going fine.

174
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,579
And then Mike came along and then things got a little out of hand.

175
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,439
Oh, that Mike.

176
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,139
And now for our last phrase, he was describing that Mike's birthday party was a drink fest, right?

177
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,059
And then his friend agreed.

178
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,059
He said, tell me about it.

179
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:37,220
Tell me about it.

180
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,159
Tell me about it.

181
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:41,899
Now, what does this mean exactly when he says tell me about it?

182
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,919
Basically, it means I completely understand.

183
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,720
I completely agree with you.

184
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,000
Yeah.

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,120
Okay.

186
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,700
So I could say, Oh my God, Marco, it's so hot outside today.

187
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,100
Right.

188
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,320
And I would say, Oh, I know.

189
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,240
Tell me about it.

190
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:56,059
Right.

191
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,980
So I'm saying, yeah, I agree with you.

192
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,480
You are right.

193
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:58,879
Yep.

194
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,059
Very good.

195
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,519
So these phrases.

196
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,460
Okay.

197
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,860
So three great phrases that we just looked at.

198
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,440
Let's listen to our dialogue for the last time.

199
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,879
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

200
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,600
Are you okay, man?

201
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
You don't look very well.

202
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,279
I feel terrible.

203
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,500
I went out last night with Trevor and things got a little out of hand.

204
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:32,220
Nice.

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,519
So where did you guys go?

206
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,379
We hit up a couple of local bars and met up with some friends.

207
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,059
Everything was cool until Mike came along.

208
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:43,259
And it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday.

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,220
Oh no.

210
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:47,019
Mike's birthday is a drink fest for sure.

211
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,419
And tell me about it.

212
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,299
We drank everything in the bar.

213
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,080
Is that why you missed work today?

214
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:52,860
Yeah.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,860
I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous.

216
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,279
I threw up like five times.

217
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:57,899
Ew.

218
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,580
I was so dehydrated that I drank a gallon of water and my head has been pounding all day.

219
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,200
I swear I am never going to drink again.

220
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,460
Too bad, man.

221
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,580
Tonight is Tracy's going away party and she asked if you were going to go.

222
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:11,980
Oh yeah?

223
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:12,779
I'm there.

224
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,500
So it sounds like these guys sure like to go out and have a few drinks, don't they?

225
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, exactly.

226
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,259
And I think this is a very common thing among young people, usually in the United States.

227
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,860
After a day at the office or something, they'll go.

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,899
Or even in Europe, they'll go to the pub, right?

229
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:38,059
Yeah.

230
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:45,620
But the thing is that in America and Canada, we're very careful about alcohol and young people, right?

231
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,120
Yeah, exactly.

232
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:52,460
The legal drinking age in the most part of the United States is 21 years of age.

233
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,740
And really many parents or families will never let their children drink alcohol until they're 21.

234
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:01,799
Right.

235
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:14,460
And also the laws that control alcohol, like for example, on television, if you notice a TV commercial with a beer or a wine, you will never see the person actually drinking it.

236
00:11:14,659 --> 00:11:15,139
It's illegal.

237
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,139
Yeah, that's true.

238
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:17,460
While in other countries, it's okay.

239
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:19,379
You'll see people drinking and having fun.

240
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,740
In these commercials, they can only maybe put them close to their lips, but not drink it.

241
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:24,480
Interesting.

242
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:34,240
I mean, another weird thing is that, you know, sometimes you might want to sit in your back garden or out on your porch and have a beer after work, right?

243
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,059
But in places, it's totally illegal to do that.

244
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,539
You can't be outside with alcohol, right?

245
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,879
You can't be seen drinking or you can't be on the sidewalk or on a bus drinking.

246
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,720
While in other places, you can, right?

247
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,620
You can just have a beer on the subway.

248
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,919
So it's a little bit different policies on alcohol control.

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,600
What do you guys think about it?

250
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,639
Do you think it's correct?

251
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:57,320
Or do you think maybe it's a little bit too exaggerated?

252
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,299
Come to our website, EnglishPod.com and tell us about it.

253
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:01,899
All right.

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,799
We'll see you guys there.

255
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:03,899
And until next time.

256
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,740
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.
