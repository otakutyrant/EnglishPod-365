00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,579
EnglishPod.com It's all over now.

2
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,399
My assignment is complete, and now I have to go back to India.

3
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,500
What?

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,560
Are you kidding?

5
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,060
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

6
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,320
How could you deceive me like that?

7
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:43,439
Yes.

8
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:53,439
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time, and you probably hate me right now, but I want to be completely forthright with you.

9
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,060
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

10
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,840
Veronica, will you marry me?

11
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,820
Come with me to India, baby.

12
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,400
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

13
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,700
I will be the most devoted husband, and I will cherish you always.

14
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,200
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

15
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,099
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

16
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,340
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

17
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,060
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,260
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:31,340
I love you.

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,159
This is the last call for flight 815 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,879
I'm sorry, sir.

22
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,019
We can't wait any longer.

23
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,859
You must board the plane.

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,700
Are you waiting for someone?

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,439
I was, but I don't think she's coming.
