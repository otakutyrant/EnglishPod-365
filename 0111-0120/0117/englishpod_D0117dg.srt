00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,000
EnglishPod.com It's all over now.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My assignment is complete, and now I have to go back to India.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What?

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you kidding?

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How could you deceive me like that?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time, and you probably hate me right now, but I want to be completely forthright with you.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Veronica, will you marry me?

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Come with me to India, baby.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I will be the most devoted husband, and I will cherish you always.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I love you.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is the last call for flight 815 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry, sir.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We can't wait any longer.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You must board the plane.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you waiting for someone?

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was, but I don't think she's coming.
