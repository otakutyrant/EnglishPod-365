00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:05,700
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,080
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,619
And today we're bringing you part 9 of our romantic drama suspense action series, I'm Sorry I Love You.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,339
This is actually our penultimate lesson.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,000
Exactly, this story will end in part 10, so we're almost done.

6
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:22,640
What's happening?

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:30,579
Well, I am pretty excited to find out, so why don't we go straight into the dialogue and catch up with Steven and Veronica.

8
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,520
What?

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,359
Are you kidding?

10
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,859
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,180
How could you deceive me like that?

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,180
Yes.

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,260
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now, but I want to be completely forthright with you.

14
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,760
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,659
Veronica, will you marry me?

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,659
Come with me to India, baby.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

18
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,500
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,019
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

20
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:49,900
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,180
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

22
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,879
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

23
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,079
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:00,819
I love you.

25
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,979
This is the last call for flight A15 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

26
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,699
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,840
We can't wait any longer.

28
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,659
You must board the plane.

29
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,500
Are you waiting for someone?

30
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,300
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,080
All right, so it seems like our poor Steven is going home by himself.

32
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:44,800
Oh, it's so sad.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,340
I know he proposed she didn't accept and now he's going back to India by himself.

34
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:59,520
You know, I think this must be one of the worst feelings in the world, you know, like wondering if the person you love is going to show up at the last minute and realizing they aren't.

35
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,120
I think it's very common of movies.

36
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,360
You always expect the person to come running and show up, but as you can see, our dialogues are more realistic.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,900
So it didn't happen in this occasion.

38
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,659
More realistic.

39
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,219
Okay.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,419
Anyway, let's not debate that topic.

41
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go straight into the language now with language takeaway.

42
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:23,379
All right.

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,360
So today on language takeaway, we have six words that we're going to be looking at, and let's get started with the first one.

44
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:29,719
Okay.

45
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,620
So we've got language about love and language about telling the truth.

46
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,139
And the first one is a word about telling the truth.

47
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,319
So Steven said, I've thought of coming clean.

48
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:41,979
Okay.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,020
To come clean.

50
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:44,020
To come clean.

51
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:50,319
Now, if I want to come clean, it means I want to...

52
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,699
To tell the truth about something you've been hiding.

53
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:53,979
Okay.

54
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,120
So I want to finally tell the truth or confess.

55
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,719
So someone needs to come clean about who stole the chocolate out of the kitchen.

56
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:02,360
Okay.

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,259
Come clean.

58
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,840
So Steven wanted to come clean on many occasions, but Veronica said, how could you deceive me like that?

59
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,719
Deceive someone.

60
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:13,979
How could you deceive me?

61
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,520
So to deceive someone.

62
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,279
All right.

63
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,439
To deceive.

64
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,399
When you deceive somebody, you make them believe something that is untrue.

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,500
So you kind of trick them.

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:26,899
Yeah.

67
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,519
Yeah.

68
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,060
Okay.

69
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:31,600
Make them believe or see something that is not really true.

70
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,160
Exactly.

71
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:32,819
All right.

72
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,560
So that's the verb to deceive.

73
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,519
Now the noun, the action of doing this is called deception.

74
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,100
It was all a great deception.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:42,660
Okay.

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,720
So a big trick, something a big untruth.

77
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
You deceived me.

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,139
All right.

79
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,899
Very good.

80
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,019
And now the opposite of deceive is to be forthright forthright.

81
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,220
So Steven wants to be completely forthright with Veronica.

82
00:04:59,740 --> 00:04:59,980
Okay.

83
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,860
I want to be forthright with you.

84
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,660
All right.

85
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:07,199
When you are forthright with somebody, you are very honest and truthful with them, right?

86
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:07,740
Direct.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,259
You tell them the truth and everything directly.

88
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,360
And you don't, so you don't like hide it or soften it or anything.

89
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,319
Very good.

90
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,759
So forthright.

91
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,360
All right.

92
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,300
So three words about honesty.

93
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,839
Now we've got three words about love for you.

94
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,439
So Steven promised Veronica his undying love.

95
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,500
My undying love.

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,639
My undying love.

97
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:31,339
Now undying.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,620
Well, I think it's pretty, pretty easy, right?

99
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,560
It won't die.

100
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:35,420
It won't die.

101
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,759
Exactly.

102
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:39,319
So he's offering her his, for his love forever.

103
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,399
A very romantic phrase.

104
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:42,399
Very romantic.

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,519
And he also promised to be a devoted husband.

106
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,019
Devoted husband.

107
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,139
I'll be the most devoted husband.

108
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,899
Now this word devoted, what am I saying there?

109
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,819
So as a devoted husband, Steven really, really would love his wife.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,860
He'd really look after her well and he would put all of his energy into that, into his marriage.

111
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,220
Right?

112
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay.

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,040
So he would be very committed to her.

114
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
And work really hard.

115
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,660
Now can I change the noun husband for something else?

116
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,079
Yeah.

117
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,819
We can talk about a devoted friend or a devoted father or a devoted employee.

118
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:18,740
Very good.

119
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,259
And our last word about love.

120
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,680
Well, Steven also promises to cherish Veronica.

121
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:26,740
Okay.

122
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,519
I will cherish you always.

123
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,199
I will cherish you always.

124
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,259
So if I cherish somebody like my girlfriend, what would that mean?

125
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
It means you hold her in your heart.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Like you really love her and you really respect her and you hold her close in your heart.

127
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,759
Okay.

128
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,600
So I respect her and maybe you don't take that person for granted.

129
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,560
Okay.

130
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,860
To cherish someone.

131
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,199
Yeah.

132
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:47,899
All right.

133
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:55,540
So some nice honesty words, some nice love words, and I think now we can move on to some interesting phrases with fluency builder.

134
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,779
Fluency builder.

135
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,079
All right.

136
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,439
So Veronica was upset.

137
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,800
She didn't want to get in back in the car and Steven said, let's talk it over.

138
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,160
Okay.

139
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,399
Let's talk it over.

140
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,879
Let's talk it over.

141
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,600
To talk something over.

142
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,579
Now if I tell you that I want to talk it over, what am I saying?

143
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:17,579
Well, obviously you want to talk about it, right?

144
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:25,160
But you want to talk about it for some time to really talk about all of the problems and the issues and everything.

145
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,300
So to try and make things clear.

146
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,019
Exactly.

147
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:28,980
All right.

148
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,439
And also when he was confessing, he said time and again, I thought of coming clean.

149
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,779
So this phrase time and again.

150
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,300
Time and again.

151
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,100
Time and again.

152
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,279
So that's basically the same as saying again and again or many times, right?

153
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,439
So time and again, I've thought of quitting smoking, but never really have done it.

154
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,319
So you've thought many times of doing it time and again.

155
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,699
Yep.

156
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,839
All right.

157
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,980
So let's go to our next phrase.

158
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,800
Now Veronica said, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

159
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,779
At the drop of a hat.

160
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,379
At the drop of a hat.

161
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,939
So this is a very interesting and colloquial way of saying immediately.

162
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,680
So why don't we hear a few examples of how this is used in English?

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,439
Example one.

164
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,560
My boss expects me to come into work at the drop of a hat.

165
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,620
Example two.

166
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,740
Laura is always willing to help me at the drop of a hat.

167
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Example three.

168
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,019
I can't leave at the drop of a hat.

169
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,299
I need time to prepare.

170
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:34,799
Okay.

171
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,600
So as you can see, you can change it for different things, but basically you're saying I can't do something immediately.

172
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:40,940
Yeah.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,080
And it is almost always attached to this idea of doing something or going somewhere, being somewhere.

174
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,360
Very good.

175
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,500
At the drop of a hat.

176
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,100
All right.

177
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,860
Now our final phrase here for this lesson.

178
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:55,960
So Veronica was saying, I can't go to India at the drop of a hat.

179
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,279
And she also said, I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

180
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:01,860
Okay.

181
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,139
A foundation of lies to build something on a foundation of lies.

182
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,500
Now this is interesting.

183
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,259
Let's take a look at this foundation.

184
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,919
What is that?

185
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,460
Well, you know, you have a house, right?

186
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,279
And the part that's in the ground that supports the house is the foundation.

187
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:17,879
Okay.

188
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,500
So it supports the entire structure, right?

189
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,820
So here she refers to the lies as the foundation.

190
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,159
And that's no way to start a strong relationship.

191
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,620
Is it?

192
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,299
Exactly.

193
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:29,440
Exactly.

194
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,539
So we use it metaphorically in this way, but we can always, but we always have to say it, but we always have to use the verb build.

195
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:38,120
Okay.

196
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,759
So it's basically to make something on a base of something else.

197
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,039
Right?

198
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:42,519
Uh huh.

199
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:48,159
So for example, a strong relationship is built on a foundation of trust.

200
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,799
Or this country was built on a foundation of Liberty.

201
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:53,860
Very good.

202
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,379
So always use foundation with built.

203
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,639
Very good.

204
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,179
Okay.

205
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:58,779
Very interesting.

206
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,360
And well, I think we should listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about Veronica and Steven.

207
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,399
Veronica, wait, come on, honey, get back in the car.

208
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,279
Let's talk it over.

209
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:16,539
Okay.

210
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,279
No, I'm tired of your lies.

211
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,519
I don't know who you are anymore.

212
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,639
Veronica, it's me, the man that has, and always will love you.

213
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,820
I'm sorry that I've lied to you.

214
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,980
Believe me, it's been hard for me as well.

215
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,700
And time and again, I've thought of coming clean, but I couldn't put you or my mission at risk.

216
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,019
It's all over now.

217
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,860
My assignment is complete, and now I have to go back to India.

218
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:39,940
What?

219
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you kidding?

220
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,500
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

221
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,779
How could you deceive me like that?

222
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:57,840
Yes, Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now, but I want to be completely forthright with you.

223
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,500
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

224
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,299
Veronica, will you marry me?

225
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,279
Come with me to India, baby.

226
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,840
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

227
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,139
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

228
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,679
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat with everything that has happened between us.

229
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,559
I just don't know you anymore.

230
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,799
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

231
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,500
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

232
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:34,659
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,179
I love you.

234
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:49,600
This is the last call for flight 815 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

235
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,340
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,500
We can't wait any longer.

237
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,299
You must board the plane.

238
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,139
Are you waiting for someone?

239
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,919
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

240
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,840
So Marco, I think I see a bit of a tear there in the corner of your eye.

241
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:18,759
I'm very sad.

242
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,539
I can't believe he proposed and she just said no.

243
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:22,399
Just like that.

244
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,779
That's not supposed to happen.

245
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,679
And plus he was inviting her to India and exotic getaway and well, exotic, exotic getaway for the, for the rest of her life.

246
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,340
Well, what do you think will happen?

247
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,379
Part 10, it all ends.

248
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:41,539
So do you think they all just keep on living their separate lives?

249
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:42,620
Will they meet again?

250
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,940
Who knows?
