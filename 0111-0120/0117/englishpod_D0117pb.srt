00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're bringing you part 9 of our romantic drama suspense action series, I'm Sorry I Love You.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is actually our penultimate lesson.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Exactly, this story will end in part 10, so we're almost done.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's happening?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, I am pretty excited to find out, so why don't we go straight into the dialogue and catch up with Steven and Veronica.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you kidding?

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How could you deceive me like that?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now, but I want to be completely forthright with you.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Veronica, will you marry me?

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Come with me to India, baby.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
With everything that has happened between us, I just don't know you anymore.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I love you.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is the last call for flight A15 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry, sir.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We can't wait any longer.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You must board the plane.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you waiting for someone?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, so it seems like our poor Steven is going home by himself.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, it's so sad.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know he proposed she didn't accept and now he's going back to India by himself.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You know, I think this must be one of the worst feelings in the world, you know, like wondering if the person you love is going to show up at the last minute and realizing they aren't.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think it's very common of movies.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You always expect the person to come running and show up, but as you can see, our dialogues are more realistic.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So it didn't happen in this occasion.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,000
More realistic.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay.

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Anyway, let's not debate that topic.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go straight into the language now with language takeaway.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
All right.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So today on language takeaway, we have six words that we're going to be looking at, and let's get started with the first one.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we've got language about love and language about telling the truth.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And the first one is a word about telling the truth.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So Steven said, I've thought of coming clean.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
To come clean.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
To come clean.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, if I want to come clean, it means I want to...

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
To tell the truth about something you've been hiding.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So I want to finally tell the truth or confess.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So someone needs to come clean about who stole the chocolate out of the kitchen.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Come clean.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So Steven wanted to come clean on many occasions, but Veronica said, how could you deceive me like that?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Deceive someone.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How could you deceive me?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So to deceive someone.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All right.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
To deceive.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When you deceive somebody, you make them believe something that is untrue.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So you kind of trick them.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Make them believe or see something that is not really true.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Exactly.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
All right.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So that's the verb to deceive.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now the noun, the action of doing this is called deception.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was all a great deception.

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So a big trick, something a big untruth.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You deceived me.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Very good.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And now the opposite of deceive is to be forthright forthright.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So Steven wants to be completely forthright with Veronica.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to be forthright with you.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
All right.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When you are forthright with somebody, you are very honest and truthful with them, right?

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Direct.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You tell them the truth and everything directly.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And you don't, so you don't like hide it or soften it or anything.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Very good.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So forthright.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So three words about honesty.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Now we've got three words about love for you.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So Steven promised Veronica his undying love.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
My undying love.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
My undying love.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now undying.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, I think it's pretty, pretty easy, right?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It won't die.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It won't die.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Exactly.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So he's offering her his, for his love forever.

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A very romantic phrase.

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Very romantic.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And he also promised to be a devoted husband.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Devoted husband.

107
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll be the most devoted husband.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Now this word devoted, what am I saying there?

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So as a devoted husband, Steven really, really would love his wife.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He'd really look after her well and he would put all of his energy into that, into his marriage.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Right?

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So he would be very committed to her.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And work really hard.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Now can I change the noun husband for something else?

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We can talk about a devoted friend or a devoted father or a devoted employee.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Very good.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And our last word about love.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, Steven also promises to cherish Veronica.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I will cherish you always.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I will cherish you always.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So if I cherish somebody like my girlfriend, what would that mean?

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It means you hold her in your heart.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Like you really love her and you really respect her and you hold her close in your heart.

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So I respect her and maybe you don't take that person for granted.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
To cherish someone.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yeah.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So some nice honesty words, some nice love words, and I think now we can move on to some interesting phrases with fluency builder.

134
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Fluency builder.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
All right.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So Veronica was upset.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She didn't want to get in back in the car and Steven said, let's talk it over.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's talk it over.

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's talk it over.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
To talk something over.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now if I tell you that I want to talk it over, what am I saying?

143
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, obviously you want to talk about it, right?

144
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But you want to talk about it for some time to really talk about all of the problems and the issues and everything.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So to try and make things clear.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Exactly.

147
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
And also when he was confessing, he said time and again, I thought of coming clean.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So this phrase time and again.

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Time and again.

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Time and again.

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So that's basically the same as saying again and again or many times, right?

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So time and again, I've thought of quitting smoking, but never really have done it.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So you've thought many times of doing it time and again.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yep.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,000
All right.

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So let's go to our next phrase.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Now Veronica said, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
At the drop of a hat.

160
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
At the drop of a hat.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So this is a very interesting and colloquial way of saying immediately.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So why don't we hear a few examples of how this is used in English?

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Example one.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
My boss expects me to come into work at the drop of a hat.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Example two.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Laura is always willing to help me at the drop of a hat.

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Example three.

168
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't leave at the drop of a hat.

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I need time to prepare.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Okay.

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So as you can see, you can change it for different things, but basically you're saying I can't do something immediately.

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And it is almost always attached to this idea of doing something or going somewhere, being somewhere.

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Very good.

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
At the drop of a hat.

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
All right.

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now our final phrase here for this lesson.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So Veronica was saying, I can't go to India at the drop of a hat.

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And she also said, I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Okay.

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A foundation of lies to build something on a foundation of lies.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Now this is interesting.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's take a look at this foundation.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What is that?

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Well, you know, you have a house, right?

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And the part that's in the ground that supports the house is the foundation.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So it supports the entire structure, right?

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So here she refers to the lies as the foundation.

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And that's no way to start a strong relationship.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Is it?

192
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Exactly.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Exactly.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So we use it metaphorically in this way, but we can always, but we always have to say it, but we always have to use the verb build.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So it's basically to make something on a base of something else.

197
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right?

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Uh huh.

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So for example, a strong relationship is built on a foundation of trust.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Or this country was built on a foundation of Liberty.

201
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Very good.

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So always use foundation with built.

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Very good.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Very interesting.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And well, I think we should listen to this dialogue for the last time, and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about Veronica and Steven.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Veronica, wait, come on, honey, get back in the car.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's talk it over.

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Okay.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, I'm tired of your lies.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know who you are anymore.

212
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Veronica, it's me, the man that has, and always will love you.

213
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry that I've lied to you.

214
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Believe me, it's been hard for me as well.

215
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And time and again, I've thought of coming clean, but I couldn't put you or my mission at risk.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's all over now.

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
My assignment is complete, and now I have to go back to India.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What?

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you kidding?

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is there anything else I should know before I never see you again?

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How could you deceive me like that?

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes, Veronica, I know that this isn't the best time and you probably hate me right now, but I want to be completely forthright with you.

223
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I know deep in my heart that you are the best thing that has ever happened to me.

224
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Veronica, will you marry me?

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Come with me to India, baby.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't make it for everything that's happened, but I can promise you my undying love.

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I will be the most devoted husband and I will cherish you always.

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Steven, I can't just leave everything at the drop of a hat with everything that has happened between us.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I just don't know you anymore.

230
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I just can't build a relationship on a foundation of lies.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I do love you, but I can't go with you.

232
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I love you.

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is the last call for flight 815 from Los Angeles to Hyderabad.

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry, sir.

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We can't wait any longer.

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You must board the plane.

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Are you waiting for someone?

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was, but I don't think she's coming.

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So Marco, I think I see a bit of a tear there in the corner of your eye.

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm very sad.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't believe he proposed and she just said no.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Just like that.

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's not supposed to happen.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And plus he was inviting her to India and exotic getaway and well, exotic, exotic getaway for the, for the rest of her life.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, what do you think will happen?

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Part 10, it all ends.

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So do you think they all just keep on living their separate lives?

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Will they meet again?

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Who knows?
