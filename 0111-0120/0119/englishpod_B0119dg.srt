00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:09,660
EnglishPod.com Eddie, why are we at this scary-looking mansion?

2
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:12,000
It's like ultra-spooky.

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:13,759
I told you already, Shabby.

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,980
The owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,199
So we have to go in and investigate.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,940
I don't like this.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,440
Come on, guys.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,160
Stop being such cowards.

9
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:31,160
It's a mystery and an adventure.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,719
This place gives me the creeps.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,820
Seriously, guys, let's get out of here.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,079
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,240
Shabby is a scaredy-cat.

14
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:50,200
That lamp came from this room.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,740
Let's go and check it out.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,520
Look!

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,240
A ghost!

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,899
Run!
