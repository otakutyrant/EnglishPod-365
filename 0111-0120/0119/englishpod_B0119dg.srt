00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Eddie, why are we at this scary-looking mansion?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's like ultra-spooky.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I told you already, Shabby.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So we have to go in and investigate.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't like this.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Come on, guys.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Stop being such cowards.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a mystery and an adventure.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
This place gives me the creeps.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Seriously, guys, let's get out of here.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Shabby is a scaredy-cat.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That lamp came from this room.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's go and check it out.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Look!

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A ghost!

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Run!
