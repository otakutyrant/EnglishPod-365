00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we have a fun and scary dialogue.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right, this lesson is full of language you can use to talk about being scared.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Alright, so we're going to be looking at a scary lesson today.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And we have nothing to preview, so let's listen to this dialogue and see why everyone is so scared.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's like ultra spooky.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I told you already Shabby, the owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So we have to go in and investigate.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I don't like this.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come on guys, stop being such cowards.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's a mystery and an adventure.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This place gives me the creeps.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Seriously guys, let's get out of here.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That laugh is scary.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, that sounds really scary.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But actually it kind of reminds me of another TV show.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Very similar to another TV show, but it's different.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, but some interesting language that you can use to talk about things that are scary.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So why don't we look at that now in language takeaway.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Language takeaway.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So let's start with the very first line of our dialogue.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Shabby described the mansion to be ultra spooky.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's ultra spooky.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Spooky.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So okay, we've got two interesting words here.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ultra and spooky.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now spooky is scary, right?

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a little bit scary.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It maybe makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable or maybe it makes you feel a little bit scared.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay, so not very scared.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Not super scared.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But ultra spooky.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So ultra is another way of saying super or very or really spooky.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So if it's ultra spooky, then it's very scary.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright, so our next word.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
They said that in the house there is a ghost haunting the house.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, there is a ghost haunting his house.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay, so the verb to haunt.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, to haunt.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So the ghost is coming to the house frequently and not letting them live in peace.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
When a ghost haunts something, it visits it often and scares it.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Exactly.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now they were all afraid and they didn't want to go in and so Wilma called everyone cowards.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Stop being such cowards.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Cowards.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So a coward.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A coward is a person that's not brave.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A person who's scared of everything.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Exactly.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So they were being cowards.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They were afraid so that's why they didn't want to go in.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well speaking of being afraid, Shabby said I'm getting goosebumps.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Goosebumps.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
To get goosebumps.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Alright, to get goosebumps.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Now goosebumps, it may sound a little bit strange but it's very easy when you're scared or maybe you're cold.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The skin on your arms or on your back gets a little bit bumpy.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So your skin looks like chicken skin.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Exactly, chicken skin.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And that's actually how we call it in Spanish, chicken skin.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But this is goosebumps so I guess it's kind of similar.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A goose?

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, same idea.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Goosebumps.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright and finally Scruffy said Shabby is a scaredy cat.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
A scaredy cat.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A scaredy cat.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're a scaredy cat.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well a scaredy cat is not really a cat, right?

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, no, no.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a person who is afraid of everything.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Similar to a coward.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But more informal.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Much more informal.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So somebody is a scaredy cat.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I think even a little bit more juvenile.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So children use it?

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yeah, as adults you wouldn't say he's a scaredy cat.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Alright great, so some interesting scary language.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think we need to hear it one more time, slowed down in the dialogue.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's like ultra spooky.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I told you already Shabby, the owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So we have to go in and investigate.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't like this.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Come on guys, stop being such cowards.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's a mystery and an adventure.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This place gives me the creeps.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Seriously guys, let's get out of here.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That laugh came from this room.

100
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's go and check it out.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Look, a ghost.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Run.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay so now that we understand all the vocabulary we saw in language takeaway, why don't we take a look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Fluency Builder.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well Shabby is a scaredy cat.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So Shabby said, we're at this scary looking mansion.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Scary looking mansion.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So a scary looking mansion.

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay so the mansion looks scary.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Alright so a mansion is a big house right that looks very scary.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now this is a really useful and helpful pattern you can use with English.

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Something looking, so adjective looking.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right so you can say good looking.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And there's lots of examples so why don't we hear a few more now.

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Example one.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That guy is making me nervous.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's really creepy looking.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Example two.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I saw the craziest looking house today.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It was built upside down.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Example three.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What a nice looking dog.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Can I pet him?

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Alright great examples and now we know how we can combine looking with different adjectives.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Our next phrase Shabby said, this place gives me the creeps.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Alright gives me the creeps.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
To give someone the creeps.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So if something gives you the creeps.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It makes you feel uncomfortable and scared.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Maybe scared, maybe nervous.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay so why don't we give some examples.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I could say, hey Marco see that guy over there?

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He keeps looking at me.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's gonna say clowns give me the creeps.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh that's right you're afraid of clowns.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I am afraid of clowns.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
They give me the creeps.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Alright well it's a really helpful useful phrase to use when you're talking about being afraid.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Now why don't we listen to the dialogue one final time.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Eddie why are we at this scary looking mansion?

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's like ultra spooky.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I think there's a ghost haunting his house.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So we have to go in and investigate.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't like this.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come on guys stop being such cowards.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a mystery and an adventure.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This place gives me the creeps.

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Seriously guys let's get out of here.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That laugh came from this room.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go and check it out.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Look a ghost run.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm scared of clowns.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm scared of clowns.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm scared of clowns Okay so an interesting dialogue about ghosts and haunted houses.

157
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So what do you think Erica do you believe in ghosts?

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Have you ever seen a ghost?

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No I totally do not believe in ghosts but I understand that you disagree with me.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Well I've experienced strange things but I don't know if it was a ghost or an alien.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know it could have been anything.

162
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
An alien.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
An invisible alien.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay so what happened?

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Well once I was having dinner with my parents and we had a table and on top of the table there was a glass full of water and all of a sudden it started to move across the table and then it started to spin while it moved.

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So was there an earthquake or something happening?

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No nothing we were just the only thing on the whole table that was moving was that and we all just kind of stared at the glass moving and we didn't know what to do and then my mom started kind of giggling a nervous laugh and we really didn't know what happened.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now I understand that in Latin America people are more superstitious they're more they believe more in ghosts right?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Exactly in Latin America people are very superstitious they believe in ghosts or in spirits or we have a lot of urban legends about you know like a leprechaun that lives under a bridge or you know somebody's grandma that comes and haunts them or visits them at night and stuff like that so yeah Latin American people are very superstitious in this sense.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yeah I think in Anglo countries it's a little bit less common to say that you believe in ghosts like maybe inside you you think ghosts are true but you wouldn't really tell people that.

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Right I think the difference would be that you have a different type of superstition like people are afraid of black cats or the floor or the number 13.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah or opening your umbrella in a house.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Exactly yeah so because they consider it to be bad luck but not because something like a ghost or an alien is gonna come out and eat them.
