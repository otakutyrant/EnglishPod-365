00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello English learners, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,379
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:07,839
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,419 --> 00:00:11,640
And today we have a fun and scary dialogue.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,879
That's right, this lesson is full of language you can use to talk about being scared.

6
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:23,199
Alright, so we're going to be looking at a scary lesson today.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,719
And we have nothing to preview, so let's listen to this dialogue and see why everyone is so scared.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,740
Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,100
It's like ultra spooky.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,039
I told you already Shabby, the owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

11
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,299
So we have to go in and investigate.

12
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,060
I don't like this.

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,240
Come on guys, stop being such cowards.

14
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,240
It's a mystery and an adventure.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,820
This place gives me the creeps.

16
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,920
Seriously guys, let's get out of here.

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,519
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

18
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,540
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

19
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:36,040
That laugh is scary.

20
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,420
Well, that sounds really scary.

21
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,959
But actually it kind of reminds me of another TV show.

22
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,459
Very similar to another TV show, but it's different.

23
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,040
Okay, but some interesting language that you can use to talk about things that are scary.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,659
So why don't we look at that now in language takeaway.

25
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,480
Language takeaway.

26
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,280
So let's start with the very first line of our dialogue.

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,319
Shabby described the mansion to be ultra spooky.

28
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,060
It's ultra spooky.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,180
Spooky.

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,259
So okay, we've got two interesting words here.

31
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,819
Ultra and spooky.

32
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,979
Now spooky is scary, right?

33
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,159
It's a little bit scary.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,819
It maybe makes you feel a little bit uncomfortable or maybe it makes you feel a little bit scared.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,219
Okay, so not very scared.

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,879
Not super scared.

37
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,819
But ultra spooky.

38
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,039
So ultra is another way of saying super or very or really spooky.

39
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,979
So if it's ultra spooky, then it's very scary.

40
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Okay.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,680
Alright, so our next word.

42
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,900
They said that in the house there is a ghost haunting the house.

43
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,300
Okay, there is a ghost haunting his house.

44
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,199
Okay, so the verb to haunt.

45
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, to haunt.

46
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:58,159
So the ghost is coming to the house frequently and not letting them live in peace.

47
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,300
When a ghost haunts something, it visits it often and scares it.

48
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,000
Exactly.

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,580
Now they were all afraid and they didn't want to go in and so Wilma called everyone cowards.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,479
Stop being such cowards.

51
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:12,740
Cowards.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,060
So a coward.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,680
A coward is a person that's not brave.

54
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,199
A person who's scared of everything.

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,000
Exactly.

56
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,199
So they were being cowards.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,000
They were afraid so that's why they didn't want to go in.

58
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,240
Well speaking of being afraid, Shabby said I'm getting goosebumps.

59
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:31,539
Goosebumps.

60
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,180
To get goosebumps.

61
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,860
Alright, to get goosebumps.

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:41,939
Now goosebumps, it may sound a little bit strange but it's very easy when you're scared or maybe you're cold.

63
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,699
The skin on your arms or on your back gets a little bit bumpy.

64
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,039
So your skin looks like chicken skin.

65
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,379
Exactly, chicken skin.

66
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:52,659
And that's actually how we call it in Spanish, chicken skin.

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,340
But this is goosebumps so I guess it's kind of similar.

68
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:55,860
A goose?

69
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:57,699
Yeah, same idea.

70
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,819
Goosebumps.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,319
Alright and finally Scruffy said Shabby is a scaredy cat.

72
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,819
A scaredy cat.

73
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,780
A scaredy cat.

74
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,180
You're a scaredy cat.

75
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,120
Well a scaredy cat is not really a cat, right?

76
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:10,879
No, no, no.

77
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,939
It's a person who is afraid of everything.

78
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,419
Okay.

79
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,520
Similar to a coward.

80
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,339
But more informal.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,819
Much more informal.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
So somebody is a scaredy cat.

83
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,920
And I think even a little bit more juvenile.

84
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,600
So children use it?

85
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,060
Yeah, as adults you wouldn't say he's a scaredy cat.

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,339
Alright great, so some interesting scary language.

87
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,819
I think we need to hear it one more time, slowed down in the dialogue.

88
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,319
Eddie, why are we at this scary looking mansion?

89
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,680
It's like ultra spooky.

90
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,620
I told you already Shabby, the owner of the house says there's a ghost haunting his house.

91
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,860
So we have to go in and investigate.

92
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,379
I don't like this.

93
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:58,620
Come on guys, stop being such cowards.

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,600
It's a mystery and an adventure.

95
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,180
This place gives me the creeps.

96
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,240
Seriously guys, let's get out of here.

97
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,439
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

98
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,699
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

99
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,899
That laugh came from this room.

100
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,560
Let's go and check it out.

101
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,240
Look, a ghost.

102
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:20,860
Run.

103
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:31,980
Okay so now that we understand all the vocabulary we saw in language takeaway, why don't we take a look at two phrases now in Fluency Builder.

104
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,360
Fluency Builder.

105
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:35,879
Well Shabby is a scaredy cat.

106
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,480
So Shabby said, we're at this scary looking mansion.

107
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,800
Scary looking mansion.

108
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,459
So a scary looking mansion.

109
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,800
Okay so the mansion looks scary.

110
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,100
Alright so a mansion is a big house right that looks very scary.

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,399
Now this is a really useful and helpful pattern you can use with English.

112
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
Something looking, so adjective looking.

113
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,439
Right so you can say good looking.

114
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,800
And there's lots of examples so why don't we hear a few more now.

115
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,620
Example one.

116
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,899
That guy is making me nervous.

117
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:12,699
He's really creepy looking.

118
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,180
Example two.

119
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,079
I saw the craziest looking house today.

120
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:19,899
It was built upside down.

121
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,079
Example three.

122
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,399
What a nice looking dog.

123
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:25,500
Can I pet him?

124
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:32,060
Alright great examples and now we know how we can combine looking with different adjectives.

125
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,819
Our next phrase Shabby said, this place gives me the creeps.

126
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,259
Alright gives me the creeps.

127
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,560
To give someone the creeps.

128
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,240
So if something gives you the creeps.

129
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,879
It makes you feel uncomfortable and scared.

130
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:49,639
Maybe scared, maybe nervous.

131
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:53,139
Okay so why don't we give some examples.

132
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,420
I could say, hey Marco see that guy over there?

133
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,920
He keeps looking at me.

134
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,939
He's gonna say clowns give me the creeps.

135
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,740
Oh that's right you're afraid of clowns.

136
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,720
I am afraid of clowns.

137
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,759
They give me the creeps.

138
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,500
Alright well it's a really helpful useful phrase to use when you're talking about being afraid.

139
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,500
Now why don't we listen to the dialogue one final time.

140
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,379
Eddie why are we at this scary looking mansion?

141
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,720
It's like ultra spooky.

142
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,660
I think there's a ghost haunting his house.

143
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,920
So we have to go in and investigate.

144
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,680
I don't like this.

145
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:44,860
Come on guys stop being such cowards.

146
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,879
It's a mystery and an adventure.

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,459
This place gives me the creeps.

148
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:52,560
Seriously guys let's get out of here.

149
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,459
I'm getting goosebumps just being here.

150
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,240
Shabby is a scaredy cat.

151
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:05,939
That laugh came from this room.

152
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,879
Let's go and check it out.

153
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,699
Look a ghost run.

154
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,560
I'm scared of clowns.

155
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,560
I'm scared of clowns.

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,620
I'm scared of clowns Okay so an interesting dialogue about ghosts and haunted houses.

157
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,660
So what do you think Erica do you believe in ghosts?

158
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,720
Have you ever seen a ghost?

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,320
No I totally do not believe in ghosts but I understand that you disagree with me.

160
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,820
Well I've experienced strange things but I don't know if it was a ghost or an alien.

161
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,179
I don't know it could have been anything.

162
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,100
An alien.

163
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,500
An invisible alien.

164
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay so what happened?

165
00:08:51,460 --> 00:09:06,179
Well once I was having dinner with my parents and we had a table and on top of the table there was a glass full of water and all of a sudden it started to move across the table and then it started to spin while it moved.

166
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,340
So was there an earthquake or something happening?

167
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:23,000
No nothing we were just the only thing on the whole table that was moving was that and we all just kind of stared at the glass moving and we didn't know what to do and then my mom started kind of giggling a nervous laugh and we really didn't know what happened.

168
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:31,080
Now I understand that in Latin America people are more superstitious they're more they believe more in ghosts right?

169
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:52,440
Exactly in Latin America people are very superstitious they believe in ghosts or in spirits or we have a lot of urban legends about you know like a leprechaun that lives under a bridge or you know somebody's grandma that comes and haunts them or visits them at night and stuff like that so yeah Latin American people are very superstitious in this sense.

170
00:09:52,820 --> 00:10:03,320
Yeah I think in Anglo countries it's a little bit less common to say that you believe in ghosts like maybe inside you you think ghosts are true but you wouldn't really tell people that.

171
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:13,580
Right I think the difference would be that you have a different type of superstition like people are afraid of black cats or the floor or the number 13.

172
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,679
Yeah or opening your umbrella in a house.

173
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:23,500
Exactly yeah so because they consider it to be bad luck but not because something like a ghost or an alien is gonna come out and eat them.
