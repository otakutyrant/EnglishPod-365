00:00:02,079 --> 00:00:03,279
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,820
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:06,940
And my name is Erica.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,039
Today we're bringing you another one of our sports lessons and this time we're going to go to a boxing match.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:13,740
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,039
So we're going to be learning a language that you can use if you're talking about boxing, but not only boxing, right?

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,480
Right.

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,859
We can also use this language for describing a fight or somebody that's fighting.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:25,899
Okay.

11
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:32,759
So not that we're asking our listeners to get into fights, but if ever you see a fight, at least now you'll have the language to talk about it.

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,799
Exactly.

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,799
So let's listen to a dialogue for the first time.

14
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:38,840
It might sound familiar.

15
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:45,600
We have the legendary Rocky Balboa at EnglishPod fighting for the heavyweight championship.

16
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,200
So let's see what happens.

17
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,340
Welcome back boxing fans.

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,770
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man with the modern jaw, Bob Copeland.

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,070
Thank you, Rick.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,310
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:09,650
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel and Casino where the world heavyweight championship is about to get underway.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,290
That's right, Bob.

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:20,329
We're about to witness the legendary Italian Stallion himself, Rocky Balboa square off against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

24
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:22,969
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,049
Both fighters are in the ring and we are about to begin.

26
00:01:28,849 --> 00:01:43,750
In the blue corner, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world, the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

27
00:01:45,989 --> 00:02:04,709
In the red corner, weighing 218 pounds and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts, the undefeated undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

28
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,129
There's the bell and this fight is underway.

29
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,069
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,189
Rocky dodges successfully and counter attacks with a strong right hook.

31
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,469
Apollo is caught.

32
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,069
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

33
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:26,909
This is his chance.

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,889
Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left.

35
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,930
Apollo is getting pounded.

36
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,150
Apollo recovers with a powerful hay maker and catches Rocky off guard.

37
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,229
He's down.

38
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,069
The ref starts the count.

39
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:50,610
One, two, three, four, five.

40
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,050
Wow, sounds like a great fight.

41
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,590
Amazing fight and I don't know who's going to win.

42
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,370
Rocky apparently got knocked down.

43
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:02,229
What do you think will happen?

44
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,409
Well, if I know anything about Rocky Balboa, he will not stay knocked down for long.

45
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:12,430
All right, so let's take a look at some of the language we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

46
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,590
Language Takeaway.

47
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,490
Well, Rick Field said that we have a very gruesome match tonight.

48
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,629
A gruesome match.

49
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,530
Gruesome.

50
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,030
All right, so if something is gruesome.

51
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:30,629
It's really, it's bad, it's terrible, it's bloody.

52
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,789
Okay, bloody, terrible, very hard or like gruesome fight would be a very bloody fight.

53
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:38,509
Yeah, or a gruesome film.

54
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:40,389
Okay, very good.

55
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,569
So gruesome.

56
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,509
Now, they mentioned that both fighters are in the ring.

57
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,189
Both fighters are in the ring.

58
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,030
The ring.

59
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,969
Okay, so the ring is the physical space where they fight.

60
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,069
But isn't it square?

61
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,729
Yeah, it is square.

62
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:58,650
It's not really circular, but it's called a boxing ring.

63
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,810
I'm not really sure why.

64
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,449
Well, maybe one of our listeners knows and can tell us about that because I am not an expert on boxing.

65
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,849
But what I do know is our next word.

66
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:15,909
They were describing Rocky Balboa's career and they said he had 37 knockouts.

67
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,790
Okay, a knockout.

68
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,850
A knockout.

69
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,709
In this sense, knockout is a noun.

70
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:32,550
A knockout is when the fighter hits the other fighter and he falls to the ground and he can't get up in 10 seconds because he's tired, he's dizzy, he's hurt.

71
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:34,269
Okay, so that's a knockout.

72
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,410
Okay, so this is a technical boxing word.

73
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,069
It's the action of falling to the ground and not getting up.

74
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,189
Right, but there's also a verb.

75
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,910
To knock out.

76
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:48,009
Or to knock someone out.

77
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,550
Exactly.

78
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,529
So when you say, I knocked this guy out.

79
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,949
It means I hit him so hard that he fell to the floor and maybe he was unconscious for a while.

80
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,250
So he fell asleep basically.

81
00:04:59,509 --> 00:04:59,769
Almost.

82
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,870
So it's very similar, the noun form to the verb form.

83
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,009
Like basically if you knock someone out, you get a knockout.

84
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,889
Okay, so to knock someone out, a knockout.

85
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:17,790
Alright, now for our next word we saw as Apollo quickly began to jab Rocky Balboa.

86
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,730
So the noun, a jab.

87
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,209
So a jab.

88
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,509
Quick jabs.

89
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,170
So a jab is a kind of punch, right?

90
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,970
It's a fast, short, but not very strong punch.

91
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:30,569
Okay, so a technical boxing word.

92
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:31,430
A jab.

93
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,050
A jab.

94
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,629
This can also be a verb, right?

95
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,990
Right, so to jab.

96
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,209
To jab.

97
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:41,329
Now Apollo was throwing jabs and Rocky began to dodge.

98
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:42,810
Alright, and that's our next word.

99
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,910
To dodge.

100
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:44,769
Dodge.

101
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,209
D-O-D-G-E.

102
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,009
To dodge.

103
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,829
Alright, so if you dodge, you're trying to avoid getting hit.

104
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,589
Right, so you move your body so that you're not hit.

105
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,350
Exactly.

106
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,970
Now we can also use it in different ways.

107
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,250
Not only do you dodge when somebody is trying to punch you, you can also, for example, dodge a bullet.

108
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:08,769
Right, so when you dodge a bullet, you avoid some bad situation or some bad event.

109
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:15,350
Right, so we have many examples of dodge used in other contexts, so why don't we listen to some examples.

110
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,430
Example one.

111
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,129
See that guy dodging through the traffic?

112
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:22,449
He's going to get hit by a car if he's not careful.

113
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:24,529
Example two.

114
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,189
Well, the storm turned south, so it looks like we managed to dodge a bullet.

115
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,230
Example three.

116
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,110
Look, you're the one who is in charge of sales and the numbers are down.

117
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,790
It's your problem, so stop trying to dodge your responsibilities.

118
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,810
You know, that word reminds me of another sport, dodgeball.

119
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,110
Oh, dodgeball, exactly, same principle.

120
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:46,670
Yeah, that's an entirely different lesson.

121
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,170
I think we need to focus here on the boxing vocabulary.

122
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:55,750
So the announcers said that Apollo is getting pounded.

123
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,149
To get pounded.

124
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,230
To get pounded.

125
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,230
Now, if someone is getting pounded, they're getting hit really hard and a lot.

126
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,230
So to get pounded.

127
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,009
Get pounded.

128
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,889
And now we have one more word and it's also another boxing term called a haymaker.

129
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,410
A powerful haymaker.

130
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:21,170
Okay, so Apollo received a powerful haymaker.

131
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,310
Now, this word is actually new to me, so Marco, what does it mean?

132
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:28,449
Basically, it's a very strong, very wild punch.

133
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,269
Okay, so you don't have really good form.

134
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,709
Your body is kind of moving all over the place.

135
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:40,850
Right, so you don't have much balance, so you just throw your entire body and your fist at someone to hit them as hard as you can.

136
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:41,750
That's a haymaker.

137
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:44,829
All right, a technical boxing word here for you guys.

138
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,610
But now we've got some interesting phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

139
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,069
Fluency Builder.

140
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:58,370
All right, so on Fluency Builder today, we're going to take a look at some of these phrases and we have four of them for you today.

141
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,850
So let's get started with the first one.

142
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,629
Well, the announcer said that the boxing match was about to get underway.

143
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,829
Okay, to get underway.

144
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,670
To get underway.

145
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:14,050
So again, this is another way of saying about to begin.

146
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:14,410
Right.

147
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,389
All right, so we're about to get underway with this new project.

148
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,870
Or the meeting's just about to get underway, so make sure everyone's here.

149
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:22,769
Very good.

150
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:31,649
So the match was about to get underway and the sports announcer said that Rocky Balboa is going to square off against his lifetime rival.

151
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:35,830
So we're going to look at this phrase to square off against someone.

152
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,289
All right, I'm going to square off against Jim.

153
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:46,429
All right, when you square off against Jim, you get ready to fight with him or to compete with him, right?

154
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,269
Right, so we're about to have a one-to-one competition.

155
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:56,309
So this is like a sports word, but it's also really commonly used in a lot of different contexts.

156
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,629
So why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use this phrase to square off.

157
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:02,350
Example one.

158
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:08,169
The two countries are moving their armies close to the borders as they prepare to square off in a border dispute.

159
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,389
Example two.

160
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,490
Italy and Brazil are squaring off in the final game this afternoon.

161
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,129
Example three.

162
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,350
Lisa and Daniel squared off against each other in the marketing meeting today.

163
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,169
They were both pretty angry.

164
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,669
All right, so great examples and I think we can use it now, not only in boxing but in other situations.

165
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,070
Now Bob said that Rocky landed a strong blow.

166
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,649
To land a strong blow.

167
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,250
All right, so land a strong blow.

168
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,809
Now let's break this down.

169
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,750
So a blow.

170
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,710
A blow is a punch or a hit.

171
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,750
Okay, and when you land a strong blow, what happens?

172
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:52,570
You basically successfully hit your opponent with a punch or hit.

173
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,909
So you hit them, so your fist meets their body.

174
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:58,889
Yes, so your fist landed on their body.

175
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:01,169
So I could also change this a little bit.

176
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,590
I could say, I landed a punch.

177
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,350
Right, or in boxing terms, he landed a strong left jab.

178
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,710
Okay, so to land a blow.

179
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,889
The announcer described it as Rock threw a left.

180
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,049
To throw a left.

181
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,590
So he said he threw a left and right.

182
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,669
Now again, we'll take this one apart.

183
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:20,710
So a left.

184
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:21,769
What are we talking about?

185
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,769
Basically a left punch, but we can omit punch.

186
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,330
Okay, so it's a punch with your left hand, but the verb throw.

187
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,690
You throw a left punch.

188
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,210
So basically you punch somebody with your left.

189
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,450
Okay, so it's just another way of saying to punch someone.

190
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,330
To punch someone, right.

191
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,850
So Bob started to throw some punches at the other guy.

192
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,070
All right, or look over there, that guy's throwing punches.

193
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,470
All right, so to throw a left, to throw a punch.

194
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,070
Now again, you can use this in a lot of different ways with a lot of different types of punches.

195
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,850
So you could say to throw a jab.

196
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,490
Okay, or throw an uppercut.

197
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,370
Or throw a hook.

198
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:09,549
Okay, so now that we've seen all these phrases, why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time and we'll come back in a little bit.

199
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,149
Welcome back, boxing fans.

200
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,309
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man with the iron jaw, Bob Copeland.

201
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,850
Thank you, Rick.

202
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,070
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

203
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:31,450
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel and Casino where the World Heavyweight Championship is about to get underway.

204
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,070
That's right, Bob.

205
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:42,149
We're about to witness the legendary Italian Stallion himself, Rocky Balboa, square off against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

206
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,789
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

207
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,830
Both fighters are in the ring and we are about to begin.

208
00:11:50,669 --> 00:12:05,789
In the blue corner, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world, the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

209
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:26,649
In the red corner, weighing 218 pounds and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts, the undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

210
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,929
There's the bell and this fight is underway.

211
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,870
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

212
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,990
Rocky dodges successfully and counter attacks with a strong right hook.

213
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,289
Apollo is cut.

214
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,870
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

215
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,690
This is his chance.

216
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:52,669
Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left.

217
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,750
Apollo is getting pounded.

218
00:12:55,429 --> 00:13:00,009
Apollo recovers with a powerful haymaker and catches Rocky off guard.

219
00:13:00,509 --> 00:13:01,070
He's down.

220
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,929
The ref starts the count.

221
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:12,090
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

222
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:26,210
So as I mentioned, Marco, I'm not really that much of a fan or that knowledgeable about boxing.

223
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:30,289
And actually, this is becoming a theme in any sports lesson, isn't it?

224
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,809
Well, boxing is a very popular sport in North America.

225
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:49,389
I'm not really that big of a fan, but I have seen a couple of matches and it's very interesting because as we saw in our dialogue, most big fights take place in Las Vegas at some big hotel.

226
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:49,950
Right.

227
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:57,370
But you said it's super popular and everyone wants to watch these these matches and obviously everyone can't go to Las Vegas.

228
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,750
So what's the common way for most people to watch these boxing matches?

229
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:01,309
Right.

230
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,990
So in the United States, there's something very popular called pay-per-view.

231
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:07,470
And I'm sure in your countries you have something similar.

232
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:14,409
Basically, pay-per-view, you can buy the fight so you can have access to it and watch it on your TV.

233
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,649
But you only pay one time to watch like maybe two hours, right?

234
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,029
Right.

235
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,149
So let's say you're at your house, it's six o'clock and the fight begins at eight.

236
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:34,289
So you can call your TV cable company or maybe use on the Internet with a credit card and they activate it on your TV so you can watch the fight.

237
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:36,450
And when it's over, well, you finished watching it.

238
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,129
Now, it's pretty expensive, isn't it?

239
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:38,450
Yeah.

240
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:47,610
Pay-per-view can be very expensive depending on what event it is, because sometimes it's boxing matches, concerts or special events.

241
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,490
So it can maybe cost, I don't know, 60, 80, maybe $100.

242
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,909
So it's very popular for one house to buy the pay-per-view.

243
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,929
And then many friends come over and everyone chips in with $5 or $10 and everyone watches it on one TV.

244
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:02,529
All right.

245
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:07,769
So the pay-per-view boxing party, a common way to watch the sport in America.

246
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:08,730
Exactly.

247
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,570

Or former boxers?

252
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:19,850
