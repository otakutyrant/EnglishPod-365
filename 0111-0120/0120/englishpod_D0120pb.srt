00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back to EnglishPod.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And my name is Erica.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today we're bringing you another one of our sports lessons and this time we're going to go to a boxing match.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we're going to be learning a language that you can use if you're talking about boxing, but not only boxing, right?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We can also use this language for describing a fight or somebody that's fighting.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So not that we're asking our listeners to get into fights, but if ever you see a fight, at least now you'll have the language to talk about it.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Exactly.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So let's listen to a dialogue for the first time.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It might sound familiar.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We have the legendary Rocky Balboa at EnglishPod fighting for the heavyweight championship.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So let's see what happens.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Welcome back boxing fans.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man with the modern jaw, Bob Copeland.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you, Rick.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel and Casino where the world heavyweight championship is about to get underway.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's right, Bob.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We're about to witness the legendary Italian Stallion himself, Rocky Balboa square off against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Both fighters are in the ring and we are about to begin.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In the blue corner, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world, the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:04,000
In the red corner, weighing 218 pounds and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts, the undefeated undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's the bell and this fight is underway.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Rocky dodges successfully and counter attacks with a strong right hook.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Apollo is caught.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is his chance.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Apollo is getting pounded.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Apollo recovers with a powerful hay maker and catches Rocky off guard.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He's down.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The ref starts the count.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
One, two, three, four, five.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wow, sounds like a great fight.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Amazing fight and I don't know who's going to win.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Rocky apparently got knocked down.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What do you think will happen?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, if I know anything about Rocky Balboa, he will not stay knocked down for long.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
All right, so let's take a look at some of the language we saw in this dialogue in Language Takeaway.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Language Takeaway.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, Rick Field said that we have a very gruesome match tonight.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A gruesome match.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Gruesome.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All right, so if something is gruesome.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's really, it's bad, it's terrible, it's bloody.

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Okay, bloody, terrible, very hard or like gruesome fight would be a very bloody fight.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, or a gruesome film.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, very good.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So gruesome.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now, they mentioned that both fighters are in the ring.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Both fighters are in the ring.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The ring.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay, so the ring is the physical space where they fight.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But isn't it square?

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah, it is square.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not really circular, but it's called a boxing ring.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not really sure why.

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, maybe one of our listeners knows and can tell us about that because I am not an expert on boxing.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But what I do know is our next word.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They were describing Rocky Balboa's career and they said he had 37 knockouts.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, a knockout.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A knockout.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In this sense, knockout is a noun.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A knockout is when the fighter hits the other fighter and he falls to the ground and he can't get up in 10 seconds because he's tired, he's dizzy, he's hurt.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, so that's a knockout.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay, so this is a technical boxing word.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's the action of falling to the ground and not getting up.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Right, but there's also a verb.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To knock out.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Or to knock someone out.

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Exactly.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So when you say, I knocked this guy out.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It means I hit him so hard that he fell to the floor and maybe he was unconscious for a while.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So he fell asleep basically.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Almost.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So it's very similar, the noun form to the verb form.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like basically if you knock someone out, you get a knockout.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, so to knock someone out, a knockout.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Alright, now for our next word we saw as Apollo quickly began to jab Rocky Balboa.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So the noun, a jab.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So a jab.

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Quick jabs.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So a jab is a kind of punch, right?

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a fast, short, but not very strong punch.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, so a technical boxing word.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A jab.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
A jab.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This can also be a verb, right?

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Right, so to jab.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To jab.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Now Apollo was throwing jabs and Rocky began to dodge.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Alright, and that's our next word.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
To dodge.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Dodge.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
D-O-D-G-E.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
To dodge.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Alright, so if you dodge, you're trying to avoid getting hit.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Right, so you move your body so that you're not hit.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Exactly.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now we can also use it in different ways.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Not only do you dodge when somebody is trying to punch you, you can also, for example, dodge a bullet.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Right, so when you dodge a bullet, you avoid some bad situation or some bad event.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Right, so we have many examples of dodge used in other contexts, so why don't we listen to some examples.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Example one.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
See that guy dodging through the traffic?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's going to get hit by a car if he's not careful.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Example two.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, the storm turned south, so it looks like we managed to dodge a bullet.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Example three.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Look, you're the one who is in charge of sales and the numbers are down.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's your problem, so stop trying to dodge your responsibilities.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You know, that word reminds me of another sport, dodgeball.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, dodgeball, exactly, same principle.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah, that's an entirely different lesson.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think we need to focus here on the boxing vocabulary.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So the announcers said that Apollo is getting pounded.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
To get pounded.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
To get pounded.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now, if someone is getting pounded, they're getting hit really hard and a lot.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So to get pounded.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Get pounded.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And now we have one more word and it's also another boxing term called a haymaker.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
A powerful haymaker.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, so Apollo received a powerful haymaker.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now, this word is actually new to me, so Marco, what does it mean?

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Basically, it's a very strong, very wild punch.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay, so you don't have really good form.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Your body is kind of moving all over the place.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right, so you don't have much balance, so you just throw your entire body and your fist at someone to hit them as hard as you can.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's a haymaker.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
All right, a technical boxing word here for you guys.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But now we've got some interesting phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Fluency Builder.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
All right, so on Fluency Builder today, we're going to take a look at some of these phrases and we have four of them for you today.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So let's get started with the first one.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, the announcer said that the boxing match was about to get underway.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, to get underway.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
To get underway.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So again, this is another way of saying about to begin.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Right.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All right, so we're about to get underway with this new project.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or the meeting's just about to get underway, so make sure everyone's here.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Very good.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So the match was about to get underway and the sports announcer said that Rocky Balboa is going to square off against his lifetime rival.

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So we're going to look at this phrase to square off against someone.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All right, I'm going to square off against Jim.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
All right, when you square off against Jim, you get ready to fight with him or to compete with him, right?

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right, so we're about to have a one-to-one competition.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So this is like a sports word, but it's also really commonly used in a lot of different contexts.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So why don't we hear a few more examples of how we can use this phrase to square off.

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Example one.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The two countries are moving their armies close to the borders as they prepare to square off in a border dispute.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Example two.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Italy and Brazil are squaring off in the final game this afternoon.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Example three.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Lisa and Daniel squared off against each other in the marketing meeting today.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They were both pretty angry.

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
All right, so great examples and I think we can use it now, not only in boxing but in other situations.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now Bob said that Rocky landed a strong blow.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
To land a strong blow.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All right, so land a strong blow.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Now let's break this down.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So a blow.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A blow is a punch or a hit.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, and when you land a strong blow, what happens?

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You basically successfully hit your opponent with a punch or hit.

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So you hit them, so your fist meets their body.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes, so your fist landed on their body.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So I could also change this a little bit.

176
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I could say, I landed a punch.

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Right, or in boxing terms, he landed a strong left jab.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, so to land a blow.

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The announcer described it as Rock threw a left.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
To throw a left.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So he said he threw a left and right.

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Now again, we'll take this one apart.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So a left.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What are we talking about?

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Basically a left punch, but we can omit punch.

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Okay, so it's a punch with your left hand, but the verb throw.

187
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You throw a left punch.

188
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So basically you punch somebody with your left.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay, so it's just another way of saying to punch someone.

190
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
To punch someone, right.

191
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So Bob started to throw some punches at the other guy.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
All right, or look over there, that guy's throwing punches.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
All right, so to throw a left, to throw a punch.

194
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now again, you can use this in a lot of different ways with a lot of different types of punches.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So you could say to throw a jab.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay, or throw an uppercut.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Or throw a hook.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay, so now that we've seen all these phrases, why don't we listen to the dialogue for the very last time and we'll come back in a little bit.

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Welcome back, boxing fans.

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My name is Rick Fields and here with me is the man with the iron jaw, Bob Copeland.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thank you, Rick.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We're coming to you live from Las Vegas.

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We're in the beautiful MGM Grand Hotel and Casino where the World Heavyweight Championship is about to get underway.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right, Bob.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We're about to witness the legendary Italian Stallion himself, Rocky Balboa, square off against his lifetime rival, Apollo Creed.

206
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This will be a gruesome match for sure.

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Both fighters are in the ring and we are about to begin.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:05,000
In the blue corner, weighing in at 220 pounds, the former heavyweight champion of the world, the master of disaster, the one and only Apollo Creed.

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:26,000
In the red corner, weighing 218 pounds and with a record of 47 wins and 37 knockouts, the undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, the Italian Stallion, Rocky Balboa.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There's the bell and this fight is underway.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Apollo quickly attacks Rocky with quick, strong jabs.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Rocky dodges successfully and counter attacks with a strong right hook.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Apollo is cut.

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Rocky landed a strong blow to his right eyebrow and cut him.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This is his chance.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Rocky quickly throws a left, right, another left.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Apollo is getting pounded.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Apollo recovers with a powerful haymaker and catches Rocky off guard.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He's down.

220
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The ref starts the count.

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So as I mentioned, Marco, I'm not really that much of a fan or that knowledgeable about boxing.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And actually, this is becoming a theme in any sports lesson, isn't it?

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, boxing is a very popular sport in North America.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm not really that big of a fan, but I have seen a couple of matches and it's very interesting because as we saw in our dialogue, most big fights take place in Las Vegas at some big hotel.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Right.

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But you said it's super popular and everyone wants to watch these these matches and obviously everyone can't go to Las Vegas.

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So what's the common way for most people to watch these boxing matches?

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Right.

230
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So in the United States, there's something very popular called pay-per-view.

231
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And I'm sure in your countries you have something similar.

232
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Basically, pay-per-view, you can buy the fight so you can have access to it and watch it on your TV.

233
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But you only pay one time to watch like maybe two hours, right?

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Right.

235
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So let's say you're at your house, it's six o'clock and the fight begins at eight.

236
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:34,000
So you can call your TV cable company or maybe use on the Internet with a credit card and they activate it on your TV so you can watch the fight.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And when it's over, well, you finished watching it.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Now, it's pretty expensive, isn't it?

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah.

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Pay-per-view can be very expensive depending on what event it is, because sometimes it's boxing matches, concerts or special events.

241
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So it can maybe cost, I don't know, 60, 80, maybe $100.

242
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
So it's very popular for one house to buy the pay-per-view.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And then many friends come over and everyone chips in with $5 or $10 and everyone watches it on one TV.

244
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,000
All right.

245
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So the pay-per-view boxing party, a common way to watch the sport in America.

246
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Exactly.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000

251
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Or former boxers?

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,000
