00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:10,560
EnglishPod.com Jim, what's up, man?

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,720
Charlie, is that your ride?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,800
It's butt ugly, dude.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,140
Don't be an airhead.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,899
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:21,780
I just need to fix it up a bit.

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,140
In a couple of months, this baby is gonna be wicked.

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:25,760
Not even.

9
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:26,800
Check it out.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,760
Now that's a fresh ride.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,300
Too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

12
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,200
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,420
He's coming this way.

14
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:35,939
Be cool.

15
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:41,460
Hey, guys.

16
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,899
What do you think of my automobile?

17
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,460
Isn't it bad to the bone?

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:44,859
Word.

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,960
The ladies are gonna be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

20
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,280
You really think so?

21
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,000
For sure.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,000
Awesome.

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Psych.

24
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,060
You totally fell for it.

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,820
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,359
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

27
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:02,840
Dude, don't have a cow.
