00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Jim, what's up, man?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Charlie, is that your ride?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's butt ugly, dude.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Don't be an airhead.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I just need to fix it up a bit.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In a couple of months, this baby is gonna be wicked.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Not even.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Check it out.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now that's a fresh ride.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He's coming this way.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Be cool.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey, guys.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What do you think of my automobile?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Isn't it bad to the bone?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Word.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The ladies are gonna be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You really think so?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
For sure.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Awesome.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Psych.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You totally fell for it.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Dude, don't have a cow.
