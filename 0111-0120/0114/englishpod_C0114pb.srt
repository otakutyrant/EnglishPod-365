00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,879
Hello English nerds, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,639
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,759
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,599
And today we're going to be looking at English slang and informal words used in the 1980s.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,199
So this is the next part of our decades dialogues.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,980
Exactly.

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:31,760
So the 1980s maybe for many of our listeners is a little bit more familiar and there are a lot of phrases and a lot of words that were born in this decade and we still use them today.

8
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,100
So we're going to learn those words and phrases in this dialogue.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,579
But before we start, we need to preview a couple of words.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,579
Let's go now to vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:42,859
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,219
So one of the words that we're going to hear in our dialogue is ride.

13
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:48,960
Is that your ride?

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,700
Is that your ride?

15
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:51,799
So a ride.

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,060
Normally, we know this word as a verb, right?

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:55,399
Right.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,840
To ride a bicycle.

19
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,700
In this context, it's an informal way of referring to your car.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,700
So a ride is a car.

21
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:04,040
Yeah.

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,219
So I just bought a new ride.

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:06,799
All right.

24
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:09,540
Well, maybe you'll take me for a ride in your new ride.

25
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,299
In your new ride.

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:10,659
Yeah.

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,260
All right.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,920
And we're also going to be looking at this word loaded.

29
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,099
He's loaded.

30
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,780
So if you are loaded.

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,180
You're really rich.

32
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,640
You have a lot of money.

33
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:22,980
You are loaded with money.

34
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,200
So loaded and ride.

35
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,959
Those are two words for vocabulary preview.

36
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:33,140
And well, let's listen to our 1980s dialogue and see what happens.

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,920
Jim, what's up, man?

38
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,120
Charlie, is that your ride?

39
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,140
It's butt ugly, dude.

40
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,500
Don't be an airhead.

41
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:52,239
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

42
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,140
I just need to fix it up a bit.

43
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,480
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,079
Not even.

45
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,120
Check it out.

46
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,079
Now that's a fresh ride.

47
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,599
Too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

48
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,560
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

49
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,760
He's coming this way.

50
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,300
Be cool.

51
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,780
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,240
What do you think of my automobile?

53
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,800
Isn't it bad to the bone?

54
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,280
Word.

55
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,300
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

56
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,620
You really think so?

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,319
For sure.

58
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,340
Awesome.

59
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,539
Psych.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,419
You totally fell for it.

61
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,139
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

62
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,680
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

63
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,199
Dude, don't have a cow.

64
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,439
All right, so typical high school students of the decade, right?

65
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,979
Definitely very, very 80s.

66
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:46,960
Very 80s.

67
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:54,639
And well, of course, you always have the situation with the cool kids and maybe the kids that are not so cool and they're making fun of him, right?

68
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,360
Yeah, but they use some really cool words, so let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,099
Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,360
All right, so the first word that we saw in Language Takeaway and was really interesting, this word, but ugly.

71
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,719
It's but ugly.

72
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,860
That car is but ugly.

73
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,759
So when something is but ugly, it's really ugly, right?

74
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,840
It's very ugly.

75
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,699
It's not just ugly.

76
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,759
It's very ugly.

77
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,759
But is like...

78
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,060
From your...

79
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,520
Your bottom.

80
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,580
From your bottom, yeah.

81
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:30,580
So he said the car was but ugly and the other guy answered by saying, hey, don't be an airhead.

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,620
An airhead.

83
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,439
Don't be an airhead.

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,539
So an airhead is someone with air in their head.

85
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,539
So they're not very smart.

86
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,479
They've got no brain.

87
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:41,819
They've got no brain, right?

88
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,639
So he said, don't be an airhead.

89
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,219
Don't be such an idiot.

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,099
All right.

91
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,180
Now, for the third word, he described his car as being wicked.

92
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,780
It's wicked.

93
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,020
Wicked.

94
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,780
That's wicked.

95
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:56,719
It's going to be wicked.

96
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,939
Okay, so this is a very 80s way of saying it's going to be cool.

97
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,259
Yeah.

98
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,520
It's going to be awesome.

99
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:03,919
It's going to be wicked.

100
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,819
All right.

101
00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:11,500
And now when they saw another car pulling up, a new car, he described it as a fresh ride.

102
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,020
It's a fresh ride.

103
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,520
Now, we understand that ride is a car, right?

104
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,240
So a fresh ride.

105
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,980
It's another way of saying cool.

106
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,939
Okay, so kind of similar, wicked and fresh.

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,560
Now, finally, at the end of our dialogue, they said, you're a real scumbag, Charlie.

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,879
So this word scumbag is interesting.

109
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,259
You're a scumbag.

110
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,399
A scumbag.

111
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,279
Yeah, it's interesting and it's still used today, I would say.

112
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,540
So when someone is a scumbag, they're just really not a nice person.

113
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,319
Yeah, they're not nice or they're not, maybe to a certain point, honest.

114
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,420
They're not kind.

115
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,740
You're a scumbag.

116
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,699
Okay, but it's not a very harsh word, right?

117
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:53,120
It's not harsh to call somebody a scumbag?

118
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,860
Well, it's not like a swear word, but it's certainly not a nice thing to say to someone.

119
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:58,019
Okay, exactly.

120
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:07,160
All right, so let's listen to all these adjectives that we've just looked at right now, again, in our dialogue, and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

121
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,519
Charlie, is that your ride?

122
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:19,800
It's butt ugly, dude.

123
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,279
Don't be an airhead.

124
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:25,920
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

125
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,100
I just need to fix it up a bit.

126
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,579
In a couple of months, this baby's going to be wicked.

127
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,600
Not even.

128
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:34,860
Check it out.

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,839
Now that's a fresh ride.

130
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,019
Too bad the driver is a major dweeb.

131
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:44,220
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

132
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,720
He's coming this way.

133
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,639
Be cool.

134
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,959
Hey guys, what do you think of my automobile?

135
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,680
Isn't it bad to the bone?

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,240
Word.

137
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,459
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,800
You really think so?

139
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,720
For sure.

140
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:58,699
Awesome.

141
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,060
Psych.

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,180
You totally fell for it.

143
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,420
You are a real scumbag, Charlie.

144
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,300
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

145
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,319
Dude, don't have a cow.

146
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:14,819
Okay, well, you know what Marco?

147
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,339
I love the 80s.

148
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,720
I love the language of the 80s.

149
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,980
I love the music of the 80s.

150
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,480
And I'm really loving these phrases from the 80s.

151
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,439
So why don't we look at them now in Fluency Builder.

152
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,480
Fluency Builder Alright, so on Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at these phrases that you were talking about.

153
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,699
And the first one is very interesting.

154
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:42,959
So these two guys that were making fun of this other person that was in this nice car, and he called him a major dweeb.

155
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:43,899
A major dweeb.

156
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,899
He's a major dweeb.

157
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,300
What a major dweeb.

158
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,860
Now let's break this into two parts first.

159
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,279
Well, let's see what dweeb means.

160
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,339
Well, a dweeb is a very uncool person.

161
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,540
Okay, so kind of similar to a nerd.

162
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,319
Yeah, a small kind of guy with no power.

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,060
Okay, he's a dweeb.

164
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,980
Now, this word major.

165
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,939
It just means big, really serious.

166
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,220
So it's a way of emphasizing, right?

167
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,779
Yeah, and you can say anything, you can have a major anything.

168
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,120
Like, I've got a major headache.

169
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,800
Or I can say, I have a major problem this week.

170
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,459
Okay, so major, a very big problem.

171
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:29,040
Now they're talking about this really cool car, and the guy who is a bit of a dweeb, he said, isn't it bad to the bone?

172
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:30,660
Bad to the bone.

173
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,920
It's bad to the bone.

174
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,639
Alright, now, this is also part of a famous song, Bad to the Bone, but what does it mean?

175
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:41,100
Well, when something is bad to the bone, it's super cool.

176
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:44,019
It's like, it's so dangerous that it's cool.

177
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,300
Exactly, it's very, very cool.

178
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:47,759
It's bad to the bone.

179
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, this is not used anymore.

180
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,220
No, no, no, don't walk out of your house and use this phrase tomorrow.

181
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:59,620
Alright, so, but it's interesting to know because there is a famous song that has this phrase in it.

182
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,079
So, bad to the bone.

183
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:08,860
Alright, so the car was so cool, it was bad to the bone that all of the ladies would be wanting to get with the driver.

184
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,300
Alright, so somebody wants to get with you.

185
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,000
He just wants to get with you.

186
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,480
So if you want to get with someone, you want to have sex with them.

187
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,779
Right, so if you want to get with someone, basically it means that you want to have sex with them, but there's another phrase that was used in the dialogue that means pretty much the same thing.

188
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,660
Yeah, to do the nasty.

189
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,439
To do the nasty.

190
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,660
They're doing the nasty.

191
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,440
Okay, now this was a very popular way of saying it in the 80s, it means to have sex as well.

192
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,200
Yeah, but this one is a little bit rude, isn't it?

193
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,059
Yeah, I think it's a little bit more direct.

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:51,539
If you and your friends are talking and you say, hey, I think that girl wants to get with you, it's a little bit more casual and less obvious.

195
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,259
Yeah, yes, do the nasty is a little bit more, a little more rude.

196
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,620
Yeah, a little bit more direct.

197
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,620
And now the last phrase that we're going to look at today was made famous by the cartoons, The Simpsons.

198
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,759
And it's don't have a cow.

199
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,039
Don't have a cow, man.

200
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,899
Don't have a cow.

201
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,159
So to not have a cow, don't have a cow means?

202
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,659
To get really angry, to freak out, to get upset.

203
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,379
All right, so now we know that you say don't have a cow, but can I say it and use it in the positive?

204
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,139
Can I say, hey, my boss totally had a cow today in the office?

205
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah, and it means again, so it freaked out, got angry, made a big deal of something.

206
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,159
Okay, he had a cow.

207
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah, so Frank's going to have a cow when he finds out I smashed his car.

208
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,320
Of course Frank is going to have a cow.

209
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,159
How can you smash his car?

210
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,980
All right, but now it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the last time.

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,139
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this decade of the 1980s.

212
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,980
Jim, what's up, man?

213
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,159
Charlie, is that your ride?

214
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,259
It's butt ugly, dude.

215
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,539
Don't be an airhead.

216
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:08,320
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

217
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,220
I just need to fix it up a bit.

218
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,580
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

219
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,179
Not even.

220
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,220
Check it out.

221
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,179
Now that's a fresh ride.

222
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,700
Too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

223
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,659
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

224
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:23,860
He's coming this way.

225
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,340
Be cool.

226
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:29,879
Hey, guys.

227
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:31,320
What do you think of my automobile?

228
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:32,919
Isn't it bad to the bone?

229
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,340
Word.

230
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,419
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

231
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,720
You really think so?

232
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,480
For sure.

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,440
Awesome.

234
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,639
Psych.

235
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:44,519
You totally fell for it.

236
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,240
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

237
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,759
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

238
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,279
Dude, don't have a cow.

239
00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:00,559
Okay, so Marco, when I was listening to the dialogue this time, I heard a really cool word.

240
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,340
They said psych.

241
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,340
Right.

242
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,980
Now, this was a very popular thing during the 80s when you would say to somebody, psych.

243
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:12,279
So this is like saying, just kidding, right?

244
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:12,720
Just kidding, right.

245
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,460
So you would say, oh, Erica, I really like your hat.

246
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:16,460
Oh, thank you.

247
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,019
Psych.

248
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:17,980
That hat is terrible.

249
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:18,659
Oh.

250
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:19,980
Right?

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
So that's how you would use it.

252
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,779
You would give somebody a compliment or you would lie to somebody and then tell them, psych, and then tell them the truth.

253
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,740
Like, oh, that hat is terrible or, oh, I was just kidding.

254
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,279
Okay, so psych.

255
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,639
What a great phrase.

256
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,120
It was very, very popular and when I was in school, we would use it as well.

257
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,879
We would psych each other out.

258
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:41,480
So do we still use this phrase today?

259
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:43,279
I don't think we use it today.

260
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,399
I don't think it's cool anymore.

261
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,779
Well, if you use it, it's kind of like you're joking, right?

262
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,919
Yeah, and I think it would make people laugh.

263
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,419
Like, you know, that's pretty funny.

264
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,200
Yeah, you're joking about how you're a little bit old-fashioned.

265
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:54,720
Exactly.

266
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,159
I'm very sure you would surprise a lot of your native English-speaking friends if you use this phrase.

267
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,500
A good one to try out.

268
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:08,279
