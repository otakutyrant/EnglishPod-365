00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English nerds, welcome back to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And today we're going to be looking at English slang and informal words used in the 1980s.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this is the next part of our decades dialogues.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the 1980s maybe for many of our listeners is a little bit more familiar and there are a lot of phrases and a lot of words that were born in this decade and we still use them today.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we're going to learn those words and phrases in this dialogue.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But before we start, we need to preview a couple of words.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's go now to vocabulary preview.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Vocabulary preview.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So one of the words that we're going to hear in our dialogue is ride.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is that your ride?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is that your ride?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So a ride.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Normally, we know this word as a verb, right?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Right.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
To ride a bicycle.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this context, it's an informal way of referring to your car.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So a ride is a car.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I just bought a new ride.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
All right.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, maybe you'll take me for a ride in your new ride.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In your new ride.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
All right.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And we're also going to be looking at this word loaded.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He's loaded.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So if you are loaded.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're really rich.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You have a lot of money.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You are loaded with money.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So loaded and ride.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Those are two words for vocabulary preview.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And well, let's listen to our 1980s dialogue and see what happens.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Jim, what's up, man?

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Charlie, is that your ride?

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's butt ugly, dude.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't be an airhead.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just need to fix it up a bit.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Not even.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Check it out.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now that's a fresh ride.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's coming this way.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Be cool.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey, guys.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What do you think of my automobile?

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Isn't it bad to the bone?

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Word.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You really think so?

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
For sure.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Awesome.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Psych.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You totally fell for it.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Dude, don't have a cow.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, so typical high school students of the decade, right?

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Definitely very, very 80s.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Very 80s.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And well, of course, you always have the situation with the cool kids and maybe the kids that are not so cool and they're making fun of him, right?

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, but they use some really cool words, so let's look at them now in Language Takeaway.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Language Takeaway.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
All right, so the first word that we saw in Language Takeaway and was really interesting, this word, but ugly.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's but ugly.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That car is but ugly.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So when something is but ugly, it's really ugly, right?

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's very ugly.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's not just ugly.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's very ugly.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But is like...

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
From your...

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Your bottom.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
From your bottom, yeah.

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So he said the car was but ugly and the other guy answered by saying, hey, don't be an airhead.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
An airhead.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't be an airhead.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So an airhead is someone with air in their head.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So they're not very smart.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They've got no brain.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They've got no brain, right?

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So he said, don't be an airhead.

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't be such an idiot.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, for the third word, he described his car as being wicked.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's wicked.

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wicked.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's wicked.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's going to be wicked.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, so this is a very 80s way of saying it's going to be cool.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's going to be awesome.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's going to be wicked.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,000
All right.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And now when they saw another car pulling up, a new car, he described it as a fresh ride.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a fresh ride.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now, we understand that ride is a car, right?

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So a fresh ride.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's another way of saying cool.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, so kind of similar, wicked and fresh.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, finally, at the end of our dialogue, they said, you're a real scumbag, Charlie.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So this word scumbag is interesting.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a scumbag.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A scumbag.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, it's interesting and it's still used today, I would say.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So when someone is a scumbag, they're just really not a nice person.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, they're not nice or they're not, maybe to a certain point, honest.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They're not kind.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're a scumbag.

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, but it's not a very harsh word, right?

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's not harsh to call somebody a scumbag?

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Well, it's not like a swear word, but it's certainly not a nice thing to say to someone.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay, exactly.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
All right, so let's listen to all these adjectives that we've just looked at right now, again, in our dialogue, and then we'll come back and look at some more phrases.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Charlie, is that your ride?

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's butt ugly, dude.

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't be an airhead.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I just need to fix it up a bit.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
In a couple of months, this baby's going to be wicked.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Not even.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Check it out.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now that's a fresh ride.

130
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Too bad the driver is a major dweeb.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's coming this way.

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Be cool.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hey guys, what do you think of my automobile?

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Isn't it bad to the bone?

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Word.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You really think so?

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
For sure.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Awesome.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Psych.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You totally fell for it.

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You are a real scumbag, Charlie.

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Dude, don't have a cow.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, well, you know what Marco?

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I love the 80s.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I love the language of the 80s.

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I love the music of the 80s.

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
And I'm really loving these phrases from the 80s.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So why don't we look at them now in Fluency Builder.

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Fluency Builder Alright, so on Fluency Builder today, let's take a look at these phrases that you were talking about.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And the first one is very interesting.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So these two guys that were making fun of this other person that was in this nice car, and he called him a major dweeb.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,000
A major dweeb.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's a major dweeb.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What a major dweeb.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now let's break this into two parts first.

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, let's see what dweeb means.

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, a dweeb is a very uncool person.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay, so kind of similar to a nerd.

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, a small kind of guy with no power.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay, he's a dweeb.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Now, this word major.

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It just means big, really serious.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So it's a way of emphasizing, right?

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, and you can say anything, you can have a major anything.

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Like, I've got a major headache.

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Or I can say, I have a major problem this week.

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, so major, a very big problem.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now they're talking about this really cool car, and the guy who is a bit of a dweeb, he said, isn't it bad to the bone?

172
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Bad to the bone.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's bad to the bone.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright, now, this is also part of a famous song, Bad to the Bone, but what does it mean?

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, when something is bad to the bone, it's super cool.

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's like, it's so dangerous that it's cool.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Exactly, it's very, very cool.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's bad to the bone.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, this is not used anymore.

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, no, no, don't walk out of your house and use this phrase tomorrow.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Alright, so, but it's interesting to know because there is a famous song that has this phrase in it.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So, bad to the bone.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Alright, so the car was so cool, it was bad to the bone that all of the ladies would be wanting to get with the driver.

184
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Alright, so somebody wants to get with you.

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He just wants to get with you.

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So if you want to get with someone, you want to have sex with them.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Right, so if you want to get with someone, basically it means that you want to have sex with them, but there's another phrase that was used in the dialogue that means pretty much the same thing.

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, to do the nasty.

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To do the nasty.

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They're doing the nasty.

191
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Okay, now this was a very popular way of saying it in the 80s, it means to have sex as well.

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yeah, but this one is a little bit rude, isn't it?

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yeah, I think it's a little bit more direct.

194
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you and your friends are talking and you say, hey, I think that girl wants to get with you, it's a little bit more casual and less obvious.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah, yes, do the nasty is a little bit more, a little more rude.

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, a little bit more direct.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And now the last phrase that we're going to look at today was made famous by the cartoons, The Simpsons.

198
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And it's don't have a cow.

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't have a cow, man.

200
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't have a cow.

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So to not have a cow, don't have a cow means?

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
To get really angry, to freak out, to get upset.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
All right, so now we know that you say don't have a cow, but can I say it and use it in the positive?

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Can I say, hey, my boss totally had a cow today in the office?

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, and it means again, so it freaked out, got angry, made a big deal of something.

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay, he had a cow.

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, so Frank's going to have a cow when he finds out I smashed his car.

208
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Of course Frank is going to have a cow.

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How can you smash his car?

210
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
All right, but now it's time for us to listen to this dialogue for the last time.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this decade of the 1980s.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Jim, what's up, man?

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Charlie, is that your ride?

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's butt ugly, dude.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't be an airhead.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This is a 1969 Chevy Impala.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I just need to fix it up a bit.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
In a couple of months, this baby is going to be wicked.

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Not even.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Check it out.

221
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Now that's a fresh ride.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Too bad the driver's a major dweeb.

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy's loaded like his.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's coming this way.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Be cool.

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hey, guys.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What do you think of my automobile?

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Isn't it bad to the bone?

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Word.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The ladies are going to be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You really think so?

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
For sure.

233
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Awesome.

234
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Psych.

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You totally fell for it.

236
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're a real scumbag, Charlie.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we'll see who has the last laugh.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dude, don't have a cow.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, so Marco, when I was listening to the dialogue this time, I heard a really cool word.

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They said psych.

241
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Right.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now, this was a very popular thing during the 80s when you would say to somebody, psych.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So this is like saying, just kidding, right?

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Just kidding, right.

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So you would say, oh, Erica, I really like your hat.

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, thank you.

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Psych.

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That hat is terrible.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh.

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right?

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So that's how you would use it.

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You would give somebody a compliment or you would lie to somebody and then tell them, psych, and then tell them the truth.

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Like, oh, that hat is terrible or, oh, I was just kidding.

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, so psych.

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What a great phrase.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was very, very popular and when I was in school, we would use it as well.

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We would psych each other out.

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So do we still use this phrase today?

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't think we use it today.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't think it's cool anymore.

261
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, if you use it, it's kind of like you're joking, right?

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, and I think it would make people laugh.

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like, you know, that's pretty funny.

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, you're joking about how you're a little bit old-fashioned.

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Exactly.

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm very sure you would surprise a lot of your native English-speaking friends if you use this phrase.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A good one to try out.

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
