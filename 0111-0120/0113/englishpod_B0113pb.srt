00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another great lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And today we are going to have a lesson that is going to be very useful when you arrive late.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, well we all have arrived late to something and we need a good way of saying sorry and saying why we were late.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So today we're not only going to be looking at vocabulary used to explain why you are late, but also some typical excuses of why people are late.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Right, so some normal reasons for saying why you're late.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, why don't we get started with the dialogue.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Now, we're going to hear five people in the dialogue.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So at the beginning we'll hear the boss and the assistant, and then we'll hear three people who are arriving late.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Where is everyone?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
She said she got tied up with a client.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Sorry I'm late everyone.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, there was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Morning everyone.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Are you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There was a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Guys, this is not acceptable.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10-01, and definitely not 10-20.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All right, let's get started.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So the first thing I want to talk about is our...

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm really sorry everyone.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
All right, so well, good excuses in general, except the last one.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I don't think that's such a good excuse of why you're late, right?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, I don't really think if I was the boss, I would be very happy with this employee.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, I don't think coffee is that important.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But some of the excuses were good and some of the language they used to describe the excuses was really great.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So let's look at that now in Language Takeaway.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Language Takeaway.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All right, on Language Takeaway today, we have four words that we're going to be looking at and well, let's get started with the first one.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So Joe called the office assistant and explained that she will be late because she got tied up with a client.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
To get tied up.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So I got tied up with a client.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, this is a really common reason for being late.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But why don't we listen to some examples to help us understand what it means?

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Example one.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sorry, I'm late, honey, I got tied up at the office.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Example two.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was tied up on the phone all afternoon and didn't get any work done.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Example three.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I got tied up in traffic on the way here.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
All right, so if you get tied up, it means that you get busy with something that you can't avoid.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Right, you're busy with something that's so important, it's like you are tied by a rope to that thing.

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, I got tied up.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry, I got tied up.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yep.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All right, now the first person that arrived to the office will explain that there was a huge traffic jam on the highway.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A traffic jam.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A traffic jam.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A huge traffic jam.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now we understand traffic, right?

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Cars, a lot of cars.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So a jam, it means that it was blocked.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It was stopped.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It was stopped.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There were a lot of cars on the highway and they weren't moving.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So a huge traffic jam is a very, very big stopping of cars.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Now our next word explains why sometimes there is a traffic jam.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, we found out that there was a huge pileup.

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
A pileup.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A huge pileup.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, a huge pileup.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now a pileup is another way of saying an accident, right?

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, an accident with many cars and they all get piled on top of each other.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All right, so many cars got into an accident.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yep.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So this could be a reason of why there was a traffic jam.

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And also a reason for why you were late.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now the other person, Scott, also called and he said that he's running late.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He's running late.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He's running late.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm running late.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Now if I'm running late, am I actually running somewhere?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What am I doing?

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's happening?

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are going to be late and you know you're going to be late.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, I know I'm going to be late.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So I'll call you and I'll say, hey, I'm running a little bit late.

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, actually this is the most common thing I say when I'm going to be late.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I think it's really important to know how to use this phrase.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So let's hear some more examples.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Example one.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Jane is running late.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
She'll be here in 10 minutes.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Example two.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Traffic is really bad, so I'm running late.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Example three.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm running a bit late, so please start without me.

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right, perfect.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So running late.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
A very common way of explaining that you're going to be late and, well, it makes you sound very native.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, it's a great phrase.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now our last phrase that we heard, the reason why Scott was running late was because his last meeting ran over.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, to run over.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
My meeting ran over.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Now ran over, my meeting ran over.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It means it went too far?

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, when something runs over, it goes longer.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, longer than expected.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So a meeting can run over or an appointment can run over.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I can say, my meeting ran over 15 minutes, I'm going to be a little bit late.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's right.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A great excuse.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Very good.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Five great words and, well, I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue and understand these words as they were used in the dialogue and then we'll come back and take a look at more phrases.

114
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thanks.

115
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Where is everyone?

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She said she got tied up with a client.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Morning, everyone.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Were you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There was a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Guys, this is not acceptable.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10-01, and definitely not 10-20.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
All right, let's get started.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So the first thing I want to talk about is our- I'm really sorry, everyone.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way too long.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Okay, we got some more great phrases for describing being late.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Fluency Builder.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
When Joe called, she said she'd be there in a sec.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll be here in a sec.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll be here in a sec.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So when someone will be here in a sec, it means they'll be here very soon, right?

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll be here in a sec.

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll be there in a sec.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But what about this word sec?

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a short way of saying second.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So S-E-C.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,000
A sec.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Now it's an exaggeration, obviously, because you won't be there in one second, but you're just explaining that you'll be there very, very soon.

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What about the difference between I'll be here in a sec and I'll be here in a minute?

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, if you say I'll be there in a sec, it means I'll be there in one minute, right?

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But if you say, oh, I'll be there in a minute, it could be a minute or more like three or four or five minutes.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think that's true.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now, again, going back to this traffic issue, we saw that somebody was stuck in traffic.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
To be stuck in traffic.

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I got stuck in traffic.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now when you're stuck in traffic, you can't drive because there are too many cars stopped on the highway.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So you are actually in the traffic.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're stopped there for like 20 minutes.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can't move.

162
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm stuck in traffic.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm going to be late.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Really great excuse.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And the reason they were stuck in traffic was because traffic was backed up for miles.

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Traffic is backed up for miles.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
To be backed up for miles.

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now, if I say the traffic is backed up for miles, it means that it's very long or how does that work?

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, okay.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Imagine there is an accident and that has caused the traffic jam and the cars are lined up for many miles behind you.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Okay.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So it's backed up.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
From that point, there are many miles of cars waiting to pass.

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So it's backed up for miles.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Very good.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So great phrases.

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And I think it's appropriate for us to listen to the dialogue for the very last time.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about this being on time issue.

181
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Where is everyone?

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
She said she got tied up with a client.

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Morning, everyone.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Are you stuck in traffic as well, Jess?

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There was a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Guys, this is not acceptable.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10-01, and definitely not 10-20.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,000
All right.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's get started.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So the first thing I want to talk about is our...

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm really sorry, everyone.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I know I'm late.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But really, it's not my fault.

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, Marco, I know that ideas about time and ideas about being late are different in different countries.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, in different countries, people treat time or being on time in different ways.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, like I'm from Canada and I look at being on time really different than you do, right?

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, because for example, if you call for a meeting at 9 o'clock, usually people will be there at 9 o'clock because the meeting will start...

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In America.

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Right, in America.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now, for example, in Latin America, we do have this, what we call sometimes the Latino time or Hispanic time, which is like 9 o'clock is like the time that everyone should be there, but until people get there, get their coffee and whatever, then it'll be 9.15, maybe up to 9.30.

209
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I think it's a little bit even more noticeable when we're talking about social events, like if you go to someone's house for dinner.

210
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
In Canada, if they say, come to my house at 6 o'clock for dinner, you'll be there at 6.05, right?

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay, yeah.

212
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, usually you'll be there only a couple of minutes after the time that was specified just to give the house owner a little bit of time.

213
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yep.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But if we have a dinner invitation for 6, we know that it's not really going to begin eating at 6, so people will get there at 6.30 or 7.

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And of course, food isn't ready until like maybe 8 or 9.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But in German countries, from what I know, you've got to be there, if they say be there at 6, you're there at 6.00, right?

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Not 6.01.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And also, I think it's about when people start work, right?

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yeah.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How on time you have to begin work.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Sometimes it's acceptable to be 10 or 15 minutes so-called late, but in other places, you know.

222
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yeah, North America, if you're supposed to start work at 9, you have to be at your desk working at 9.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
At 9.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah, see that?

226
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In other countries, people get there at 9, get their coffee, maybe take a quick glance at their emails or the newspaper, and then start working at around 9.30 or 10.

227
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I guess the important thing is to know what the tradition is in the country where you are.

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Exactly.

229
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Exactly.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and let us know how it works in your countries.

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I know that many different countries have a different way of treating time, so share it with us.

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes, and remember, if you have any questions, please ask them at the website as well.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We're out of time today, but until next time, thanks for listening and goodbye.

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Bye-bye.
