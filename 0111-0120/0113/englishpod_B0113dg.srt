EnglishPod.com Where is everyone?

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,320
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,699
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,600
She said she got tied up with a client.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,660
Sorry I'm late everyone.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,300
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,199
Morning everyone.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,980
Were you stuck in traffic as well Jess?

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,660
There was a huge pile up on the highway.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,980
And traffic was backed up for miles.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,600
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:36,219
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,439
Guys, this is not acceptable.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,520
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10-01, and definitely not 10-20.

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,280
Alright, let's get started.

16
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,479
So the first thing I wanted to talk about is our...

17
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,659
I'm really sorry everyone.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,740
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,159
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

20
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,560
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.
