EnglishPod.com Where is everyone?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We were supposed to start 15 minutes ago.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Joe called and said she'd be here in a sec.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
She said she got tied up with a client.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Sorry I'm late everyone.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Morning everyone.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Were you stuck in traffic as well Jess?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There was a huge pile up on the highway.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And traffic was backed up for miles.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Scott just called and said that he's running late.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
His last meeting ran over, but he's on his way now.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Guys, this is not acceptable.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If I say the meeting starts at 10, the meeting starts at 10, not 10-01, and definitely not 10-20.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, let's get started.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So the first thing I wanted to talk about is our...

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm really sorry everyone.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I know I'm late, but really it's not my fault.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I was getting a coffee at Starbucks and the line was way, way too long.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I was waiting for 20 minutes to get my coffee.
