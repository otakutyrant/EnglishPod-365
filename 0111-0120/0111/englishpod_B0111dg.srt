00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,560
Good morning, golf aficionados.

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,099
My name is Rick Fields, and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,119
Thank you, Rick.

5
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:21,660
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach, where the top golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of $1 million.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,359
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,059
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:41,259
All right, we're here at the 8th hole, it's par 4, and it has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
Although I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole-of-one on this very same hole.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
Tiger Woods is about to tee off, and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,100
Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver, and he seems to be very nervous.

12
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,799
Oh, no, not a good swing at all.

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,539
It's definitely not his day today.

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,239
On the 7th hole, he got a bogey, and before that, he barely made par.

15
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,459
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,719
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

17
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,140
He's having a hard time finding it, and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

18
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:19,900
Oh, no, a bear!

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,159
Run, Tiger, run!

20
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,219
Somebody call animal control!
