00:00:02,239 --> 00:00:07,759
Hello English learners, welcome back to another sports lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,580
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,660
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,179
And today we're going to be talking about a very interesting and very difficult game to play and it's golf.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:27,699
So we've got some golf vocabulary for you in this lesson and I think we better actually look at a few vocabulary words in vocabulary preview before we start with the dialogue.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:37,719
VOCABULARY PREVIEW On vocabulary preview today we have three words and the first one is aficionado.

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,299
Aficionado.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,740
An aficionado.

9
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:41,960
A golf aficionado.

10
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:48,420
Alright, so this basically is a very fancy word of, it's a very fancy way of saying a fan.

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,179
Yes, someone who likes something a lot.

12
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:52,659
Okay, so you are an aficionado.

13
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,479
I like golf.

14
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,140
Yeah, you can also be a wine aficionado.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,479
Okay, so it's kind of like a hobby.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,920
Yeah, you know a lot about it and you like it.

17
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,000
And now our second word is not anywhere in the dialogue.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,260
No, but we're going to use it when we explain some of these words so you need to know it.

19
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:11,560
Okay, the word is club.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,560
A golf club.

21
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,799
Okay, so a golf club is the tool you use to hit the golf ball.

22
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,260
Right, so it's a long tube basically that looks like a J kind of.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,159
Yeah, and you hit the ball with it.

24
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,079
So that's a golf club.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,060
And now our third word is golf course.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,920
Golf course.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,480
A golf course.

28
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:35,340
A course.

29
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,260
So this is the area where you play golf.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,980
Yeah, it's like the golf field.

31
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,379
Exactly, so it's a very big green area where you play golf.

32
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,000
So those are the three words we have for vocabulary preview.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,640
So now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time as we listen to our sports announcers, Rick Fields and Bob Copeland, and see what happens on this occasion.

34
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,959
Good morning golf aficionados.

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:10,539
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,560
Thank you, Rick.

37
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:20,860
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of one million dollars.

38
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,780
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

39
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:25,400
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,120
All right, we're here at the eighth hole.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,680
It's par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

42
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,620
Although I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole of one on this very same hole.

43
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,259
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

44
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,139
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

45
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,240
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

46
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,979
It's definitely not his day today.

47
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:05,680
On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

48
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,900
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

49
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,180
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

50
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,740
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

51
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,319
Oh no, a bear!

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,580
Run Tiger, run!

53
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:20,659
Somebody call animal control!

54
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:31,039
So a pretty exciting ending to that dialogue there, a bear on the golf course.

55
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,620
Yeah, I wonder if Tiger is okay.

56
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,900
I sure hope so because it would be a huge loss to the world of golf.

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:45,439
Right, so we did learn a lot about golf because they used some very specific and technical words for golf.

58
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,379
So let's look at these now in Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:51,879 --> 00:04:04,819
Alright, so the announcers were talking about the game and they're talking about the course and they're here on the eighth hole and they said that last time Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one.

60
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,419
Hole in one?

61
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,479
A hole in one.

62
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,219
Okay, a hole in one.

63
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:15,020
So this is when you hit the ball once and the ball goes in the hole.

64
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,459
So it's something very difficult to do.

65
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:18,800
Yes.

66
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,259
Right, a hole in one.

67
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,500
I've certainly never made one.

68
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,240
Okay, so sometimes it's also called an ace.

69
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,939
So it can be a hole in one or called an ace.

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,819
Ah, okay.

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,120
Now for our second word, now once we get to the hole, to the ninth hole or the tenth hole, we have to tee off.

72
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,410
To tee off.

73
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,120
Tee off.

74
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,160
So when you tee off, you begin playing.

75
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,660
Right, so it's the very first instance where you put the little ball on the tee.

76
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,300
And you hit the ball for the first time.

77
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,779
Exactly, so to tee off.

78
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,379
Now another golf vocabulary, they were talking about a caddy.

79
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:02,040
Right, a caddy.

80
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:02,819
A caddy.

81
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,220
Now a caddy is a person.

82
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,819
Yes, it's the person who carries your golf clubs.

83
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:15,199
Exactly, so he carries your bag, your golf clubs, and basically helps you while you're playing golf.

84
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:22,899
Yeah, he tells you which way you should hit the ball and maybe, you know, gives you a nice cold drink and looks after you.

85
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:23,699
Very good.

86
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,920
So that's a caddy.

87
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,000
And now the caddy, since he has to carry all the golf clubs, Tiger Woods asked him for his driver.

88
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:34,100
A driver.

89
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,379
A driver.

90
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:35,939
A driver.

91
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,860
Now a driver is a type of golf club.

92
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,899
Right, it's not a person.

93
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:47,199
No, no, it's a type of golf club and it's a very big and heavy golf club that is used to tee off.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,899
So it's used to hit the ball a very long way.

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,920
Yes, that is called the driver.

96
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:01,259
Okay, so the next thing they were talking about were some different types of scores that you could get on a hole.

97
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,740
And the first one they mentioned was par.

98
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,720
Okay, so you can make par.

99
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,600
Okay, or the par of the course can be four.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,819
Okay, very good.

101
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:20,899
So basically the par is the maximum number of swings or strokes you can make before putting the ball into the hole.

102
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:29,339
Right, so it's like the, right, so when a hole is par four you should only hit the ball four times.

103
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:30,339
Four times or less.

104
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,660
Very good.

105
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,939
Now, if you don't make par, there are some options.

106
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,180
You can make a bogey.

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,579
Alright, a bogey.

108
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,120
A bogey.

109
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:49,579
Now sometimes the golf course is very difficult, so instead of putting the ball in the hole, let's say in four turns, you do it in five.

110
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,920
Okay, so it's one over par.

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,120
One over par.

112
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,839
So that's bad.

113
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,160
Yeah, that's bad because you get a point.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,560
So it's kind of strange because in golf the more points you have, the worse you are.

115
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,160
The worse you are.

116
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,420
So that is a bogey.

117
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,459
Now, they also talked about a birdie.

118
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,839
Birdie is the opposite if you hit one under par.

119
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,779
So that's good.

120
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,220
Yeah, that's good because you have minus one, one less than par.

121
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,759
Alright, so this is actually a lot of weird, crazy, strange language, birdie, bogey, caddie, driver.

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,680
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to help us understand.

123
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,600
One prize of one million dollars.

124
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,839
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

125
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,220
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

126
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,439
Alright, we're here at the eighth hole.

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,060
It's a par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

128
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,540
Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole.

129
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,620
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

130
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:26,899
Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

131
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,040
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,419
It is definitely not his day today.

133
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,399
On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

134
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
He'll definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

135
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,899
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees.

136
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:51,840
He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

137
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Oh no, a bear.

138
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:55,279
Run Tiger, run.

139
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,100
Somebody call animal control.

140
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,440
Alright great, so I think it's clear now what type of rules they have in golf and how it works.

141
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,700
So why don't we take a look now at some of the phrases that we heard in the dialogue in Fluency Builder.

142
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:20,679
Okay, well one of the phrases I want to talk about is something that Bob Copeland said.

143
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,000
He said, as you can see ladies and gentlemen, we're here at beautiful Pebble Beach.

144
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,919
Okay, as you can see.

145
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:29,019
As you can see.

146
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,860
So this usually goes in the beginning of a sentence.

147
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:35,840
Yeah, it's a way to say I know you can see this, I'm telling you something you know.

148
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,860
Okay, so maybe I'm showing you my house and I can say, as you can see our living room is very spacious.

149
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,139
Yes, so this is actually a really helpful phrase.

150
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,980
It can help you sound really native-like, so why don't we hear some examples of how it's used.

151
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,980
As you can see, we recently remodeled our entire kitchen.

152
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:07,039
As you can see here, the damage to the building is very serious.

153
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,059
As you can see, the hairstylist made a mistake when cutting my hair.

154
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,879
Alright, great, so as you can see.

155
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:28,799
Now for our second phrase, well Tiger Woods wasn't doing very well and the announcer said, it's not his day.

156
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:30,100
It's not his day.

157
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,639
It's not his day today.

158
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,039
Alright, so when it's not your day, you're having a bad time or a bad day.

159
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,799
Right, maybe you're having difficulties or you're having bad luck that day.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah, so for example, today I had a headache and I ripped my pants and I spilled coffee on myself.

161
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,320
So it really wasn't my day.

162
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,379
Okay, it's not your day today.

163
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:57,700
No.

164
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,100
Great phrase and also very common and makes you sound very native.

165
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:02,740
That's right.

166
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:11,799
Now, the last phrase, similar to it's not your day, we also heard that Tiger was having a hard time.

167
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,559
Okay, to have a hard time.

168
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,580
To have a hard time.

169
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,740
Now, if you have a hard time with something.

170
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,460
You have difficulty with it.

171
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,059
Okay, now it's not only related to golf, right?

172
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,500
Of course, you can talk about anything like this.

173
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,539
So, I'm having a hard time understanding what this word means.

174
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,840
Okay, or when I was in school I had a hard time with math.

175
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,879
Alright, me too.

176
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,080
So, to have a hard time means that you have difficulties with something.

177
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,659
So, great phrases, great words.

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,899
Let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about golf.

179
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,340
Good morning golf aficionados, my name is Rick Fields and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man.

180
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,299
Bob Copeland.

181
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,299
Thank you, Rick.

182
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:11,399
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of one million dollars.

183
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,559
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

184
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,159
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

185
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:30,460
Alright, we're here at the 8th hole, it's par 4 and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

186
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:34,480
Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole-of-one on this very same hole.

187
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,039
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

188
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,779
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

189
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,960
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

190
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,740
It's definitely not his day today.

191
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,440
On the 7th hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

192
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,639
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

193
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,940
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

194
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,320
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

195
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:09,059
Oh no, a bear!

196
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,360
Run Tiger, run!

197
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,399
Somebody call animal control!

198
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:26,519
Alright, so Marco, I know that in the Western business world golf is actually super important for your career, isn't it?

199
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,919
Well, many times when you see in movies or the stereotype is that business is done on a golf course.

200
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:44,720
And yeah, it is true, many times people will invite you out to a golf course and you'll be playing a game and talking business and relaxing at the same time.

201
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
So maybe you negotiate a deal out on the golf course.

202
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,659
Exactly, and of course if you lose, it's a good thing because then the deal will pull through.

203
00:13:54,159 --> 00:14:00,940
Well actually, I know that it is so important for people who are wanting to do well in business.

204
00:14:01,179 --> 00:14:07,159
And many people who don't speak English as their first language take golf English lessons.

205
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:12,340
Right, so not only golf lessons, like how to play golf, but also in English.

206
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:19,700
Like how to talk about golf, how to talk to other people and make deals while you're on the golf course.

207
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,379
Yeah, because like in many other sports, golf has also its slang and its terms and stuff.

208
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,559
So yeah, it's very interesting and it's one of those cultural things.

209
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,100
That's right.
