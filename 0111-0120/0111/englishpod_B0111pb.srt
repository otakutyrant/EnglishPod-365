00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello English learners, welcome back to another sports lesson with us here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And I'm Erika.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we're going to be talking about a very interesting and very difficult game to play and it's golf.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So we've got some golf vocabulary for you in this lesson and I think we better actually look at a few vocabulary words in vocabulary preview before we start with the dialogue.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
VOCABULARY PREVIEW On vocabulary preview today we have three words and the first one is aficionado.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Aficionado.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
An aficionado.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A golf aficionado.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Alright, so this basically is a very fancy word of, it's a very fancy way of saying a fan.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, someone who likes something a lot.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, so you are an aficionado.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I like golf.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah, you can also be a wine aficionado.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, so it's kind of like a hobby.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, you know a lot about it and you like it.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And now our second word is not anywhere in the dialogue.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, but we're going to use it when we explain some of these words so you need to know it.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, the word is club.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A golf club.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, so a golf club is the tool you use to hit the golf ball.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Right, so it's a long tube basically that looks like a J kind of.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, and you hit the ball with it.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So that's a golf club.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And now our third word is golf course.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Golf course.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A golf course.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
A course.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So this is the area where you play golf.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, it's like the golf field.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Exactly, so it's a very big green area where you play golf.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So those are the three words we have for vocabulary preview.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So now we could listen to our dialogue for the first time as we listen to our sports announcers, Rick Fields and Bob Copeland, and see what happens on this occasion.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Good morning golf aficionados.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My name is Rick Fields and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man, Bob Copeland.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you, Rick.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of one million dollars.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
All right, we're here at the eighth hole.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Although I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole of one on this very same hole.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's definitely not his day today.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh no, a bear!

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Run Tiger, run!

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Somebody call animal control!

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So a pretty exciting ending to that dialogue there, a bear on the golf course.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, I wonder if Tiger is okay.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I sure hope so because it would be a huge loss to the world of golf.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Right, so we did learn a lot about golf because they used some very specific and technical words for golf.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So let's look at these now in Language Takeaway.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, so the announcers were talking about the game and they're talking about the course and they're here on the eighth hole and they said that last time Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hole in one?

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A hole in one.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, a hole in one.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So this is when you hit the ball once and the ball goes in the hole.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So it's something very difficult to do.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right, a hole in one.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've certainly never made one.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay, so sometimes it's also called an ace.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So it can be a hole in one or called an ace.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ah, okay.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now for our second word, now once we get to the hole, to the ninth hole or the tenth hole, we have to tee off.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
To tee off.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Tee off.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So when you tee off, you begin playing.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right, so it's the very first instance where you put the little ball on the tee.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And you hit the ball for the first time.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Exactly, so to tee off.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now another golf vocabulary, they were talking about a caddy.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right, a caddy.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A caddy.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Now a caddy is a person.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, it's the person who carries your golf clubs.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Exactly, so he carries your bag, your golf clubs, and basically helps you while you're playing golf.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah, he tells you which way you should hit the ball and maybe, you know, gives you a nice cold drink and looks after you.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Very good.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So that's a caddy.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And now the caddy, since he has to carry all the golf clubs, Tiger Woods asked him for his driver.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A driver.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A driver.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A driver.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now a driver is a type of golf club.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Right, it's not a person.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No, no, it's a type of golf club and it's a very big and heavy golf club that is used to tee off.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So it's used to hit the ball a very long way.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, that is called the driver.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay, so the next thing they were talking about were some different types of scores that you could get on a hole.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And the first one they mentioned was par.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, so you can make par.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay, or the par of the course can be four.

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, very good.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So basically the par is the maximum number of swings or strokes you can make before putting the ball into the hole.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Right, so it's like the, right, so when a hole is par four you should only hit the ball four times.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Four times or less.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Very good.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, if you don't make par, there are some options.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can make a bogey.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Alright, a bogey.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A bogey.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now sometimes the golf course is very difficult, so instead of putting the ball in the hole, let's say in four turns, you do it in five.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Okay, so it's one over par.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
One over par.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So that's bad.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yeah, that's bad because you get a point.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So it's kind of strange because in golf the more points you have, the worse you are.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The worse you are.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So that is a bogey.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Now, they also talked about a birdie.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Birdie is the opposite if you hit one under par.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So that's good.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah, that's good because you have minus one, one less than par.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Alright, so this is actually a lot of weird, crazy, strange language, birdie, bogey, caddie, driver.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one more time to help us understand.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
One prize of one million dollars.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Alright, we're here at the eighth hole.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a par four and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It is definitely not his day today.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He'll definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh no, a bear.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Run Tiger, run.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Somebody call animal control.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Alright great, so I think it's clear now what type of rules they have in golf and how it works.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So why don't we take a look now at some of the phrases that we heard in the dialogue in Fluency Builder.

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Okay, well one of the phrases I want to talk about is something that Bob Copeland said.

143
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He said, as you can see ladies and gentlemen, we're here at beautiful Pebble Beach.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, as you can see.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
As you can see.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So this usually goes in the beginning of a sentence.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, it's a way to say I know you can see this, I'm telling you something you know.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, so maybe I'm showing you my house and I can say, as you can see our living room is very spacious.

149
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes, so this is actually a really helpful phrase.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It can help you sound really native-like, so why don't we hear some examples of how it's used.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
As you can see, we recently remodeled our entire kitchen.

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
As you can see here, the damage to the building is very serious.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
As you can see, the hairstylist made a mistake when cutting my hair.

154
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Alright, great, so as you can see.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Now for our second phrase, well Tiger Woods wasn't doing very well and the announcer said, it's not his day.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not his day.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's not his day today.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Alright, so when it's not your day, you're having a bad time or a bad day.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Right, maybe you're having difficulties or you're having bad luck that day.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, so for example, today I had a headache and I ripped my pants and I spilled coffee on myself.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So it really wasn't my day.

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay, it's not your day today.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No.

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Great phrase and also very common and makes you sound very native.

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's right.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Now, the last phrase, similar to it's not your day, we also heard that Tiger was having a hard time.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay, to have a hard time.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
To have a hard time.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now, if you have a hard time with something.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You have difficulty with it.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay, now it's not only related to golf, right?

172
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Of course, you can talk about anything like this.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So, I'm having a hard time understanding what this word means.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay, or when I was in school I had a hard time with math.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Alright, me too.

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, to have a hard time means that you have difficulties with something.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So, great phrases, great words.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's listen to this dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and talk a little bit more about golf.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Good morning golf aficionados, my name is Rick Fields and you guessed it, I'm here with my main man.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Bob Copeland.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Thank you, Rick.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:11,000
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are vying to win the grand prize of one million dollars.

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Whoa, that's a lot of cash.

184
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Alright, we're here at the 8th hole, it's par 4 and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid.

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole-of-one on this very same hole.

187
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Tiger Woods is about to tee off and let's see if he has the same luck as Jack.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tiger is asking his caddy for his driver and he seems to be very nervous.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh no, not a good swing at all.

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's definitely not his day today.

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
On the 7th hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.

193
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep into the trees.

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He's having a hard time finding it and even his caddy has climbed a tree to try and spot it.

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh no, a bear!

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Run Tiger, run!

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Somebody call animal control!

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Alright, so Marco, I know that in the Western business world golf is actually super important for your career, isn't it?

199
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Well, many times when you see in movies or the stereotype is that business is done on a golf course.

200
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And yeah, it is true, many times people will invite you out to a golf course and you'll be playing a game and talking business and relaxing at the same time.

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So maybe you negotiate a deal out on the golf course.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Exactly, and of course if you lose, it's a good thing because then the deal will pull through.

203
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well actually, I know that it is so important for people who are wanting to do well in business.

204
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And many people who don't speak English as their first language take golf English lessons.

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Right, so not only golf lessons, like how to play golf, but also in English.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Like how to talk about golf, how to talk to other people and make deals while you're on the golf course.

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah, because like in many other sports, golf has also its slang and its terms and stuff.

208
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So yeah, it's very interesting and it's one of those cultural things.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's right.
