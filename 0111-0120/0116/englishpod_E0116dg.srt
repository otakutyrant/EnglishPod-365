2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
As you know, you missed a fairly significant deadline last week and this will negatively impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I know, I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline, but really, it wasn't my fault.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute and I couldn't get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable, then I wouldn't have missed my deadline.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, come on.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
An excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I know it was me who was ultimately responsible for getting this done, but the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And you know, with everything I've got going on now, I can't afford to waste time dealing with technical problems.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've got a lot on my plate and there are only 24 hours in a day.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not going to accept this excuse.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you've missed your deadline.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No more phony excuses.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you're in over your head, you tell me.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No more missed deadlines.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.
