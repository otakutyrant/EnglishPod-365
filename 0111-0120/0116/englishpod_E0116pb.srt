00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:07,780
Hello English learners, welcome back to another advanced lesson here at EnglishPod.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,539
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,619
And I'm Erica.

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,240
And today we're going to be back in the office.

5
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,160
That's right.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,579
We are listening in as somebody gets a little bit of trouble from their boss for being a bit late on a project.

7
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,160
Alright so we're going to be at the office.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,899
Somebody misses a deadline and so, well, how do you handle the situation?

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:30,300
What can you do to explain yourself?

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,460
And what language can you actually use to talk about missed deadlines and late work?

11
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:42,020
Alright, so let's see why this person missed the deadline and let's find out what happens.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,140
And so I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

13
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:05,959
As you know, you missed a fairly significant deadline last week and this will negatively impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.

14
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,640
I know, I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline but really it wasn't my fault.

15
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:20,439
You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute and I couldn't get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis.

16
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:27,420
You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable then I wouldn't have missed my deadline.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,540
Oh come on, an excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:41,340
You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

19
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:43,579
No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:57,920
I know it was me who was ultimately responsible for getting this done but the thing is I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down and you know, with everything I've got going on now, I can't afford to waste time dealing with technical problems.

21
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,519
I've got a lot on my plate and there are only 24 hours in a day.

22
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,159
I'm not going to accept this excuse.

23
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:10,759
You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you've missed your deadline.

24
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,580
Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards.

25
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,319
No more phony excuses.

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,180
If you're in over your head, you tell me.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,599
No more missed deadlines.

28
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,419
Now I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.

29
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:39,120
Well it sounds like this guy isn't really accepting a lot of the responsibility for his missed deadline.

30
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,159
Exactly.

31
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,159
Well apparently he's explaining that it wasn't only his fault, right?

32
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:53,219
Yep, so some technical problems, but you know, he used a lot of pretty interesting language and I think it'll help us to look at that now in Language Takeaway.

33
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,060
All right, so in Language Takeaway today we have five words and let's start with the first one.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:11,979
All right, well the boss is not really happy with the excuse that the employee was giving and he said an excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

35
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,460
Tantamount?

36
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,659
Tantamount to something.

37
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,879
Okay so if an excuse like that is tantamount to lying, what is he trying to say here?

38
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,180
Basically it's the same as, or it's almost the same as.

39
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,979
So similar to.

40
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,319
So if I say tantamount to something else, how would I use it?

41
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,400
You know Marco, taking my computer without asking is tantamount to stealing.

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Okay so even though I'm not actually stealing it or taking it home with me, it is almost like stealing.

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:48,800
And the interesting grammatical thing here is that we almost always use a gerund right after so tantamount to verb ing.

44
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,639
Okay tantamount to stealing, tantamount to lying, tantamount to killing.

45
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,979
Okay well on that happy note, let's go on to our next word.

46
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,139
Now the boss was really unhappy with the employee for procrastinating.

47
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:04,939
Procrastinating.

48
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,639
Procrastinating.

49
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:08,719
So the verb is to procrastinate.

50
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,319
And when you procrastinate you say, oh I'll do it later, I'll do it tomorrow.

51
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,439
Okay so you kind of delay things or you leave it for another day.

52
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:18,819
Yep.

53
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,220
Alright very good.

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,120
So to procrastinate.

55
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,540
A favorite verb amongst college students.

56
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:31,860
I actually thought for a little while that procrastinate was to have babies.

57
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,420
Oh okay.

58
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:34,100
It's kind of similar.

59
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,939
What's the word?

60
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,740
Procreate.

61
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,339
Procreate.

62
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:41,980
So for a while I always thought that procrastinate was like having babies, like why are you procrastinating?

63
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
And I'm like, I'm not.

64
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,339
Well glad you got that straight.

65
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,019
So yes our listeners, procrastinate is not the same as procreate.

66
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:50,620
Okay.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I learned that the hard way.

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,920
Yes well it sounds like you had a little bit of a glitch in your understanding of language and that's our next phrase.

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,300
So in the dialogue they were talking about some glitches with the system.

70
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,160
A glitch in the system.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,720
Okay so a glitch.

72
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,939
Now this is common among computers right?

73
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,079
A glitch is an error.

74
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:20,540
Right so when you're talking about a glitch and you're talking about computers it's an error or a mistake but we also use it to talk about any unexpected problem.

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,240
A small unexpected problem.

76
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,480
Okay so a small glitch.

77
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,060
Yeah there was a glitch in our plan and we arrived 10 minutes late.

78
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:32,339
Or I can say this movie has a glitch in the story.

79
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,220
So there's a small problem in the story that doesn't make sense.

80
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:44,920
Alright so the employee was blaming his lateness on these small technical glitches but the boss didn't believe this right?

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,439
The boss said you're trying to rationalize the fact that you missed the deadline.

82
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,899
Okay to rationalize.

83
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,300
To rationalize.

84
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,399
So the boss is saying that he's trying to rationalize so that means is he trying to make sense of it?

85
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:17,519
Well this is an interesting psychological word and when you rationalize something you think about it or describe it like especially some bad behavior in a way that makes it seem better or proper or more sensible.

86
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,100
So you're trying to convince yourself.

87
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,060
Yeah you're telling other people but you're also telling yourself that it's better.

88
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,779
Okay or that you're right when you're actually wrong.

89
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:27,259
Yes.

90
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:38,639
Okay so he was trying to rationalize the fact that he missed the deadline so he was trying to explain to the boss and also kind of make himself believe that it wasn't really his fault when it was.

91
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:44,660
Now because this is a little bit of a difficult concept to understand I think we should hear some examples.

92
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,160
Example one.

93
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,399
You can't rationalize your son's behavior by saying he's going through a hard time.

94
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:54,220
Example two.

95
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,920
As much as I tried I couldn't rationalize buying such an expensive pair of shoes.

96
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:02,980
Example three.

97
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,519
You know it was the wrong thing to do.

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,220
Stop trying to rationalize it.

99
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,040
Okay so clear as daylight now this word rationalize.

100
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:23,000
Alright in our final words so the boss really wasn't happy with these excuses and he said no more phony excuses.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,099
Okay phony.

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,079
P-H-O-N-Y phony.

103
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,399
So phony is basically false or fake.

104
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,399
Right so a phony statement.

105
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:35,139
A phony watch.

106
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:36,540
Okay a fake watch.

107
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,379
Yeah not a Sony watch but a phony watch.

108
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,019
A phony.

109
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:51,860
So a lot of great words in this dialogue but as you mentioned we also saw some very interesting phrases that we can use in situations like this so why don't we start now with Fluency Builder.

110
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,660
Fluency Builder.

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:14,100
Well you know one of the interesting things about English is that we have a lot of ways to make things sound more direct less direct harder or softer and in this dialogue there are a few examples of how we use softening words to but just to do the opposite to actually make it a little strong.

112
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,639
Okay so why don't we start with the first paragraph in the first part of the dialogue he said you missed a fairly significant deadline.

113
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,779
A fairly significant deadline.

114
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,180
Now this word fairly.

115
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,459
Kind of.

116
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,139
Sort of.

117
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,980
So it's not very significant it's kind of significant.

118
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,179
But in this context when the person is saying it it just sounds a little bit softer but your understanding is.

119
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,240
It's a very important deadline.

120
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,379
Okay a very important deadline.

121
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:50,240
So another similar example of this is the boss was saying you're essentially blaming the tech team.

122
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,340
Okay you're essentially blaming.

123
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,720
So essentially is like basically or pretty much.

124
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,440
So it sounds a little softer but what he's actually really saying is you're doing this.

125
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:02,919
Right.

126
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,360
So instead of saying you're blaming the tech team he adds this word essentially to kind of say well basically you're saying it's their fault.

127
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:10,740
Yeah.

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,279
But the context or you understand that it's actually very direct and he's saying it's your fault.

129
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,059
Yeah so he's saying you're almost blaming the tech team but what he means is you're blaming the tech team.

130
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,480
Now our third phrase is very interesting because it's kind of like a saying.

131
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,059
That's right.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,620
So the employee says I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

133
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,940
I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

134
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm not trying to pass the buck.

135
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,820
Now what's the buck.

136
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:37,879
A dollar bill.

137
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,120
A dollar bill.

138
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:45,860
So he's well I understand that he's saying I'm not trying to blame somebody else or pass the blame onto someone else.

139
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,100
But you can think about it like this like imagine he had some fake or phony money right.

140
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,860
And he wants to pass that on to the next person so he doesn't get in trouble.

141
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,620
OK.

142
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,240
So I'm not trying to pass the buck.

143
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,799
I'm not trying to pass the blame put the responsibility on someone else.

144
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,720
Very good.

145
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,759
But you know what you know what he really means here.

146
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,039
What.

147
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,580
I am trying to do that because he knew.

148
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:08,940
Yeah.

149
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,940
He knew that it was a fake dollar bill.

150
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,340
Yeah.

151
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:11,840
Yeah.

152
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:17,519
Now the fourth one is interesting as well because it's kind of like a metaphor.

153
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:24,019
He said the boss said you're using the small technical glitches as a crutch.

154
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,279
So using something as a crutch.

155
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:28,559
Now the crutch is a.

156
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,600
You know when you when you break your leg you use those wooden or metal sticks to walk with.

157
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,679
OK to help you walk.

158
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:35,940
Yeah.

159
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:44,240
So the boss is basically saying you're using these technical glitches as an excuse or as an aid to why you missed the deadline.

160
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:44,860
Yeah.

161
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,299
So if you think about it like this some people might say OK if you walk with a crutch then you you won't succeed.

162
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:51,799
Right.

163
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,879
Because whatever.

164
00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:04,820
So this guy this employee is basically saying yes I know that I should meet deadlines but these these problems these glitches are like my crutch that make me not succeed.

165
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,480
OK.

166
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,559
So he's trying to just make excuses.

167
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:08,100
Mm hmm.

168
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,620
So God Marco that was a little bit difficult to understand.

169
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,440
Do you think we should give a couple more examples.

170
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,480
Yeah I think I think some more examples would be very useful so let's listen to a couple of them now.

171
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:21,740
Example one.

172
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,740
I realized that I was using alcohol as a crutch to get through the day.

173
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,220
Example two.

174
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,019
I think Bill's very capable of being successful but he uses his disability as a crutch.

175
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,320
Example three.

176
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,220
Stop using your weight as a crutch.

177
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,899
Just because you're a bit fat doesn't mean you can't get a great job.

178
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:48,779
All right.

179
00:11:49,120 --> 00:12:00,879
So a lot of great phrases great words and well I think it's time for us to listen to about this aspect of meeting deadlines.

180
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,340
And so I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project.

181
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:22,139
As you know you missed a fairly significant deadline last week and this will negatively impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.

182
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,860
I know I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline but really it wasn't my fault.

183
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:36,639
You see we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute and I couldn't get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis.

184
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:43,620
You know if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable then I wouldn't have missed my deadline.

185
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,139
Oh come on.

186
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,759
An excuse like that is tantamount to lying.

187
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:57,620
You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.

188
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,779
No I'm not trying to pass the buck here.

189
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,419
I know it was me who was ultimately responsible for getting this done.

190
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,379
But the thing is I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down.

191
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,139
And you know with everything I've got going on now I can't afford to waste time dealing with technical problems.

192
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,700
I've got a lot on my plate and there are only 24 hours in a day.

193
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,379
I'm not going to accept this excuse.

194
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:27,000
You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you've missed your deadline.

195
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,779
Look we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards.

196
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,539
No more phony excuses.

197
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,840
If you're in over your head you tell me no more missed deadlines.

198
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,659
Now I want that data on my desk by 9 a.m.

199
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:50,519
This employee got in a lot of trouble for missing his deadline.

200
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,299
Exactly.

201
00:13:51,559 --> 00:14:00,940
I think it's a very important aspect of not only Western culture but also in general assuming guilt when it's your fault.

202
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:01,279
Yeah.

203
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,759
In this case we saw that the employee didn't really want to accept the fact that it was his fault.

204
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,120
Yeah he didn't say yeah I know it was me I'm sorry and this is my plan to fix it.

205
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:20,139
Now this is very important among cultures because in some cultures the aspect of losing face is so important right?

206
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:20,720
Right.

207
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:26,279
So somebody may not really want to assume guilt or they have to because it's part of the culture.

208
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,500
But what's the standard in North American business practice?

209
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:41,360
I would say that you would have to assume responsibility and take responsibility for your actions right and say yes it's my fault I did it but I'm going to get it fixed or I'll do it or I'll make up for it.

210
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,600
So some good business tips here today in this lesson.
