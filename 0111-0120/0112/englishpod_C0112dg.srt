EnglishPod.com Good afternoon.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Did you call for a plumber?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, yes I did.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please come in.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm so glad you came.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This old house is falling apart.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Come into the bathroom.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
See, here, there's water leaking everywhere.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I see.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me have a look.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let me just get my plunger.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, that's not working either.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You know how kids are.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That might lead to more problems in the future.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That would be great.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it expensive?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's see.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I would say about $800.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon.
