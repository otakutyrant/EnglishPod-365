EnglishPod.com Good afternoon.

2
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,300
Did you call for a plumber?

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,580
Yes, yes I did.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,660
Please come in.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,140
I'm so glad you came.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,899
This old house is falling apart.

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,460
Come into the bathroom.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,519
See, here, there's water leaking everywhere.

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:26,600
I see.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,899
Let me have a look.

11
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,240
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,479
Let me just get my plunger.

13
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:42,420
No, that's not working either.

14
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,960
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,200
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

16
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:52,520
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,679
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

18
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:56,179
You know how kids are.

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,259
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,740
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

21
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:06,680
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,920
That might lead to more problems in the future.

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,180
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,439
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,700
That would be great.

26
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:16,920
Is it expensive?

27
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,040
Let's see.

28
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,939
I would say about $800.

29
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:20,760
What?

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,840
That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon.
