00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And today we are going to be looking at a very useful lesson because, well, sometimes you need to call a plumber.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Okay, so first of all, why don't we start with vocabulary preview because I think we need to know this word, plumber.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Alright, so on vocabulary preview today we're going to look at two words and the first one is the one that we mentioned, plumber.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
A plumber.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So it's a person.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A plumber.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yep.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And a plumber is the person who fixes everything in your house that is related to water, right?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, so he fixes the toilet, the sink, the shower.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yep, that's the plumber.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And now the second word is obviously related to plumber and it's water pipes.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Water pipes.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Water pipes.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The pipes.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So the plumber fixes or looks at the water pipes as well.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yep, and those are a tube that carries water in and out of your house.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, so water pipes.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You also have different types of pipes like gas pipes.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay, so what are we learning in this lesson?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So in this lesson we're going to be learning how to describe when you have problems with plumbing.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
When you have problems in your sink or in your toilet and how you can describe it.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And so I think we should take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see what types of problems this woman is having with her plumbing.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Good afternoon.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Did you call for a plumber?

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, yes I did.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Please come in.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm so glad you came.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This old house is falling apart.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come into the bathroom.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
See, here.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
There's water leaking everywhere.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I see.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let me have a look.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let me just get my plunger.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, that's not working either.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You know how kids are.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That might lead to more problems in the future.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That would be great.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is it expensive?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's see.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I would say about $800.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's more than I'm making a...

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Alright, well it sounds like she's having some big problems with her plumbing, but actually I'm really interested that the plumber makes so much money.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That is a very interesting thing and we're going to talk a little bit about that later on, but I think we should look at those kind of difficult words that we found in the dialogue now in Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So we have five words here, all to do with a plumber and water pipes.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now the first word, they talked about that there was water leaking everywhere.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So you have water leaking.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Water leaking.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, to leak.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
When something leaks, it lets liquid come out when it shouldn't.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, when it shouldn't.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yep.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So maybe you have a bottle of water and it's closed, but maybe there's a hole in the bottle.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So it leaks.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So it leaks.

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Alright, and so there was water everywhere, it was leaking, and maybe the reason was because the toilet is clogged.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, clogged.

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The toilet's clogged.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Clogged.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now, what does it mean if the toilet is clogged?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If the toilet is clogged, there is something that stops the water from going down.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, so there's something blocking it.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, a clogged toilet.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now, the plumber said that it might be clogged and he tried to fix it with a plunger.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
A plunger.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A plunger.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A plunger.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay, so it's kind of hard to describe what a plunger is, so why don't we listen to the sound a plunger makes in a toilet.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Alright, so the plunger is the tool that you use to unclog a toilet.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Okay, that's what you use, a plunger.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So the plunger didn't work and he wasn't able to fix the toilet and he said that there's something in the pipes causing a blockage.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Alright, so our next word, a blockage.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Blockage.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, a blockage is something that stops water from flowing.

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, so something is blocking it.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So you have blockage.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yep.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Very good and we have one more word on language takeaway and that word is faucet.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
A faucet.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A faucet.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Alright, so the faucet is the part of the sink that lets water come out.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so you have a faucet in your sink.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, so you put your hands under the faucet so you can wash them.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, that's the faucet.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Very good.

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So now that we've learned about these different tools and these different ways of describing problems with your plumbing, let's listen to this dialogue another time a little bit slower now and then we'll come back and take a look at some great phrases.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Good afternoon.

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Did you call for a plumber?

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, yes I did.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please come in.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm so glad you came.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This old house is falling apart.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Come on into the bathroom.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,000
See?

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Here, there's water leaking everywhere.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I see.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let me have a look.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me just get my plunger.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No, that's not working either.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a blockage.

120
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You know how kids are.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty so they should also be changed.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That might lead to more problems in the future.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That would be great.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is it expensive?

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's see.

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I would say about $800.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, we've got three phrases that you can use when you need to describe something not working with the pipes.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The lady called the plumber and he arrived.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She described her house as old and that it's falling apart.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's falling apart.

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This old house is falling apart.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When something is falling apart, it's old and it's breaking slowly.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Exactly.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We can say the house is falling apart or maybe this old car is falling apart.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can also use it for people.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm getting so old, I'm falling apart.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Very good.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're getting sick.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Very good.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now for our second word.

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The woman said that maybe her daughter was flushing things down the toilet.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
To flush something down the toilet.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
To flush something down the toilet.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Before we explain this, let's listen to a toilet being flushed.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay, so that's the sound of flushing.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When you flush something down the toilet, what happens?

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Basically, you throw something into the toilet and then you flush it.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It goes away.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All right.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Flushing something down the toilet.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
She also talked about the faucet and it wasn't shutting off properly.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Shutting off?

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
To shut off.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, shut off.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
When you shut something off, you turn it off.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay, so we can say to shut something off or to shut off something.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Right.

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So, hey Marco, can you shut off the computer?

169
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, or I can say, can you shut the faucet off?

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Exactly.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Great, so we took a look at these three phrases that will help you describe again these situations or problems that may happen in your bathroom or with liquids.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I see.

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let me have a look.

175
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let me just get my plunger.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, that's not working either.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That might lead to more problems in the future.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

185
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's see, I would say about $800.

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, we heard in this dialogue that this plumber is making about $800.

188
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's a lot of money.

189
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's a lot of money.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And actually, this in many countries is not far from the truth.

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's right.

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
For example, in Canada, there is a shortage.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There's not enough of these people like plumbers who can do this type of work, so they can charge a lot of money.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So this type of work is called a...

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He's not really a professional, right?

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Right, but he is a trades person because he works in a trade.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Okay, so like a plumber, an electrician, a person that paints your house, those are all trades.

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And it is true because now many people don't want to learn or do these types of trade because it's not considered to be such a great job, right?

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, but the funny thing is now if you're a plumber and you get your first job as a young person, you can make so much more money than a person with a history degree, for example.

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Exactly, because there is a shortage of these types of...

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, you can call them professionals.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Right, so what about in your countries?

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let us know how these types of trades work.

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are there many of them?

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are there not many of them?

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because, well, of course, in different countries, it's a little bit different, right?

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In some countries, there are too many tradesmen.

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So visit us on our website, EnglishPod.com, and tell us all about that.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And remember, if you have any questions about the lesson, you can ask them there as well.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
All right, so we'll see you guys there, and until next time.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Bye.
