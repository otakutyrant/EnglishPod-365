00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,040
Hello, English learners.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,179
Welcome back to another podcast here with us at EnglishPod.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,219
My name is Marco.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,140
And I'm Erica.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,420
And today we are going to be looking at a very useful lesson because, well, sometimes you need to call a plumber.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,320
Okay, so first of all, why don't we start with vocabulary preview because I think we need to know this word, plumber.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,420
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:33,200
Alright, so on vocabulary preview today we're going to look at two words and the first one is the one that we mentioned, plumber.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,020
A plumber.

10
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:35,340
So it's a person.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,039
A plumber.

12
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:36,420
Yep.

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:43,359
And a plumber is the person who fixes everything in your house that is related to water, right?

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,859
Okay, so he fixes the toilet, the sink, the shower.

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,140
Yep, that's the plumber.

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,299
And now the second word is obviously related to plumber and it's water pipes.

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,299
Water pipes.

18
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:55,640
Water pipes.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,340
The pipes.

20
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,020
So the plumber fixes or looks at the water pipes as well.

21
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,840
Yep, and those are a tube that carries water in and out of your house.

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Okay, so water pipes.

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,299
You also have different types of pipes like gas pipes.

24
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:13,299
Okay.

25
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,760
Okay, so what are we learning in this lesson?

26
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,519
So in this lesson we're going to be learning how to describe when you have problems with plumbing.

27
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,620
When you have problems in your sink or in your toilet and how you can describe it.

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,379
And so I think we should take a look at our dialogue for the first time and see what types of problems this woman is having with her plumbing.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,439
Good afternoon.

30
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,640
Did you call for a plumber?

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:46,939
Yes, yes I did.

32
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,000
Please come in.

33
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,519
I'm so glad you came.

34
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,260
This old house is falling apart.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,799
Come into the bathroom.

36
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,000
See, here.

37
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:58,819
There's water leaking everywhere.

38
00:01:59,519 --> 00:01:59,980
I see.

39
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,140
Let me have a look.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,620
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,719
Let me just get my plunger.

42
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,800
No, that's not working either.

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,319
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

44
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,539
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,879
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

46
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,039
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

47
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:29,520
You know how kids are.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,620
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,099
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

50
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,060
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

51
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:42,300
That might lead to more problems in the future.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,560
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,860
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,099
That would be great.

55
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,319
Is it expensive?

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,439
Let's see.

57
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,379
I would say about $800.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,199
What?

59
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,159
That's more than I'm making a...

60
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:05,080
Alright, well it sounds like she's having some big problems with her plumbing, but actually I'm really interested that the plumber makes so much money.

61
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:16,900
That is a very interesting thing and we're going to talk a little bit about that later on, but I think we should look at those kind of difficult words that we found in the dialogue now in Language Takeaway.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,699
So we have five words here, all to do with a plumber and water pipes.

63
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,020
Now the first word, they talked about that there was water leaking everywhere.

64
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,539
So you have water leaking.

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,759
Water leaking.

66
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,280
So, to leak.

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,000
When something leaks, it lets liquid come out when it shouldn't.

68
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:43,620
Okay, when it shouldn't.

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:43,979
Yep.

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,479
So maybe you have a bottle of water and it's closed, but maybe there's a hole in the bottle.

71
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,159
So it leaks.

72
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,860
So it leaks.

73
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:58,819
Alright, and so there was water everywhere, it was leaking, and maybe the reason was because the toilet is clogged.

74
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,520
Okay, clogged.

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,020
The toilet's clogged.

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,099
Clogged.

77
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,000
Now, what does it mean if the toilet is clogged?

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,719
If the toilet is clogged, there is something that stops the water from going down.

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,979
Okay, so there's something blocking it.

80
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,599
Okay, a clogged toilet.

81
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,620
Now, the plumber said that it might be clogged and he tried to fix it with a plunger.

82
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,879
A plunger.

83
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,319
A plunger.

84
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,000
A plunger.

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:35,660
Okay, so it's kind of hard to describe what a plunger is, so why don't we listen to the sound a plunger makes in a toilet.

86
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,319
Alright, so the plunger is the tool that you use to unclog a toilet.

87
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,139
Okay, that's what you use, a plunger.

88
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,000
So the plunger didn't work and he wasn't able to fix the toilet and he said that there's something in the pipes causing a blockage.

89
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,199
Alright, so our next word, a blockage.

90
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,319
Blockage.

91
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,740
Well, a blockage is something that stops water from flowing.

92
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,500
Okay, so something is blocking it.

93
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,720
So you have blockage.

94
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,160
Yep.

95
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,279
Very good and we have one more word on language takeaway and that word is faucet.

96
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,259
A faucet.

97
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,620
A faucet.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,259
Alright, so the faucet is the part of the sink that lets water come out.

99
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,800
Okay, so you have a faucet in your sink.

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,220
Yeah, so you put your hands under the faucet so you can wash them.

101
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,980
Okay, that's the faucet.

102
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:34,220
Yeah.

103
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:34,759
Very good.

104
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:48,699
So now that we've learned about these different tools and these different ways of describing problems with your plumbing, let's listen to this dialogue another time a little bit slower now and then we'll come back and take a look at some great phrases.

105
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,120
Good afternoon.

106
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,660
Did you call for a plumber?

107
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,379
Yes, yes I did.

108
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,660
Please come in.

109
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,339
I'm so glad you came.

110
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,220
This old house is falling apart.

111
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,259
Come on into the bathroom.

112
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:04,920
See?

113
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,720
Here, there's water leaking everywhere.

114
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:08,759
I see.

115
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,139
Let me have a look.

116
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,379
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

117
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,800
Let me just get my plunger.

118
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,620
No, that's not working either.

119
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,779
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that's causing a blockage.

120
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:29,459
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

121
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,420
Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter.

122
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:36,579
She is always flushing things down the toilet.

123
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,459
You know how kids are.

124
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,540
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

125
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:46,319
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty so they should also be changed.

126
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,339
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

127
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,899
That might lead to more problems in the future.

128
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,560
I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

129
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,459
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

130
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,120
That would be great.

131
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:02,420
Is it expensive?

132
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,040
Let's see.

133
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,839
I would say about $800.

134
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:06,819
What?

135
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,420
That's more than I make in a day and I'm a heart surgeon.

136
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:19,660
Well, we've got three phrases that you can use when you need to describe something not working with the pipes.

137
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,060
Let's look at them now in Fluency Builder.

138
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,319
The lady called the plumber and he arrived.

139
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,699
She described her house as old and that it's falling apart.

140
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,560
It's falling apart.

141
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,279
This old house is falling apart.

142
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:42,259
When something is falling apart, it's old and it's breaking slowly.

143
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,100
Exactly.

144
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,160
We can say the house is falling apart or maybe this old car is falling apart.

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,639
You can also use it for people.

146
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,120
I'm getting so old, I'm falling apart.

147
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,899
Very good.

148
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,740
You're getting sick.

149
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,740
Very good.

150
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,759
Now for our second word.

151
00:07:58,459 --> 00:08:03,939
The woman said that maybe her daughter was flushing things down the toilet.

152
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,980
To flush something down the toilet.

153
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
To flush something down the toilet.

154
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,439
Before we explain this, let's listen to a toilet being flushed.

155
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:29,100
Okay, so that's the sound of flushing.

156
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:32,639
When you flush something down the toilet, what happens?

157
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,460
Basically, you throw something into the toilet and then you flush it.

158
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,320
It goes away.

159
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,039
All right.

160
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,820
Flushing something down the toilet.

161
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,369
She also talked about the faucet and it wasn't shutting off properly.

162
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,259
Shutting off?

163
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:48,759
To shut off.

164
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,500
Okay, shut off.

165
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,220
When you shut something off, you turn it off.

166
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,519
Okay, so we can say to shut something off or to shut off something.

167
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:58,860
Right.

168
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,840
So, hey Marco, can you shut off the computer?

169
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,460
Okay, or I can say, can you shut the faucet off?

170
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,059
Exactly.

171
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,120
Great, so we took a look at these three phrases that will help you describe again these situations or problems that may happen in your bathroom or with liquids.

172
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,240
Well, let's listen to the dialogue for the last time and we'll come back and talk a little bit more.

173
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,940
I see.

174
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,220
Let me have a look.

175
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,600
It seems that your toilet is clogged and that's why it won't flush.

176
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,720
Let me just get my plunger.

177
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,779
No, that's not working either.

178
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,320
I suspect that there's some sort of foreign object in the pipe that's causing a blockage.

179
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,539
That's what's making your toilet overflow.

180
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,639
Yeah, I have a little one myself.

181
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,080
Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed.

182
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,039
That could be causing water to not drain completely.

183
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,259
That might lead to more problems in the future.

184
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,539
I would suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly.

185
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,799
I could have it all finished by today if it's urgent.

186
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,320
Let's see, I would say about $800.

187
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,980
Well, we heard in this dialogue that this plumber is making about $800.

188
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,019
That's a lot of money.

189
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,299
That's a lot of money.

190
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,720
And actually, this in many countries is not far from the truth.

191
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:57,879
That's right.

192
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,539
For example, in Canada, there is a shortage.

193
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:09,539
There's not enough of these people like plumbers who can do this type of work, so they can charge a lot of money.

194
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,059
So this type of work is called a...

195
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,799
He's not really a professional, right?

196
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,000
Right, but he is a trades person because he works in a trade.

197
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:26,259
Okay, so like a plumber, an electrician, a person that paints your house, those are all trades.

198
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:37,080
And it is true because now many people don't want to learn or do these types of trade because it's not considered to be such a great job, right?

199
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:48,919
Yeah, but the funny thing is now if you're a plumber and you get your first job as a young person, you can make so much more money than a person with a history degree, for example.

200
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,080
Exactly, because there is a shortage of these types of...

201
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,320
Well, you can call them professionals.

202
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Right, so what about in your countries?

203
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,259
Let us know how these types of trades work.

204
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,460
Are there many of them?

205
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,120
Are there not many of them?

206
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,399
Because, well, of course, in different countries, it's a little bit different, right?

207
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,720
In some countries, there are too many tradesmen.

208
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:13,740
So visit us on our website, EnglishPod.com, and tell us all about that.

209
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:17,720
And remember, if you have any questions about the lesson, you can ask them there as well.

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,480
All right, so we'll see you guys there, and until next time.

211
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,279
Thanks for downloading and goodbye.

212
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,039
Bye.
