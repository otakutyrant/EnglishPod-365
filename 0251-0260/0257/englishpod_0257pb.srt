00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,700
Hello everybody, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,519
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:10,339
My name is Catherine, and we hope by now you're very excited about football or soccer.

4
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:16,800
This is the World Cup time of year, so this comes every four years, actually, and we've got a lesson all about it.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,519
That's right.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:28,859
So as everyone may or may not have heard, we are actually in the middle of the World Cup, and as you say, it's a football or soccer competition.

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:32,560
Now, soccer is only used in the United States.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,460
That's right.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,479
It's used in the United States, although football can be confusing in a place like Australia, where they have two different games that are called football.

10
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,119
That's right.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,960
So it's a little bit difficult at times to tell someone that you play football and they think you play American football or Australian football or soccer, so it's a little bit confusing.

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,799
It can be, yeah.

13
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:54,420
All right, so we have a great lesson all about the World Cup.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,399
We're going to explain a little bit, and so let's listen to the dialogue for the very first time.

15
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,980
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,159
The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,760
This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man.

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,480
Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy.

19
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,780
They first start in a group stage with eight groups, each group having four teams.

20
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,420
The top two teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the semifinals and the quarterfinals.

21
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,140
Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,159
Are you kidding?

23
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,120
Over 700 million people watch the final match of the 2006 World Cup.

24
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,659
It's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

25
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,879
Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,960
So far, Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,120
They're really good.

28
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:25,620
All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick.

29
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,199
It seems like a sissy sport to me.

30
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,800
Whatever.

31
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,560
I'm going to go watch the opening match.

32
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,659
All right, we're back.

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,860
So obviously two people discussing or fighting over the World Cup and soccer.

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,419
One of them doesn't really like it, but he came up with some really interesting points and explained a couple of interesting things.

35
00:02:52,419 --> 00:02:55,580
So let's take a look at some of that vocab on Language Takeaway.

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,180
So okay, the very first phrase here is a very important one.

37
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,699
We're talking about sports.

38
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:07,439
This game is called a sporting event.

39
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,000
That's right.

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:18,439
So a sporting event is an event, I guess you would say is a performance or something that happens occasionally, but related to sports.

41
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,180
That's right.

42
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,259
So an event can be a game itself or a tournament.

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,180
You've heard maybe of, well, the UEFA Cup.

44
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,439
That's the European Federation of Football or whatever it is.

45
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:37,520
So basically you have this tournament for European soccer teams, but the World Cup is also an event and a very important game could also be an event.

46
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,460
So this basically means a sporting match or a sporting competition.

47
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,159
That's right.

48
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:45,280
Now it may sound confusing as to why you put the ING in sport.

49
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:54,719
It should be maybe sports event or sport event, but I'm not really sure why we add the gerund to sporting event.

50
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,259
We always just say it this way.

51
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,780
It's a set phrase, so let's remember that it's sporting event.

52
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:03,039
This is the world's most important sporting event, for example.

53
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,120
Okay, very good.

54
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:14,860
Now we went and we talked about the first match, Mexico versus South Africa, and they're talking about the teams and how they both have a very strong offense.

55
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,019
Okay, so offense is a part of the team.

56
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,100
Basically it's a group of players who are trying to score.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:23,800
That's right.

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,800
So when you're good at offense, it means you're good at scoring.

59
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,040
And the opposite of offense is what?

60
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:30,779
Defense.

61
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:31,759
Defense.

62
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,819
So offense, defense.

63
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,639
You can say they have a very strong defense.

64
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:43,759
That means that it's very hard to score against them because their defenders, their goalies, they're all very strong.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,459
That's right.

66
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,100
So we're talking about an offense and a defense, both very important parts of a team.

67
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,879
And so the guy continued and made a little bit of a prediction saying that South Africa will probably dominate the first half.

68
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,579
Okay, so you know that football matches are split into halves, you have first half and second half.

69
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,740
To dominate here means to be stronger than someone else.

70
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:16,699
So to control the ball or to have possession or to be the one that is the strongest team on the field.

71
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,399
That's right.

72
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,060
So you can dominate by having a very strong defense or you can dominate by having a very strong offense or both.

73
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,199
Dominate means be stronger than.

74
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,120
That's right.

75
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,839
Okay, now let's move on to the other guy who doesn't really like soccer.

76
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:36,680
And he says, I have no idea what you're talking about, all I know is that I watch the Super Bowl.

77
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:40,500
Okay, now this is a very American thing, the Super Bowl.

78
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right.

79
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,500
We mentioned earlier that in America, most people call the game soccer, not football.

80
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,300
Well, that's because in America we have a different game called football.

81
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:48,959
That's right.

82
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,259
And so the Super Bowl is like the most important game in the football world.

83
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:57,019
It's the game that happens every year at the very end of the season.

84
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:57,860
That's right.

85
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,800
So this is what we usually call American football.

86
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,860
So you've probably seen it on TV as well.

87
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,019
And the Super Bowl is basically the name of the final sporting event of American football.

88
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,660
Just like we have World Cup, we have the Super Bowl.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,579
And the winner of the Super Bowl is the best team that year.

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,360
That's right.

91
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:23,399
All right, so now let's go on to explain a little bit about how the World Cup works.

92
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,199
The guy went on to explain that there are 32 countries competing.

93
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:35,699
And basically we have three parts, an elimination stage, a semi-finals, and quarterfinals.

94
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,259
Okay, so basically this describes the different levels.

95
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:44,360
Because obviously 32 teams can't compete for one trophy at first.

96
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,319
You have to make the numbers smaller.

97
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,300
So 32 becomes 16, becomes 8, becomes 4, becomes 2.

98
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,759
That's right.

99
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,439
And so we have different groups for these.

100
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,060
The first one is the elimination stage, when some teams lose and they go home.

101
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:58,800
That's right.

102
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:00,620
And after that, then we have a quarterfinals.

103
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:01,879
So what is quarterfinals?

104
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,180
The quarterfinals are when you have eight teams that are basically the top eight teams of the competition.

105
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,139
And they will play against one other opponent.

106
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,620
So the winner passes on to the next stage, which would be the semi-finals.

107
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,620
Well, the math makes sense.

108
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,579
Because quarter has to do with four, right?

109
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:21,060
That's right.

110
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,300
So in the quarterfinals, eight teams become four.

111
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,060
And in the semi-finals, four teams become two.

112
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:28,699
That's right.

113
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,500
And then what happens after the semi-finals?

114
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,500
And then we have the final, where basically the two top teams will compete against each other and there will be one champion.

115
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,399
USA!

116
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,259
USA!

117
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,259
And this is when it gets very nationalistic.

118
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,720
People are very proud of their countries.

119
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,860
Of course, of course.

120
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,139
And so this basically is what happens and how we get our champion.

121
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:59,360
And well, now let's explain a little bit very quickly about two things that happen in the game, during gameplay, when we have a free kick and a penalty kick.

122
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,439
Okay.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,399
So a kick, you know, you just kick the ball.

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:12,379
But sometimes when the ball goes out of bounds or when a player is injured or there's a foul, then that player or his teammate can take a special kick, all right?

125
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,879
And so a free kick is, it's just a kick from anywhere, right?

126
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,279
A free kick is a kick that you get basically according to the referee who says, okay, stop the game.

127
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,759
He's going to kick from inside the lines.

128
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:25,360
That's right.

129
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:34,840
So wherever you are fouled, wherever somebody maybe hit you wrong or something happened from that position, you will kick freely towards the goal or wherever you want.

130
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,039
You can pass to your other players as well.

131
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:37,620
That's right.

132
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,360
But a penalty kick is a bit different because you have to be in a special place when you do it.

133
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,019
That's right.

134
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:48,480
A penalty kick is when you are fouled inside the box, what they call it, in the area very close to the goalie.

135
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:56,899
So if you commit a foul there, then the other player will receive a penalty kick and it will just be him against the goalie and he must kick the ball.

136
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:59,879
I think it's approximately 10 meters, if I'm not mistaken.

137
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:00,200
Yes.

138
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:04,039
And this is why it's very dangerous because you're so close to the goalie and no one can stop you.

139
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,100
And so when fouls happen inside that special box, it's usually bad news for the goalie.

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,759
Yeah, of course.

141
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,519
So this is what happens during a penalty kick and, well, basically you have no defenders.

142
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,879
So it's just you, the goalie, and it can get, as you said, very complicated for the goalie.

143
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:23,440
So all right.

144
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,100
So we've taken a look at a lot of things on Language Takeaway.

145
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,720
Let's move on now to three phrases on Fluency Builder.

146
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:39,019
Okay, so this is a great word to describe how I felt last week when I watched the England vs.

147
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,240
America match.

148
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,679
I thought it was a nerve-wracking game.

149
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:43,320
That's right.

150
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,019
And we heard this in the dialogue, right?

151
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,899
Yeah, you said it was a very nerve-wracking game or in the dialogue the guy said it's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

152
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,679
So if something's nerve-wracking, what does it mean?

153
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,440
Well, basically if you break it down, nerves are those things in your body and your skin that make you feel.

154
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,179
So if someone hurts you, you feel it because of your nerves.

155
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:11,759
So something that is nerve-wracking makes you nervous, it makes you anxious, it makes you feel very sensitive.

156
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:12,480
That's right.

157
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:24,639
So of course the sporting event is so exciting and you're worried that your country or your team will lose that you're very nervous and you're very excited, you're very anxious, a lot of things are going on.

158
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Maybe you're sweating, maybe you're drinking a lot, you don't want to see your team lose and so you get very nervous.

159
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,480
That's right.

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,500
And now of course if your team is in the World Cup you are cheering on for your team or you're cheering them on.

161
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:45,639
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase because maybe you've heard the word to cheer before, you know, go team, go team, this is cheering.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,960
But we often say I want to cheer him on, okay?

163
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,519
So this on to me means like I want to cheer him on to victory, I want to push them towards some goal.

164
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,340
And so you hear this a lot, let's cheer them on.

165
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,440
Or he was really cheering me on, made me feel good.

166
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,580
Motivating you.

167
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:04,419
Motivating you.

168
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,960
So to cheer someone on, cheer them on.

169
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,639
All right, so obviously this is why we have cheerleaders, right?

170
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,580
Girls that cheer.

171
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,139
Give me an A, give me a B.

172
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,679
These are the girls or the group of girls that cheer teams on.

173
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,419
Or men too, I've seen male cheerleaders.

174
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,059
That's true.

175
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:27,740
All right, and now when we talked about Brazil, they are the team with the most titles under their belt.

176
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,740
Okay, we're not talking about a real belt here, are we?

177
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,440
No, no.

178
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:31,720
No.

179
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,080
Under your belt or under their belt in this case means that in their history they have the most titles.

180
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,340
That's right.

181
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:47,659
I think it may come from boxing or one of those sports where you actually wear a belt that says your title.

182
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:53,500
And I think, if I'm not mistaken, sometimes a boxing belt will have various titles on the belt.

183
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,759
Right, the championship belts.

184
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:55,120
Yeah.

185
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,899
Because they wear it afterwards.

186
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,019
I've never heard that before, but it does make sense.

187
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,580
But the important thing to remember here is that it's not just sports.

188
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:05,539
You could say he has 10 years of experience in marketing under his belt.

189
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,179
That's right.

190
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,360
That means he's experienced at marketing.

191
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,039
That's right.

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,940
So that's right.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:20,940
As you said, you can use it for work experience, you can use it for titles in work, or maybe in education you can say he's got three master's degrees under his belt.

194
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:24,419
All right, so a lot of great stuff there.

195
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:30,460
We've taken a look at a lot of vocabs, so I think we should listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

196
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,600
The first match is today.

197
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,399
It's Mexico versus South Africa.

198
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,440
It's going to be a really good match.

199
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,700
Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players.

200
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,080
I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country and all.

201
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,799
I have no idea what you're talking about.

202
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,980
The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.

203
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,580
This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man.

204
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,320
Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy.

205
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,919
They first start in a group stage with eight groups.

206
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,620
Each group having four teams.

207
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:30,299
The top two teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the semi-finals and the quarter-finals.

208
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,879
Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

209
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you kidding?

210
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,960
Over 700 million people watch the final match of the 2006 World Cup.

211
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,500
It's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

212
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,700
Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion.

213
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,799
So far, Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt.

214
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,960
They're really good.

215
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:59,440
All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick.

216
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,000
It seems like a sissy sport to me.

217
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,639
Whatever.

218
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,379
I'm going to go watch the opening match.

219
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:21,659
All right, so the World Cup, as we said, it gathers over 100 million people to watch the final in 2006 now.

220
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,840
This sport is not very popular in North America.

221
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:25,940
It's not.

222
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:29,519
Well, that's not totally true because Mexicans really follow football.

223
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:30,320
That's right.

224
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:30,759
That's right.

225
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,399
But I think in America, in the United States, it is one of the less popular sports.

226
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,860
I was thinking the other day maybe number five on our list of popular sports.

227
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,139
Maybe because, well, you have American football, the NFL.

228
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,840
You have Major League Baseball.

229
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,820
You have the NBA.

230
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,899
You have the NHL.

231
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:57,179
And I think maybe before soccer, you probably either have golf or tennis before soccer.

232
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,000
Even though the United States does have its own Major League Soccer.

233
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:01,620
Yep.

234
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:02,179
MLS.

235
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:03,200
Major League Soccer.

236
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,240
And my hometown team is Chicago Fire.

237
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:06,100
Pretty good team.

238
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,620
I heard they're very good.

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,519
And the L.A.

240
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,379
Galaxy, I think, is the other best team in the States.

241
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,159
That's right.

242
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,100
Now, the United States did host the 1994 World Cup.

243
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,279
And I think this is where a little bit of more interest started to come up.

244
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,580
And I think Major League Soccer was formed prior to the World Cup in the United States.

245
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:26,320
That's right.

246
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,379
Well, there's another part of it.

247
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,759
I mean, as young people, as children, we almost all played soccer.

248
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,179
I played soccer.

249
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,740
I know a lot of my friends did as well.

250
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,700
It's not popular everywhere, but a lot of people play it.

251
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:42,299
And there's not really an audience for soccer in America once you're in the professional realm.

252
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:49,539
And so the problem is, when you pass college, you don't think of it as the NBA, for example, because there's not as big of an audience.

253
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,320
And so people just end up doing their normal jobs as opposed to being professional soccer players.

254
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:01,580
I think that has a big something to do with it, is the fact that there is not as much money in this sport professionally as, for example, the NBA.

255
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:02,360
Or prestige.

256
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,279
Exactly.

257
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:14,100
Although, on the other hand, these players that do make it and they really want to play, they go abroad and they go play in the European leagues or something like that.

258
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:14,320
That's right.

259
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:25,820
I think a lot of the American players who were playing the other day against England were playing against their teammates because so many of the American team, the American national team, play in the English Premier League.

260
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,519
It was really awkward.

261
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,679
Well, it's a really great sport.

262
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,360
I think it's one of the most popular sports in many other countries as well because it's so easy.

263
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,320
All you need is a ball.

264
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:37,240
You need a group of people.

265
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,480
You put two rocks and you have a goal and you start playing.

266
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:47,039
And that's probably why it's the most international sport because it's very easy to set up.

267
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,860
People all over the world love it and hopefully one day the United States will kind of push it.

268
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:57,639
Yeah, well, I hope this year they'll become champions, but my fingers are definitely crossed because who knows?

269
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:00,120
All right, so it's a really great topic.

270
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:02,279
We want to know if your country is in the World Cup.

271
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:04,440
Have you ever qualified for a World Cup?

272
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,299
There are still many countries who haven't made it.

273
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:14,740
Of course, it's a very small pool, 198, 199 countries compete to qualify for the World Cup and only 32 make it.

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,640
And you can also tell us who you're supporting.

275
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,380
We won't judge.

276
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,380
That's right.

277
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,119
So we're waiting for your comments at EnglishPod.com.

278
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,859
We'll see everyone there.

279
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,259
Bye.

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,519
Bye.
