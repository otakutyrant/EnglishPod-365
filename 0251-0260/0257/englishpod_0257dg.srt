EnglishPod.com What are you doing?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What am I doing?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What am I doing?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't you know what day it is?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Umm...no.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The World Cup!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The first match is today.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's Mexico versus South Africa.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's going to be a really good match.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country and all.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man!

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Teams from thirty two countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They first start in a group stage with eight groups.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Each group having four teams.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The top two teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the semi-finals and the quarter-finals.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you kidding?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Over seven hundred million people watch the final match of the 2006 World Cup.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So far, Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They're really good.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It seems like a sissy sport to me.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Whatever.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to go watch the opening match.
