EnglishPod.com What are you doing?

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,859
What am I doing?

3
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:12,800
What am I doing?

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,240
Don't you know what day it is?

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,300
Umm...no.

6
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:20,399
It's only the day when the world's biggest sporting event is kicking off.

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:20,980
What?

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,379
The World Cup!

9
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:23,640
The first match is today.

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,440
It's Mexico versus South Africa.

11
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,500
It's going to be a really good match.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,780
Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players.

13
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:35,159
I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country and all.

14
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,859
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:41,039
The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.

16
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,640
This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man!

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,380
Teams from thirty two countries compete against each other every four years and fight to win that trophy.

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,979
They first start in a group stage with eight groups.

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,679
Each group having four teams.

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,359
The top two teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the semi-finals and the quarter-finals.

21
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:02,939
Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn't really appeal to me.

22
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,040
Are you kidding?

23
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:08,000
Over seven hundred million people watch the final match of the 2006 World Cup.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,540
It's a very exciting and nerve-wracking sport.

25
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,760
Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion.

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,859
So far, Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,000
They're really good.

28
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:27,500
All I know about soccer is that you can't use your hands and that players are always falling down trying to get a free kick or penalty kick.

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,040
It seems like a sissy sport to me.

30
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:30,700
Whatever.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,439
I'm going to go watch the opening match.
