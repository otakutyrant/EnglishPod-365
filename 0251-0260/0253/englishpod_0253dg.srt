EnglishPod.com Okay, Rebecca.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Definitely.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Well, in a way, yes.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself, it's true.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yes, please.
