00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we've got one more episode in our series about interview skills.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is an elementary level series, and we're here today to talk about things that you might not be very good at.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today we're going to talk about weaknesses, and that is our word for vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's take a look at it now.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, so what is a weakness?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A weakness is a thing or an activity or something that you're just not very good at or something that you think you can improve.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, so obviously no one is perfect.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And like we saw in the previous lesson, we have a lot of good things about ourselves, key strengths.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And now we're going to talk about our weaknesses.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Maybe you're a little bit lazy.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That might be a weakness.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
All right, so weakness is the opposite of strength, and that is the topic today.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, Rebecca.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Definitely.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, in a way, yes.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself, it's true.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, please.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
All right, we're back, so obviously Rebecca did a very good job at talking about her weaknesses in a very positive way.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So before we get into analyzing that, why don't we take a look at a couple of words she used on language takeaway.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Language takeaway.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
One of the first words that Mr.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Parsons used was a clear impression.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So impression.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right, so I think this is a very common word when people talk about first impressions, or I get the impression.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So what is an impression?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, an impression is like an idea or a feeling.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So I can have an impression about something, it means that I don't necessarily understand it really well, or don't have experience with it, but it's an idea that I have about something.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right, so for example, maybe you meet somebody new, and you say, I get the impression that he is a liar.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But maybe then you get to know him and he's not.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So this is your idea about something or the way you feel about something.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So in this case, Mr.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Parsons has a clear impression of her positive qualities.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That means that he has an idea or an understanding of the things that Rebecca is good at, but he wants to know more about her weaknesses.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right, and Mr.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Parsons asked her to try and pinpoint one of her weaknesses.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So this word, to pinpoint.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is a great word, I'm not really sure where it comes from in English, but I think it's very visual.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can see what the word means.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Pinpoint means to locate or identify or really be specific about something.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So maybe if you go to the doctor and you say that your back hurts, the doctor might ask you to try and pinpoint where on your back you have the pain.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's right, so it's a way to be specific or very exact about something.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Okay, so if she had to pinpoint something, she said, well, I do get a little bit frustrated.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, so frustrated is a way you feel.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I feel frustrated, he is frustrated.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's basically a feeling that you get when you have to do something but you don't think you can do it, or maybe something annoys you and you get frustrated.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For example, when people tap like this and I'm working, I get frustrated because it's a distraction, so everyone has different things that frustrate them.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now if we take a look at this word, it is actually an adjective and we usually use it, you get frustrated or as you said, you feel frustrated.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So remember, it may look like a verb but it's actually an adjective that ends in ED, frustrated, to get frustrated.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He got frustrated or we feel very frustrated.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, and well apart from being frustrated, she also said that she is a restless character.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay, so someone is restless if they don't like to stay in one place all the time.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That means someone who wants to move around or to go places or to travel or to see new things is restless.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's right.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So she has a restless character, that means she likes to move around.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She doesn't like to stand still in one place.

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Maybe she gets bored very easily.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, so that's somebody that would be restless.

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But moving on, she also said that she doesn't like to shirk her responsibilities.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, you often hear these words go together.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So responsibilities are things that we need to do, right?

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Things that other people expect us to do.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
To shirk a responsibility means to not do something that you're supposed to do.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It means to avoid responsibility or to push it away.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, so it's a verb, to shirk your responsibilities.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You shouldn't shirk your responsibilities.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's right.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
All right, so a lot of interesting keywords there.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, Rebecca, well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

96
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, in a way, yes.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself, it's true.

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Okay, well, let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes, please.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So we've picked out three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's take a look at those now, starting with Mr.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Parsons saying, So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Two great phrases there.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So the first phrase, if things don't go your way.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So this is kind of a funny phrase when you think about it, because they go your way like to me or what is my way.

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This basically means if things do not happen in a way that makes you happy or in a way that you expect.

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, so we could say he lost his job, he couldn't pay his bills, things just didn't go his way.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right.

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So things are not happening as he planned or as he expected.

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can also say the opposite.

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So he won the lottery and he also met a really beautiful girl who wanted to be his girlfriend.

116
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Things were going his way.

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okay, very good.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
So if things are going your way, it's good.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If things aren't going your way, then it's bad.

120
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's right.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay, and so if things aren't going Rebecca's way, does that mean that it could easily get her down?

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, so to get you down or to get someone down means to make you sad, upset or frustrated like that where we just heard.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So you could ask someone like Marco, what gets you down?

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Rainy days.

125
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's a good one.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, rainy days get me down too.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So it's kind of a way of saying what makes you sad or depressed or what makes you unhappy.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or in this case, if something doesn't happen as you planned it, if it doesn't go your way, does that make you sad?

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Does that get you down?

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay, very good.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So a very good question there.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And she responded that kind of, yeah, that does happen, but she always tries to give 110%.

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, so this is a really funny phrase because you think I can give everything I have.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can work really hard and that's 100%.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But we say 110% means you do more than you can.

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's like pushing yourself more than is possible.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So this is a very common phrase in sports and business.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
People are saying, for example, I always remember my coach saying, I want you guys to give me 110% out there.

140
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That means like I really want you to try very hard to do as much as possible.

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Even more than your best, more than you think you can do.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Exactly.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So again, it refers to the effort that you put into something.

144
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It can be in business, sports, anything.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And she's basically saying, I always do more than my best.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I do as much as humanly possible.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's right.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So a lot of great stuff there from Rebecca.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why don't we listen to her one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, Rebecca.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Definitely.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
My father always taught me to be a high achiever.

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, in a way, yes.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

163
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

165
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself.

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's true.

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, please.

170
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
All right.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So talking about weaknesses, I think one of the common mistakes when people talk about weaknesses is they say they work too much, and everyone says you should never say that in an interview.

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, I think it's a bad way to talk about yourself because a boss or an employer really wants to hear a real weakness, and I work too hard is a way of saying, I have no weaknesses.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm actually really, really perfect.

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I just think it's a lazy answer.

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So maybe you should avoid saying I work too hard and really focus on things that you do have to work on.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And then I think the key is to say that I know this is something that I have a hard time with.

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I know this is a weakness, and I'm trying to improve it.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yeah, I remember in some of the interviews I've had, I think my common answer was I am sometimes I'm very late.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm not very punctual.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So but you know, it's a real weakness, and it may seem like difficult, but then you give it a little spin by saying, yeah, I'm sometimes not very punctual, but then I try to make up for it.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Maybe it's staying more time at the office, or sometimes I try to wake up a little bit earlier and make it on time.

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know, something like that.

183
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So the key there is just to show that you know it's a problem and that you're trying to work on it.

184
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So this is actually the hardest part for me of an interview, talking about yourself in a negative way, because obviously you want to get the job, so you want to make sure that the employer has a good idea of yourself, but it's hard.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think it's the hardest part for everyone.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yeah.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't think it's just you.

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, it's hard.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So this is an interesting topic.

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why don't you practice and come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and on our comments section, why don't you tell us what your weaknesses are?

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's right.

193
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We hope to hear from you.

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Of course, you can also share with us your strengths on our lesson about strengths.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But in this one, I recommend everyone practice this, because it will come up at some point, and it's good to get the practice in.

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So EnglishPod.com, we hope to see you there.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right, guys.

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Bye.
