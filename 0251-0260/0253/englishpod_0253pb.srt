00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,940
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,259
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:07,459 --> 00:00:11,539
And today we've got one more episode in our series about interview skills.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,359
This is an elementary level series, and we're here today to talk about things that you might not be very good at.

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,079
That's right.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
Today we're going to talk about weaknesses, and that is our word for vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,000
So let's take a look at it now.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,940
Vocabulary preview.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,059
Okay, so what is a weakness?

11
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,399
A weakness is a thing or an activity or something that you're just not very good at or something that you think you can improve.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,679
Okay, so obviously no one is perfect.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,219
And like we saw in the previous lesson, we have a lot of good things about ourselves, key strengths.

14
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:50,460
And now we're going to talk about our weaknesses.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,659
Maybe you're a little bit lazy.

16
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:53,619
That might be a weakness.

17
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,340
That's right.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,340
All right, so weakness is the opposite of strength, and that is the topic today.

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,179
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,840
Okay, Rebecca.

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,359
Well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

22
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:15,280
Okay.

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,099
Well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

24
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,140
Definitely.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,939
But if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

26
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:28,040
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,739
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,099
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

29
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:37,939
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

30
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,939
Well, in a way, yes.

31
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:45,519
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

32
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,760
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

33
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,980
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,859
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself, it's true.

35
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, well let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,040
Yes, please.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,319
All right, we're back, so obviously Rebecca did a very good job at talking about her weaknesses in a very positive way.

38
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,080
So before we get into analyzing that, why don't we take a look at a couple of words she used on language takeaway.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,099
Language takeaway.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,800
One of the first words that Mr.

41
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,259
Parsons used was a clear impression.

42
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,340
So impression.

43
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,719
All right, so I think this is a very common word when people talk about first impressions, or I get the impression.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,879
So what is an impression?

45
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,020
Well, an impression is like an idea or a feeling.

46
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:52,080
So I can have an impression about something, it means that I don't necessarily understand it really well, or don't have experience with it, but it's an idea that I have about something.

47
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:59,159
That's right, so for example, maybe you meet somebody new, and you say, I get the impression that he is a liar.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,680
But maybe then you get to know him and he's not.

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,360
So this is your idea about something or the way you feel about something.

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,199
So in this case, Mr.

51
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,360
Parsons has a clear impression of her positive qualities.

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,680
That means that he has an idea or an understanding of the things that Rebecca is good at, but he wants to know more about her weaknesses.

53
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,080
That's right, and Mr.

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,080
Parsons asked her to try and pinpoint one of her weaknesses.

55
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,740
So this word, to pinpoint.

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
This is a great word, I'm not really sure where it comes from in English, but I think it's very visual.

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,400
You can see what the word means.

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,300
Pinpoint means to locate or identify or really be specific about something.

59
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,039
That's right.

60
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:51,259
So maybe if you go to the doctor and you say that your back hurts, the doctor might ask you to try and pinpoint where on your back you have the pain.

61
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,639
That's right, so it's a way to be specific or very exact about something.

62
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:02,879
Okay, so if she had to pinpoint something, she said, well, I do get a little bit frustrated.

63
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:06,139
Okay, so frustrated is a way you feel.

64
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:08,400
I feel frustrated, he is frustrated.

65
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:18,120
It's basically a feeling that you get when you have to do something but you don't think you can do it, or maybe something annoys you and you get frustrated.

66
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:29,759
For example, when people tap like this and I'm working, I get frustrated because it's a distraction, so everyone has different things that frustrate them.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,139
Now if we take a look at this word, it is actually an adjective and we usually use it, you get frustrated or as you said, you feel frustrated.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,040
So remember, it may look like a verb but it's actually an adjective that ends in ED, frustrated, to get frustrated.

69
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:49,259
He got frustrated or we feel very frustrated.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,740
Okay, and well apart from being frustrated, she also said that she is a restless character.

71
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,620
Okay, so someone is restless if they don't like to stay in one place all the time.

72
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,839
That means someone who wants to move around or to go places or to travel or to see new things is restless.

73
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,959
That's right.

74
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,720
So she has a restless character, that means she likes to move around.

75
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,480
She doesn't like to stand still in one place.

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,500
Maybe she gets bored very easily.

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,480
Okay, so that's somebody that would be restless.

78
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:28,740
But moving on, she also said that she doesn't like to shirk her responsibilities.

79
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,279
Okay, you often hear these words go together.

80
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,839
So responsibilities are things that we need to do, right?

81
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,860
Things that other people expect us to do.

82
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,199
To shirk a responsibility means to not do something that you're supposed to do.

83
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,339
It means to avoid responsibility or to push it away.

84
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,300
Okay, so it's a verb, to shirk your responsibilities.

85
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,300
You shouldn't shirk your responsibilities.

86
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:54,839
That's right.

87
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,620
All right, so a lot of interesting keywords there.

88
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,220
Why don't we listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

89
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:13,160
Okay, Rebecca, well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

90
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:16,899
Okay, well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

91
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,720
Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,839
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

93
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,540
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

94
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,180
My father always taught me to be a high achiever, so...

95
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,160
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

96
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,139
Well, in a way, yes.

97
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,740
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

98
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,959
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

99
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,180
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

100
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,079
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself, it's true.

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,220
Okay, well, let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

102
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Yes, please.

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,120
So we've picked out three key phrases for you on Fluency Builder.

104
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,839
Let's take a look at those now, starting with Mr.

105
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:20,500
Parsons saying, So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

106
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
Two great phrases there.

107
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:22,740
That's right.

108
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,480
So the first phrase, if things don't go your way.

109
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:33,060
So this is kind of a funny phrase when you think about it, because they go your way like to me or what is my way.

110
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:40,339
This basically means if things do not happen in a way that makes you happy or in a way that you expect.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,620
Okay, so we could say he lost his job, he couldn't pay his bills, things just didn't go his way.

112
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:48,259
That's right.

113
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,779
So things are not happening as he planned or as he expected.

114
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,259
You can also say the opposite.

115
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:01,560
So he won the lottery and he also met a really beautiful girl who wanted to be his girlfriend.

116
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,180
Things were going his way.

117
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:04,360
Okay, very good.

118
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,959
So if things are going your way, it's good.

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,519
If things aren't going your way, then it's bad.

120
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,000
That's right.

121
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,279
Okay, and so if things aren't going Rebecca's way, does that mean that it could easily get her down?

122
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:25,060
Okay, so to get you down or to get someone down means to make you sad, upset or frustrated like that where we just heard.

123
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:29,339
So you could ask someone like Marco, what gets you down?

124
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,699
Rainy days.

125
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:31,759
That's a good one.

126
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,500
Yeah, rainy days get me down too.

127
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,500
So it's kind of a way of saying what makes you sad or depressed or what makes you unhappy.

128
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,919
Or in this case, if something doesn't happen as you planned it, if it doesn't go your way, does that make you sad?

129
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
Does that get you down?

130
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,100
Okay, very good.

131
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,799
So a very good question there.

132
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:57,279
And she responded that kind of, yeah, that does happen, but she always tries to give 110%.

133
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,240
Okay, so this is a really funny phrase because you think I can give everything I have.

134
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:04,419
I can work really hard and that's 100%.

135
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,460
But we say 110% means you do more than you can.

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,399
It's like pushing yourself more than is possible.

137
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:12,320
That's right.

138
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,980
So this is a very common phrase in sports and business.

139
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,000
People are saying, for example, I always remember my coach saying, I want you guys to give me 110% out there.

140
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,360
That means like I really want you to try very hard to do as much as possible.

141
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,960
Even more than your best, more than you think you can do.

142
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:31,679
Exactly.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,080
So again, it refers to the effort that you put into something.

144
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
It can be in business, sports, anything.

145
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,679
And she's basically saying, I always do more than my best.

146
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,940
I do as much as humanly possible.

147
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,700
That's right.

148
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:44,399
Okay.

149
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,259
So a lot of great stuff there from Rebecca.

150
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,120
Why don't we listen to her one last time and we'll be back in a bit.

151
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,299
Okay, Rebecca.

152
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,799
Well, I think you've given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let's talk a little bit about your weaknesses.

153
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:05,700
Okay.

154
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,559
Well, it's always more difficult to describe them, isn't it?

155
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,559
Definitely.

156
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,419
But if you had to pinpoint one weakness, what would it be?

157
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,480
Well, as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don't see progress in my work or career.

158
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,159
I suppose I'm quite a restless character.

159
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,919
My father always taught me to be a high achiever.

160
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,379
So would you say if things don't go your way at work, it could easily get you down?

161
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:30,360
Well, in a way, yes.

162
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,940
But I must say that even if I'm not completely happy in my work, I always give 110%.

163
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,179
I would never shirk my responsibilities.

164
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,480
I suppose sometimes I expect too much too soon.

165
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,700
Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself.

166
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:48,279
It's true.

167
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:49,399
Okay.

168
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,440
Well, let's move on to talk about the job position here, shall we?

169
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,539
Yes, please.

170
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:00,279
All right.

171
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:10,460
So talking about weaknesses, I think one of the common mistakes when people talk about weaknesses is they say they work too much, and everyone says you should never say that in an interview.

172
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:23,840
Yeah, I think it's a bad way to talk about yourself because a boss or an employer really wants to hear a real weakness, and I work too hard is a way of saying, I have no weaknesses.

173
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,559
I'm actually really, really perfect.

174
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,759
I just think it's a lazy answer.

175
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,759
So maybe you should avoid saying I work too hard and really focus on things that you do have to work on.

176
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,580
And then I think the key is to say that I know this is something that I have a hard time with.

177
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,220
I know this is a weakness, and I'm trying to improve it.

178
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:50,600
Yeah, I remember in some of the interviews I've had, I think my common answer was I am sometimes I'm very late.

179
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,559
I'm not very punctual.

180
00:11:52,579 --> 00:12:04,799
So but you know, it's a real weakness, and it may seem like difficult, but then you give it a little spin by saying, yeah, I'm sometimes not very punctual, but then I try to make up for it.

181
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:12,000
Maybe it's staying more time at the office, or sometimes I try to wake up a little bit earlier and make it on time.

182
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,879
I don't know, something like that.

183
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,960
So the key there is just to show that you know it's a problem and that you're trying to work on it.

184
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:17,279
Yeah.

185
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:29,940
So this is actually the hardest part for me of an interview, talking about yourself in a negative way, because obviously you want to get the job, so you want to make sure that the employer has a good idea of yourself, but it's hard.

186
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,419
I think it's the hardest part for everyone.

187
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:31,700
Yeah.

188
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,700
I don't think it's just you.

189
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,460
Yeah, it's hard.

190
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,259
So this is an interesting topic.

191
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:42,879
Why don't you practice and come to our website, EnglishPod.com, and on our comments section, why don't you tell us what your weaknesses are?

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,700
That's right.

193
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,580
We hope to hear from you.

194
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:48,259
Of course, you can also share with us your strengths on our lesson about strengths.

195
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:54,019
But in this one, I recommend everyone practice this, because it will come up at some point, and it's good to get the practice in.

196
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,019
So EnglishPod.com, we hope to see you there.

197
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:56,600
All right, guys.

198
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,139
Bye.
