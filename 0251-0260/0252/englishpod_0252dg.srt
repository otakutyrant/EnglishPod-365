00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:09,240
EnglishPod.com Alright, settle down everyone.

2
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:13,419
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex ed this week.

3
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,100
Oh boy, yeah.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,339
Now, I want everyone to take this class seriously.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,820
Sexual education is very important, and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,140
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

7
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:29,579
Ms.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,340
Carleton, what exactly is sexual education?

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,159
Are you going to teach us, like, Kamasutra and stuff like that?

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,479
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex ed is.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,060
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male and female bodies work.

12
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,340
My older sister is in college, and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,659
I never really understood what that is.

14
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,340
But I know it has to do with sex or something.

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,619
Good point, Jason.

16
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,899
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,480
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

18
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:16,939
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

19
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:19,420
Another popular method is using condoms.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:27,260
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

21
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:28,840
Yes, Jason?

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,980
What are condoms made out of?

23
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,680
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,819
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

25
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:41,260
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.
