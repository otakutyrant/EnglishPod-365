00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
EnglishPod.com Alright, settle down everyone.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex ed this week.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh boy, yeah.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, I want everyone to take this class seriously.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sexual education is very important, and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ms.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Carleton, what exactly is sexual education?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you going to teach us, like, Kamasutra and stuff like that?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex ed is.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male and female bodies work.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My older sister is in college, and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I never really understood what that is.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But I know it has to do with sex or something.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Good point, Jason.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Another popular method is using condoms.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, Jason?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are condoms made out of?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.
