00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking about something that's very common in high schools all across the English-speaking world.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we are going to talk a little bit about sexual education, or also called sex-ed.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So you may be asking yourself what exactly this means, so let's take a look at this word on vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, so more commonly than not, we're going to hear the phrase sex-ed, E-D, that stands for education.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is basically a class or a training about sexuality and safety when it comes to these issues.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's right.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So as you said, this is a very common class that is part of the school curriculum in English-speaking countries.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I think maybe students are about 16 to 15, 16 years old when they get sex-ed.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We had it when I was about 13, 14.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
13, 14.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So it all depends.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, many countries don't really have this in their public schools.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Other countries only have it in private schools.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So it's a very controversial topic about if schools should actually be teaching this, but we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why don't we take a look at today's dialogue?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's listen to what's happening today.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
All right, settle down, everyone.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex-ed this week.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, boy.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, I want everyone to take this class seriously.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Sexual education is very important, and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ms.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Carlton, what exactly is sexual education?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you going to teach us, like, Kamasutra and stuff like that?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex-ed is.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male and female bodies work.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My older sister is in college, and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good point, Jason.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Another popular method is using condoms.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, Jason?

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What are condoms made out of?

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
All right, we're back.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now I'm sure there are a couple of words that we didn't really understand there, so let's take a look at a couple of them on language takeaway.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Language takeaway.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
One of the most common phrases you're going to hear when it comes to sex and safety when you're having sex is sexually transmitted disease, or STD.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The teacher actually mentioned the whole name, sexually transmitted diseases, and also she used the acronym STDs, or STD in STD.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What exactly are these STDs?

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The key word here is disease.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
These are illnesses that you can get from sex.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Sexually transmitted means transmitted or passed on from one person to another person during sex, and this could include any kind of diseases like AIDS, or syphilis, or chlamydia, or gonorrhea.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Those are the most famous ones.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's right.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So sexually transmitted diseases.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Now why don't we get into the title of our lesson today, contraceptives.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are these contraceptives?

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, so teachers are always going to explain the big difference between protection and contraception or contraceptives.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Basically contraceptives have to do with getting pregnant.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you don't want your girlfriend to get pregnant and you're a guy, or if you're a girl and you don't want to get pregnant, you take contraceptives or you use contraceptives.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There are many different kinds, and I think the most common kind for preventing a pregnancy or making sure you don't get pregnant is something called the pill.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One of the kids said that his sister takes the pill.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now this is called the pill.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Now you know that pills are any type of a capsule or little medicine that you swallow with water, but what is the pill?

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well this is the birth control pill.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So that's a long name.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
People often in conversation just say the pill, but it's called the birth control pill, and it's a pill that women take every day, or some of them different times, to prevent pregnancy.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And so that means that you're trying not to get pregnant.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's right.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, so this is called a contraceptive.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Now as you mentioned, this is a contraceptive, so it will prevent you from getting pregnant, but it will not protect you, and as many of you may know, the most common form of protection against pregnancy and STDs are a little device called a condom.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay so a condom is, like you said, the most common kind of protection that people use, and it's important because it helps you not only not get pregnant, but also not get a disease.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so people often talk about this as being the most important kind of protection from disease and pregnancy, and it's basically just a cover for a man's penis, and it prevents liquids being passed on from one person to another person.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right, and actually as you mentioned, this has to do with our next word.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It prevents you from contracting STDs, like the teacher mentioned.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So to contract an STD, or to contract an illness, what does that mean?

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, contract is a special verb that we use when we're talking about getting a disease.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't say, I got a disease, you say, I contracted it.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That means I got it from somewhere or someone, and that's one of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can contract very serious diseases just by having sex.

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now can I say, I contracted the flu?

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I mean, it's not incorrect, but we don't really say that with the flu.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's not a very serious illness.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You say it with very serious illnesses.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So yeah, I don't think you would go around saying, oh, I contracted a cold last week.

90
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I got the cold.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And you wouldn't say this about cancer either, because cancer is not something you get from someone else.

92
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But you say he contracted AIDS, or he contracted gonorrhea, for example.

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay, very good.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So as you see, the spelling is actually the same as a contract, like an agreement between a company or two people.

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But the accent is different.

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A contract is an agreement to contract that, what we're talking about, illnesses.

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To get.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
All right, very good.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And for our final word, we're going back to condoms.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The material that they are made out of is called latex.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay, so latex is a very special kind of material that is, like they say in the dialogue, elastic.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's stretchy.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And it's almost plasticky, but it's very, very tough.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's very strong, and that's why they make condoms out of it.

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And I think we also see things made out of latex, for example.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Doctors, when they're operating, they wear latex gloves.

107
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's right.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Obviously, they don't want to use materials that are weak or that are thin, because they need to protect their patients from germs.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And so latex gloves and latex condoms are very, very common, because they are so durable.

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's right.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Great.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So a lot of interesting stuff there.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why don't we now jump on over and take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fluency Builder.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So this first phrase is something you should be very, very familiar with if you've ever been in a classroom in America or Canada.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oftentimes with younger children or with high school children, people get really worked up, very excited.

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Kids are yelling and talking, and they're giggling, and they think that, oh, sex is so funny.

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And so the teacher always says, settle down.

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Settle down.

121
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay.

122
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So if somebody tells you to settle down, hey, hey, settle down, settle down.

123
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That means calm down.

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Be quiet.

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're too excited.

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Calm down.

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So you can use this with your kids.

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Maybe settle down.

129
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We need to go.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Come on.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Get in the car.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So just kind of be quiet.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Be a little bit calmer.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a very, very, very important phrase, especially if you're talking to younger people.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

137
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And well, of course, when you're talking about sex with teenagers or younger people, everyone's laughing and giggling because it's such a weird thing for them.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And the teacher said, I really want you to take this class seriously.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So take this class seriously.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
This comes from a sentence structure that's very, very important to take something seriously.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I take my studies very seriously.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Or you guys should take this class seriously.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's important.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It means, listen, pay attention.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is important, and you need to know this.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's kind of like a way to instruct someone to really pay attention.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Or what if you say, I want you to take me seriously?

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That means I want you to really think about what I'm saying and not just talk to me like I don't really understand what's going on.

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okay.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Very good.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So to take something seriously is the structure.

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now moving on to our final phrase.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
When we were talking again about contraceptives, we talked about avoiding pregnancy.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And we have a phrase that we use called unwanted pregnancy.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So pregnancy is what happens when someone gets pregnant.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They're going to have a baby.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But an unwanted pregnancy is a certain kind of pregnancy.

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It means when someone did not plan to get pregnant or did not want to get pregnant.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So unwanted is the opposite of wanted.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It means like it was an accident.

163
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So you wouldn't really say an accidental pregnancy because it, you know.

164
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's still a kid.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Exactly.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Exactly.

167
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So you didn't want to get pregnant, but you did.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's why we say unwanted pregnancy.

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Or you'll hear very often condoms help prevent unwanted pregnancy or the pill helps prevent unwanted pregnancy.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's right.

171
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okay.

172
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So a lot of interesting stuff there.

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think it's worthwhile for us to listen to our dialogue for one last time.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All right.

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Settle down, everyone.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex ed this week.

177
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh, boy.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Now, I want everyone to take this class seriously.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sexual education is very important, and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of.

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

182
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Miss Carlton, what exactly is sexual education?

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you going to teach us like Kama Sutra and stuff like that?

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex ed is.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male and female bodies work.

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My older sister is in college, and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Good point, Jason.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Another popular method is using condoms.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, Jason?

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What are condoms made out of?

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

197
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

198
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
All right, so coming back.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We obviously didn't cover all forms of contraception and forms of protecting yourself against STDs, but I remember very clearly in school when we talked about this, they said the best protection, the best way to not get pregnant or to get STDs is celibacy.

201
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Celibacy is not having any sex.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
When I was in school, they said the safest sex is no sex, because there's always a little bit of danger.

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So this is something that I think they tell a lot of young people to scare them, but there is some truth to it.

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, of course.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now, what do you think about this topic?

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Do you think it's worthwhile and we should teach children sexual education, or many people protest against it and say, this is wrong, we shouldn't be giving kids condoms when they're in high school?

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, personally, I think that kids in most parts of the world will have sex whether or not you tell them not to.

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And so because of that, because everyone's going to, there are always going to be people trying it.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think it's important to inform students and inform kids who are in high school of options and of safety and of important health measures, because otherwise you risk unwanted pregnancies and you risk people getting these very serious diseases like AIDS.

211
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's right.

212
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I think it is a very important topic.

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Some countries or some places, even within the United States, are a little bit more conservative than others.

214
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And so many times they are against this type of education.

215
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I've actually encountered people who never received sexual education and well, until they were maybe like 18, they thought they can get pregnant by a kiss.

216
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So I think that's one of the dangers.

218
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Obviously, there are both sides to this issue and we're curious to know what you think.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Do you think that sex ed should be a course or should be something that people talk about in schools in high school or in college?

220
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Do they do this in your home country?

221
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let us know.

222
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

223
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All right.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We'll see you guys there.

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Bye.

226
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Bye.
