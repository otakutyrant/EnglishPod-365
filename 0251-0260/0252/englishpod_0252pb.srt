00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,160
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,879
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:12,500
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking about something that's very common in high schools all across the English-speaking world.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,380
That's right.

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,660
Today we are going to talk a little bit about sexual education, or also called sex-ed.

6
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:26,379
So you may be asking yourself what exactly this means, so let's take a look at this word on vocabulary preview.

7
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:28,820
Vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,820
Okay, so more commonly than not, we're going to hear the phrase sex-ed, E-D, that stands for education.

9
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:43,899
This is basically a class or a training about sexuality and safety when it comes to these issues.

10
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:44,939
That's right.

11
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:53,060
So as you said, this is a very common class that is part of the school curriculum in English-speaking countries.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,579
I think maybe students are about 16 to 15, 16 years old when they get sex-ed.

13
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,619
We had it when I was about 13, 14.

14
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,399
13, 14.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,820
So it all depends.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,780
Now, many countries don't really have this in their public schools.

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,420
Other countries only have it in private schools.

18
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:17,459
So it's a very controversial topic about if schools should actually be teaching this, but we'll talk about that a little bit later on.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,319
Why don't we take a look at today's dialogue?

20
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:22,719
Let's listen to what's happening today.

21
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,340
All right, settle down, everyone.

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,560
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex-ed this week.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,519
Oh, boy.

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,120
Yeah.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,420
Now, I want everyone to take this class seriously.

26
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,959
Sexual education is very important, and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of.

27
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,400
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,640
Ms.

29
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,420
Carlton, what exactly is sexual education?

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,239
Are you going to teach us, like, Kamasutra and stuff like that?

31
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,560
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex-ed is.

32
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:12,120
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male and female bodies work.

33
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,419
My older sister is in college, and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,439
I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.

35
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,699
Good point, Jason.

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,979
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,599
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

38
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:40,020
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

39
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,520
Another popular method is using condoms.

40
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:50,319
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

41
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,939
Yes, Jason?

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,060
What are condoms made out of?

43
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,780
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

44
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,919
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

45
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,340
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,659
All right, we're back.

47
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:18,199
Now I'm sure there are a couple of words that we didn't really understand there, so let's take a look at a couple of them on language takeaway.

48
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,659
Language takeaway.

49
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:32,860
One of the most common phrases you're going to hear when it comes to sex and safety when you're having sex is sexually transmitted disease, or STD.

50
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,819
That's right.

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:44,520
The teacher actually mentioned the whole name, sexually transmitted diseases, and also she used the acronym STDs, or STD in STD.

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,180
What exactly are these STDs?

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,080
The key word here is disease.

54
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,840
These are illnesses that you can get from sex.

55
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:07,259
Sexually transmitted means transmitted or passed on from one person to another person during sex, and this could include any kind of diseases like AIDS, or syphilis, or chlamydia, or gonorrhea.

56
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Those are the most famous ones.

57
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:08,960
That's right.

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,780
So sexually transmitted diseases.

59
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,300
Now why don't we get into the title of our lesson today, contraceptives.

60
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,079
What are these contraceptives?

61
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:26,360
Okay, so teachers are always going to explain the big difference between protection and contraception or contraceptives.

62
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,319
Basically contraceptives have to do with getting pregnant.

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:38,360
If you don't want your girlfriend to get pregnant and you're a guy, or if you're a girl and you don't want to get pregnant, you take contraceptives or you use contraceptives.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:47,120
There are many different kinds, and I think the most common kind for preventing a pregnancy or making sure you don't get pregnant is something called the pill.

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:47,959
That's right.

66
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,040
One of the kids said that his sister takes the pill.

67
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Now this is called the pill.

68
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,899
Now you know that pills are any type of a capsule or little medicine that you swallow with water, but what is the pill?

69
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,100
Well this is the birth control pill.

70
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:05,740
So that's a long name.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
People often in conversation just say the pill, but it's called the birth control pill, and it's a pill that women take every day, or some of them different times, to prevent pregnancy.

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
And so that means that you're trying not to get pregnant.

73
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:19,879
That's right.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,319
Okay, so this is called a contraceptive.

75
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:40,220
Now as you mentioned, this is a contraceptive, so it will prevent you from getting pregnant, but it will not protect you, and as many of you may know, the most common form of protection against pregnancy and STDs are a little device called a condom.

76
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:49,699
Okay so a condom is, like you said, the most common kind of protection that people use, and it's important because it helps you not only not get pregnant, but also not get a disease.

77
00:05:50,060 --> 00:06:03,040
And so people often talk about this as being the most important kind of protection from disease and pregnancy, and it's basically just a cover for a man's penis, and it prevents liquids being passed on from one person to another person.

78
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,100
That's right, and actually as you mentioned, this has to do with our next word.

79
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,680
It prevents you from contracting STDs, like the teacher mentioned.

80
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,019
So to contract an STD, or to contract an illness, what does that mean?

81
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:23,079
Well, contract is a special verb that we use when we're talking about getting a disease.

82
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,600
You don't say, I got a disease, you say, I contracted it.

83
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,220
That means I got it from somewhere or someone, and that's one of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.

84
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,120
You can contract very serious diseases just by having sex.

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,399
Now can I say, I contracted the flu?

86
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,779
I mean, it's not incorrect, but we don't really say that with the flu.

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,139
It's not a very serious illness.

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,680
You say it with very serious illnesses.

89
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,860
So yeah, I don't think you would go around saying, oh, I contracted a cold last week.

90
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:55,740
I got the cold.

91
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,660
And you wouldn't say this about cancer either, because cancer is not something you get from someone else.

92
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:06,160
But you say he contracted AIDS, or he contracted gonorrhea, for example.

93
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,339
Okay, very good.

94
00:07:07,579 --> 00:07:13,660
So as you see, the spelling is actually the same as a contract, like an agreement between a company or two people.

95
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,480
But the accent is different.

96
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:21,399
A contract is an agreement to contract that, what we're talking about, illnesses.

97
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,259
To get.

98
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,500
All right, very good.

99
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,699
And for our final word, we're going back to condoms.

100
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,620
The material that they are made out of is called latex.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,199
Okay, so latex is a very special kind of material that is, like they say in the dialogue, elastic.

102
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,399
It's stretchy.

103
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,259
And it's almost plasticky, but it's very, very tough.

104
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,699
It's very strong, and that's why they make condoms out of it.

105
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,920
And I think we also see things made out of latex, for example.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,879
Doctors, when they're operating, they wear latex gloves.

107
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:54,920
That's right.

108
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:02,500
Obviously, they don't want to use materials that are weak or that are thin, because they need to protect their patients from germs.

109
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,040
And so latex gloves and latex condoms are very, very common, because they are so durable.

110
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,959
That's right.

111
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,019
Great.

112
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:09,439
Okay.

113
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,420
So a lot of interesting stuff there.

114
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,279
Why don't we now jump on over and take a look at a couple of different phrases on Fluency Builder.

115
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,139
Fluency Builder.

116
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,339
So this first phrase is something you should be very, very familiar with if you've ever been in a classroom in America or Canada.

117
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,500
Oftentimes with younger children or with high school children, people get really worked up, very excited.

118
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,700
Kids are yelling and talking, and they're giggling, and they think that, oh, sex is so funny.

119
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,960
And so the teacher always says, settle down.

120
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:40,740
Settle down.

121
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:41,220
Okay.

122
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:44,820
So if somebody tells you to settle down, hey, hey, settle down, settle down.

123
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,740
That means calm down.

124
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,299
Be quiet.

125
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,200
You're too excited.

126
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,039
Calm down.

127
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,360
So you can use this with your kids.

128
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,299
Maybe settle down.

129
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:52,879
We need to go.

130
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,220
Come on.

131
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:53,779
Get in the car.

132
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,399
That's right.

133
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:56,120
So just kind of be quiet.

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,440
Be a little bit calmer.

135
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,519
It's a very, very, very important phrase, especially if you're talking to younger people.

136
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:02,139
Okay.

137
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:10,960
And well, of course, when you're talking about sex with teenagers or younger people, everyone's laughing and giggling because it's such a weird thing for them.

138
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,720
And the teacher said, I really want you to take this class seriously.

139
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,600
Okay.

140
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:18,960
So take this class seriously.

141
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,700
This comes from a sentence structure that's very, very important to take something seriously.

142
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,279
I take my studies very seriously.

143
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,659
Or you guys should take this class seriously.

144
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:30,340
It's important.

145
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,419
It means, listen, pay attention.

146
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,679
This is important, and you need to know this.

147
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,659
It's kind of like a way to instruct someone to really pay attention.

148
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,179
That's right.

149
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,179
Or what if you say, I want you to take me seriously?

150
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:50,480
That means I want you to really think about what I'm saying and not just talk to me like I don't really understand what's going on.

151
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:50,879
Okay.

152
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,460
Very good.

153
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,360
So to take something seriously is the structure.

154
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,039
Now moving on to our final phrase.

155
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,279
When we were talking again about contraceptives, we talked about avoiding pregnancy.

156
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,419
And we have a phrase that we use called unwanted pregnancy.

157
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,379
So pregnancy is what happens when someone gets pregnant.

158
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:12,720
They're going to have a baby.

159
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,679
But an unwanted pregnancy is a certain kind of pregnancy.

160
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,840
It means when someone did not plan to get pregnant or did not want to get pregnant.

161
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:22,899
So unwanted is the opposite of wanted.

162
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
It means like it was an accident.

163
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,879
So you wouldn't really say an accidental pregnancy because it, you know.

164
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,779
It's still a kid.

165
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:30,559
Exactly.

166
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:30,759
Exactly.

167
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,759
So you didn't want to get pregnant, but you did.

168
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,759
That's why we say unwanted pregnancy.

169
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:44,200
Or you'll hear very often condoms help prevent unwanted pregnancy or the pill helps prevent unwanted pregnancy.

170
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:44,940
That's right.

171
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:45,600
Okay.

172
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,179
So a lot of interesting stuff there.

173
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,759
I think it's worthwhile for us to listen to our dialogue for one last time.

174
00:10:59,139 --> 00:10:59,960
All right.

175
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,100
Settle down, everyone.

176
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,299
As part of this school's curriculum, we'll be covering sex ed this week.

177
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,279
Oh, boy.

178
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:07,919
Yeah.

179
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,179
Now, I want everyone to take this class seriously.

180
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,799
Sexual education is very important, and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of.

181
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,299
Remember, there are no stupid questions here.

182
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,179
Miss Carlton, what exactly is sexual education?

183
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,019
Are you going to teach us like Kama Sutra and stuff like that?

184
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,340
No, Jason, that's not actually what sex ed is.

185
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,860
Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives, and how the male and female bodies work.

186
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,179
My older sister is in college, and she takes what she and her friends call the pill.

187
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,200
I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.

188
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,440
Good point, Jason.

189
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,740
This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives.

190
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,340
As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist.

191
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:08,779
The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STDs from an infected person.

192
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,279
Another popular method is using condoms.

193
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:19,080
This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant, but also protects you from STDs.

194
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,700
Yes, Jason?

195
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,820
What are condoms made out of?

196
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:25,519
How is it exactly that a woman gets pregnant?

197
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,679
Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called latex.

198
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,080
As for your other question, that's a whole new class.

199
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,240
All right, so coming back.

200
00:12:43,919 --> 00:13:00,779
We obviously didn't cover all forms of contraception and forms of protecting yourself against STDs, but I remember very clearly in school when we talked about this, they said the best protection, the best way to not get pregnant or to get STDs is celibacy.

201
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:01,759
That's right.

202
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,899
Celibacy is not having any sex.

203
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:10,179
When I was in school, they said the safest sex is no sex, because there's always a little bit of danger.

204
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,600
So this is something that I think they tell a lot of young people to scare them, but there is some truth to it.

205
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,279
Yeah, of course.

206
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,759
Now, what do you think about this topic?

207
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:30,799
Do you think it's worthwhile and we should teach children sexual education, or many people protest against it and say, this is wrong, we shouldn't be giving kids condoms when they're in high school?

208
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,259
Well, personally, I think that kids in most parts of the world will have sex whether or not you tell them not to.

209
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,480
And so because of that, because everyone's going to, there are always going to be people trying it.

210
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:59,259
I think it's important to inform students and inform kids who are in high school of options and of safety and of important health measures, because otherwise you risk unwanted pregnancies and you risk people getting these very serious diseases like AIDS.

211
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,139
That's right.

212
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,419
I think it is a very important topic.

213
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:09,080
Some countries or some places, even within the United States, are a little bit more conservative than others.

214
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,639
And so many times they are against this type of education.

215
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:22,419
But I've actually encountered people who never received sexual education and well, until they were maybe like 18, they thought they can get pregnant by a kiss.

216
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:22,980
Yeah.

217
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,980
So I think that's one of the dangers.

218
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,519
Obviously, there are both sides to this issue and we're curious to know what you think.

219
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,759
Do you think that sex ed should be a course or should be something that people talk about in schools in high school or in college?

220
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,720
Do they do this in your home country?

221
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,220
Let us know.

222
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,820
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

223
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:40,200
All right.

224
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:40,860
We'll see you guys there.

225
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,200
Bye.

226
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:41,460
Bye.
