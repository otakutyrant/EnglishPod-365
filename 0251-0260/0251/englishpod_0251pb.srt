00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,619
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking a little bit about, well, kind of girly things.

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:11,400
That's right.

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,460
We've talked about guys' shoes, women's shoes.

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,300
So now we're going to talk about another aspect of women's accessories.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,579
We're going to talk about makeup.

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:21,539
Okay.

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,879
So we're wearing makeup today.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,760
Actually, we're buying makeup at the store.

11
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,019
I never even knew there were so many kinds of makeups.

12
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,199
First we're going to learn all about these in today's dialogue.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,280
I'm hungry.

14
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,640
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,780
Yeah, me too.

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,960
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,020
I lost my makeup bag at the airport, and I want to pick up a few things.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,140
Will you take long?

19
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:47,840
No.

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,840
Five minutes.

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,600
I promise.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,500
Come on.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,079
We've been here for almost an hour.

24
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,359
I thought you said you were only going to get a few things.

25
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,520
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

26
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:02,520
Are you crazy?

27
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,140
You have no idea what you're talking about.

28
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:12,019
Just for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil, and mascara.

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,159
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

30
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:16,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,620
Are you nuts?

32
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:19,700
How much is all this going to cost?

33
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,879
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things, and it's outrageous.

34
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,939
This is basically a crayon.

35
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,180
What about you?

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,439
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne, and gel.

37
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,780
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and- Fine.

38
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,700
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,659
All right, we're back.

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,599
Obviously, we're getting a lot of things for this girl, a lot of makeup.

41
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,959
I think there are a couple of things that we may not know about, so let's take a look at them now on Language Takeaway.

42
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,519
Language Takeaway.

43
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,260
The first thing we're talking about today is a basic.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
Most women carry this around in their purses.

45
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:04,859
It's called lipstick.

46
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,379
That's right, and as you said, this is a pretty basic thing.

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:14,560
It's the kind of like paint that you put on your lips, and it's called a lipstick because it looks like a little stick.

48
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,240
Right, and you turn it with your fingers, and it comes up, and then you turn it again, and it goes down, basically keeping it from touching all of the things in your purse.

49
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:33,300
That's right, so lipstick, and well, apart from this, we also have nail polish, and this is also very popular with the ladies when you paint your nails a certain color.

50
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,219
That's right, so polish is basically anything that makes something shiny.

51
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:47,740
It's something that you add to surfaces, so you could add polish to wood on a table, but in this case, we're putting it on our nails, that is fingernails or toenails, so it's nail polish.

52
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,680
All right, very good, and now we're getting into the specific things.

53
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,199
A lot of makeup that women use on their eyes, so for example, the first thing she said, she needs to get an eyeliner.

54
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,159
Okay, so eyeliner is basically a pencil.

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,439
This is what the guy is making fun of her about.

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:15,620
He says it's just a pencil or a crayon for your eye, and so basically, you use it to draw a line on the top or the bottom of your eye, your eyelid.

57
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:24,439
Okay, so yeah, it kind of looks like a marker, and it comes, I think, black in different colors, and then you paint little lines around your eyes to make them more pronounced.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,039
So it's called an eyeliner.

59
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:31,599
Okay, and now we have an eyelash curler, and also, I think this is very important for the ladies.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,539
Yeah, well, not everyone uses this.

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,840
It's a little bit of a scary instrument.

62
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,639
It looks like it might pop your eye out.

63
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:51,120
It's something you use on your eyelashes, so those are the hairs that come off of your eye, and basically, you use this to make them curly or to make them seem a bit longer and prettier.

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,319
So an eyelash curler is something that, it's almost like a press or something for your eyelashes.

65
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:05,960
Okay, very good, and well, now that we've got that covered, we move on to eyeshadow, and I think this goes on your eyelid, right?

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,580
That's right.

67
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,000
Some people make it go further.

68
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,419
They put it on their face above their eyelid, but that's a little bit crazy.

69
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:18,519
I think eyeshadow generally goes, like you said, on your eyelid, and it can be in many different colors, so blue, pink, red, whatever.

70
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,079
People sometimes go crazy with eyeshadow.

71
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,660
Okay, and now what about an eyebrow pencil?

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,920
This is basically a pencil for filling in or for coloring your eyebrows.

73
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,060
Sometimes people like to make their eyebrows look darker or thicker, and so they use this pencil.

74
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,220
It's usually brown or black, and they use it on their eyebrows.

75
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,839
So we've picked up a lot of vocab here related to your eye.

76
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,819
For example, an eyelash, your eyelid.

77
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:56,720
Now we're talking about the eyebrows, which are the hairs on top, more or less around your forehead, and now we also have another type of makeup called mascara.

78
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,959
This is another basic, so like we said earlier, lipstick is something you almost always find in a woman's purse.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,879
Well, mascara is another one of those things.

80
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,379
Almost everybody wears mascara.

81
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,759
This is kind of like a brush for your eyelashes, and it paints them a different color.

82
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,759
So most women wear black or brown, and it makes your eyelashes look really long.

83
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,540
Oh, okay.

84
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:18,379
Very good.

85
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,620
So this is kind of like paint for your eyelashes.

86
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,660
And now moving away from your eyelashes, we're going to have, we're buying also some foundation and liquid foundation.

87
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,579
Okay, so foundation is just a kind of base for your face.

88
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,360
So foundation, like a building, is the very bottom.

89
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:49,620
Well, in this case, it's something that you put on your cheeks, on your face in general, on your forehead, to kind of smooth your skin out and make it look all the same color, the same texture.

90
00:05:50,060 --> 00:06:00,399
And so foundation can be, like we see here, either a powder, which is kind of like a dry substance, or you can use liquid foundation, which is, like it says, liquid.

91
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:02,139
It's almost like a thick cream.

92
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:13,220
All right, so foundation is, as you said, I guess you just want to make your skin look the same color, the same texture, because obviously not everyone's skin is perfect.

93
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,920
We all have some spots, maybe, or some different color on our face.

94
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,879
You say we, like you wear foundation, too.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,699
Do you wear makeup, Marco?

96
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:28,439
Well, I mean, we as people, because, you know, all right, no, no, no, no, none of this makeup for me, although I have used an eyelash curler once.

97
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,420
That's scary.

98
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,680
Well, my friends dared me to, so okay.

99
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,319
And you loved it.

100
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:32,920
Of course.

101
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,120
Now I use it all the time.

102
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,660
No, no.

103
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:39,160
But what I do use is now things related to guys.

104
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,800
So for example, the girlfriend was saying, well, you buy razors and aftershave.

105
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,199
So what are these things?

106
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,060
Well, razors aren't just a guy thing.

107
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,339
Everyone can have a razor.

108
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:55,279
It's basically a blade, like a very sharp piece of metal that you use to cut hair.

109
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:00,420
So the hair on your legs, the hair on your face, these are things that you cut with a razor.

110
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,459
And men use razors to shave their faces, shave their chins or above their lip.

111
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,240
All right.

112
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:15,819
And well, actually, after we shave our beard, we put on a little bit of aftershave, which is basically kind of like alcohol that smells really nice.

113
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:16,560
That's right.

114
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,800
Because shaving can actually hurt your skin or the hairs under your skin can become really itchy or irritated.

115
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,579
And so aftershave helps make everything feel better.

116
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,240
And well, sometimes we also use a little bit of cologne to smell nice.

117
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:42,500
So women usually wear perfume, which is, you know, all the perfumes like CK and Ugo Boss and all that stuff, as well as for guys, it's usually called cologne.

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,399
Okay, that's right.

119
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:49,439
It's an important difference there because we don't say perfume for guys and we don't say cologne for girls.

120
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,079
So women wear perfume, like you said, but men wear cologne.

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,939
And this word is very funny looking.

122
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,600
It ends with, it's spelled C O L O G N E.

123
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,259
So you don't really say the G.

124
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,800
It's not cologna, right?

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,699
It's cologne.

126
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,540
And it's something that you put on your neck or your face to smell really good if you're a man.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,360
Exactly.

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:20,060
And finally, if you have long hair or maybe you have very spiky hair like I do, you need to wear a little bit of gel to kind of give your head a little bit of shape.

129
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,060
That's right.

130
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,699
So gel is actually the name of a kind of substance.

131
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,540
It's not liquid, but it's not hard either.

132
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,300
And it's basically thick like paste that you put in your hair to keep it in one place.

133
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,340
Yeah, it makes your hair become a little bit harder or it keeps your hairstyle in for a long time.

134
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:37,799
That's right.

135
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:37,919
Exactly.

136
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,639
All right.

137
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,240
So a lot of vocab here, a lot of things that we've picked up.

138
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Why don't we go back, review all this great vocab on our dialogue for today.

139
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm hungry.

140
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

141
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,139
Yeah, me too.

142
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,299
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

143
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,340
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

144
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:02,460
Will you take long?

145
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,240
No, five minutes.

146
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:04,940
I promise.

147
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,100
Come on.

148
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,639
We've been here for almost an hour.

149
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,919
I thought you said you're only going to get a few things.

150
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,059
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

151
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:15,080
Are you crazy?

152
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,700
You have no idea what you're talking about.

153
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:24,580
Just for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara.

154
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,720
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

155
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:29,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,200
Are you nuts?

157
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:32,240
How much is all this going to cost?

158
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,419
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

159
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:37,480
This is basically a crayon.

160
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:38,740
What about you?

161
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,000
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne and gel.

162
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:47,480
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and...

163
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:47,740
Fine.

164
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,620
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

165
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,019
All right, we're back.

166
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,299
So now we're going to take a look at three short phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

167
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,980
Fluency Builder.

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:14,659
So this first phrase is something that we almost always say with our friends or family when we're hungry, we're shopping, you know, sometimes you're outside and you just really want to eat, you say, hey, let's grab a bite to eat.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,399
That's right.

170
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,340
So this is a very natural, colloquial way of saying, let's go get something to eat.

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,659
Let's go eat something.

172
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,740
So it could be small, it could be a snack like an ice cream, but it can also be dinner.

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,299
So hey, do you want to go grab a bite to eat sometime?

174
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,580
That means, hey, you want to go have lunch or dinner sometime?

175
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,240
Very good.

176
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,820
So the phrase is grab a bite or go grab a bite to eat.

177
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:45,960
So a bite can be a noun, like a thing, like a piece of food that you eat, but it can also be a verb, to bite, like, you know, the dog bites the man.

178
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:47,419
And so you have to be careful with this one.

179
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,700
In this case, it's a noun.

180
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,820
Okay, very good.

181
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,639
And well, she wanted to first go to the store and she said, I want to pick up a few things.

182
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,919
Well, usually when you pick something up, you take it from a table or from the ground.

183
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,259
But in this case, it means to buy something because you can't just pick something up in a store and then walk away.

184
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,120
You have to pay for it.

185
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,720
So for example, you can say, when you come home, can you pick up a carton of milk?

186
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,759
So that means can you buy some milk on your way home?

187
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,460
It doesn't mean can you take some from someone else or steal some?

188
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,100
Exactly.

189
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,059
All right.

190
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,840
So to pick something up to buy, to go and get, but obviously you have to pay.

191
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,899
All right.

192
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,200
And he used this very interesting phrase when she was getting all these things for her.

193
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,159
He said, whoa, whoa, whoa.

194
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,039
Are you nuts?

195
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,320
Okay.

196
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,120
So nuts is the important word here.

197
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,860
It means crazy or out of your mind.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,559
That's right.

199
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,700
So it's another way of saying crazy.

200
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,759
So if you call someone nuts or you say he's nuts, that means, yeah, like don't talk to him.

201
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,320
He's nuts.

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,519
Or he always says really dangerous things.

203
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,259
He's nuts.

204
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,259
So he's a little bit crazy.

205
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,639
So it's an adjective as to describe someone that's a little bit crazy or a little bit adventurous maybe.

206
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:05,379
But in this case, he's not actually saying she's a crazy person.

207
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,779
He's saying, listen, this is so much stuff.

208
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,639
Are you crazy?

209
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,539
Or he's basically saying, do you really want to do this?

210
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,000
This seems like a bad decision.

211
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:13,860
Exactly.

212
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,820
So that's why he used the phrase, are you nuts?

213
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:17,940
Okay.

214
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,340
So a lot of great stuff there.

215
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,179
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit.

216
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,519
I'm hungry, let's go grab a bite to eat.

217
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:33,639
Yeah, me too.

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,759
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

219
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,820
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

220
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:41,980
Will you take long?

221
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,440
No, five minutes, I promise.

222
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,940
Come on, we've been here for almost an hour.

223
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,179
I thought you said you're only going to get a few things.

224
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,379
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

225
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:57,360
Are you crazy?

226
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,980
You have no idea what you're talking about.

227
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,860
Just for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara.

228
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,000
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

229
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

230
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,460
Are you nuts?

231
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,500
How much is all this going to cost?

232
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

233
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,820
This is basically a crayon.

234
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,000
What about you?

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,279
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne and gel.

236
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,620
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and- Fine.

237
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,480
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

238
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,480
All right, so talking about makeup, a lot of things here.

239
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,379
Maybe I didn't mention a couple of things.

240
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,779
I don't know.

241
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,320
We took a look at the most important things, I think, right?

242
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,120
You also mentioned something, for example, cover up.

243
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,639
There's something, such makeup called cover up.

244
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, so cover up, it could be a couple of different things in English.

245
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,299
For example, something that you wear to cover your body when you're at the beach.

246
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:15,679
You don't want to walk around and everyone can see you in your bathing suit, but when we're talking about makeup, a cover up is a thing that we use to hide blemishes or zits or pimples.

247
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:22,000
So you know when you get a really small red dot on your face and you're embarrassed and it's ugly and you don't want anyone to see it?

248
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:28,419
Well, cover up is a kind of makeup you use that looks like your skin color and you put it on top and you can't see the red anymore.

249
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,779
Okay, so you cover up your pimple.

250
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, or you use cover up.

251
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,759
It's a noun too.

252
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,720
Okay, and I've also seen that, well, many girls don't really wear too much lipstick anymore nowadays.

253
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,000
They use this thing called lip gloss.

254
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,500
Okay, lip gloss.

255
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,220
Remember we were talking about polish earlier?

256
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,139
Well, gloss is a similar word.

257
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,139
It means something that makes another thing shiny.

258
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:02,000
And so lipstick can be very dry, can be very flat, but lip gloss is something that makes things look wet, makes things look shiny.

259
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:11,820
Okay, and actually one last thing before, when we talked about gel, I guess guys use gel, but women use this thing called mousse.

260
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,279
Or they could use gel too.

261
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,679
I don't think it's gender specific, but a lot of people use mousse.

262
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,399
I know some men who use mousse as well.

263
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,279
Mousse is kind of like a foam.

264
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:26,259
You know, it comes in a can and it goes, yeah, and it like inflates this white substance.

265
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,759
Yeah, it looks like, I don't know, like whipped cream.

266
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:30,700
Like whipped cream, yeah.

267
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,200
And you put it in your hair and it's very fluffy and it's actually less strong.

268
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:43,279
It's not like gel because if you put it in your hair, your hair won't look hard, but it will help shape your hair if you want to keep your hair in one place.

269
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,879
A lot of things here.

270
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:52,600
I think in beauty and cosmetics, we have a lot of, a lot of things and probably we didn't even touch on half of the things that are out there.

271
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:02,200
