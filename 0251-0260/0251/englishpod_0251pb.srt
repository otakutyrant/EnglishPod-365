00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we're talking a little bit about, well, kind of girly things.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've talked about guys' shoes, women's shoes.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So now we're going to talk about another aspect of women's accessories.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're going to talk about makeup.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So we're wearing makeup today.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Actually, we're buying makeup at the store.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I never even knew there were so many kinds of makeups.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First we're going to learn all about these in today's dialogue.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm hungry.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, me too.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I lost my makeup bag at the airport, and I want to pick up a few things.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Will you take long?

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Five minutes.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I promise.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Come on.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We've been here for almost an hour.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I thought you said you were only going to get a few things.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you crazy?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You have no idea what you're talking about.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Just for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil, and mascara.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are you nuts?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How much is all this going to cost?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things, and it's outrageous.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is basically a crayon.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What about you?

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne, and gel.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and- Fine.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right, we're back.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Obviously, we're getting a lot of things for this girl, a lot of makeup.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think there are a couple of things that we may not know about, so let's take a look at them now on Language Takeaway.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Language Takeaway.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The first thing we're talking about today is a basic.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Most women carry this around in their purses.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's called lipstick.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right, and as you said, this is a pretty basic thing.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's the kind of like paint that you put on your lips, and it's called a lipstick because it looks like a little stick.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right, and you turn it with your fingers, and it comes up, and then you turn it again, and it goes down, basically keeping it from touching all of the things in your purse.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right, so lipstick, and well, apart from this, we also have nail polish, and this is also very popular with the ladies when you paint your nails a certain color.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right, so polish is basically anything that makes something shiny.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's something that you add to surfaces, so you could add polish to wood on a table, but in this case, we're putting it on our nails, that is fingernails or toenails, so it's nail polish.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All right, very good, and now we're getting into the specific things.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A lot of makeup that women use on their eyes, so for example, the first thing she said, she needs to get an eyeliner.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, so eyeliner is basically a pencil.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is what the guy is making fun of her about.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He says it's just a pencil or a crayon for your eye, and so basically, you use it to draw a line on the top or the bottom of your eye, your eyelid.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, so yeah, it kind of looks like a marker, and it comes, I think, black in different colors, and then you paint little lines around your eyes to make them more pronounced.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So it's called an eyeliner.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, and now we have an eyelash curler, and also, I think this is very important for the ladies.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, well, not everyone uses this.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a little bit of a scary instrument.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It looks like it might pop your eye out.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's something you use on your eyelashes, so those are the hairs that come off of your eye, and basically, you use this to make them curly or to make them seem a bit longer and prettier.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So an eyelash curler is something that, it's almost like a press or something for your eyelashes.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay, very good, and well, now that we've got that covered, we move on to eyeshadow, and I think this goes on your eyelid, right?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Some people make it go further.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They put it on their face above their eyelid, but that's a little bit crazy.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think eyeshadow generally goes, like you said, on your eyelid, and it can be in many different colors, so blue, pink, red, whatever.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
People sometimes go crazy with eyeshadow.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, and now what about an eyebrow pencil?

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is basically a pencil for filling in or for coloring your eyebrows.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sometimes people like to make their eyebrows look darker or thicker, and so they use this pencil.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's usually brown or black, and they use it on their eyebrows.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So we've picked up a lot of vocab here related to your eye.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For example, an eyelash, your eyelid.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Now we're talking about the eyebrows, which are the hairs on top, more or less around your forehead, and now we also have another type of makeup called mascara.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is another basic, so like we said earlier, lipstick is something you almost always find in a woman's purse.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, mascara is another one of those things.

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Almost everybody wears mascara.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is kind of like a brush for your eyelashes, and it paints them a different color.

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So most women wear black or brown, and it makes your eyelashes look really long.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, okay.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Very good.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So this is kind of like paint for your eyelashes.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And now moving away from your eyelashes, we're going to have, we're buying also some foundation and liquid foundation.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Okay, so foundation is just a kind of base for your face.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So foundation, like a building, is the very bottom.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, in this case, it's something that you put on your cheeks, on your face in general, on your forehead, to kind of smooth your skin out and make it look all the same color, the same texture.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And so foundation can be, like we see here, either a powder, which is kind of like a dry substance, or you can use liquid foundation, which is, like it says, liquid.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's almost like a thick cream.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:13,000
All right, so foundation is, as you said, I guess you just want to make your skin look the same color, the same texture, because obviously not everyone's skin is perfect.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We all have some spots, maybe, or some different color on our face.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You say we, like you wear foundation, too.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you wear makeup, Marco?

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, I mean, we as people, because, you know, all right, no, no, no, no, none of this makeup for me, although I have used an eyelash curler once.

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's scary.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well, my friends dared me to, so okay.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And you loved it.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Of course.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Now I use it all the time.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, no.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But what I do use is now things related to guys.

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So for example, the girlfriend was saying, well, you buy razors and aftershave.

105
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So what are these things?

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, razors aren't just a guy thing.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Everyone can have a razor.

108
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's basically a blade, like a very sharp piece of metal that you use to cut hair.

109
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So the hair on your legs, the hair on your face, these are things that you cut with a razor.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And men use razors to shave their faces, shave their chins or above their lip.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
All right.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And well, actually, after we shave our beard, we put on a little bit of aftershave, which is basically kind of like alcohol that smells really nice.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's right.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Because shaving can actually hurt your skin or the hairs under your skin can become really itchy or irritated.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And so aftershave helps make everything feel better.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And well, sometimes we also use a little bit of cologne to smell nice.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So women usually wear perfume, which is, you know, all the perfumes like CK and Ugo Boss and all that stuff, as well as for guys, it's usually called cologne.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Okay, that's right.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's an important difference there because we don't say perfume for guys and we don't say cologne for girls.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So women wear perfume, like you said, but men wear cologne.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And this word is very funny looking.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It ends with, it's spelled C O L O G N E.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So you don't really say the G.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not cologna, right?

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's cologne.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And it's something that you put on your neck or your face to smell really good if you're a man.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Exactly.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And finally, if you have long hair or maybe you have very spiky hair like I do, you need to wear a little bit of gel to kind of give your head a little bit of shape.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So gel is actually the name of a kind of substance.

131
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not liquid, but it's not hard either.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And it's basically thick like paste that you put in your hair to keep it in one place.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, it makes your hair become a little bit harder or it keeps your hairstyle in for a long time.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's right.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Exactly.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All right.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So a lot of vocab here, a lot of things that we've picked up.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why don't we go back, review all this great vocab on our dialogue for today.

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm hungry.

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's go grab a bite to eat.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yeah, me too.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Will you take long?

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, five minutes.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I promise.

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come on.

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We've been here for almost an hour.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I thought you said you're only going to get a few things.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you crazy?

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have no idea what you're talking about.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Just for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you nuts?

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How much is all this going to cost?

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is basically a crayon.

160
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What about you?

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne and gel.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and...

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Fine.

164
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All right, we're back.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So now we're going to take a look at three short phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Fluency Builder.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So this first phrase is something that we almost always say with our friends or family when we're hungry, we're shopping, you know, sometimes you're outside and you just really want to eat, you say, hey, let's grab a bite to eat.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's right.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So this is a very natural, colloquial way of saying, let's go get something to eat.

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's go eat something.

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So it could be small, it could be a snack like an ice cream, but it can also be dinner.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So hey, do you want to go grab a bite to eat sometime?

174
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That means, hey, you want to go have lunch or dinner sometime?

175
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Very good.

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So the phrase is grab a bite or go grab a bite to eat.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So a bite can be a noun, like a thing, like a piece of food that you eat, but it can also be a verb, to bite, like, you know, the dog bites the man.

178
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And so you have to be careful with this one.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
In this case, it's a noun.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, very good.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And well, she wanted to first go to the store and she said, I want to pick up a few things.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, usually when you pick something up, you take it from a table or from the ground.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But in this case, it means to buy something because you can't just pick something up in a store and then walk away.

184
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You have to pay for it.

185
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So for example, you can say, when you come home, can you pick up a carton of milk?

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So that means can you buy some milk on your way home?

187
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It doesn't mean can you take some from someone else or steal some?

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Exactly.

189
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
All right.

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So to pick something up to buy, to go and get, but obviously you have to pay.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
All right.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And he used this very interesting phrase when she was getting all these things for her.

193
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He said, whoa, whoa, whoa.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Are you nuts?

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Okay.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So nuts is the important word here.

197
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It means crazy or out of your mind.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So it's another way of saying crazy.

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So if you call someone nuts or you say he's nuts, that means, yeah, like don't talk to him.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He's nuts.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Or he always says really dangerous things.

203
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He's nuts.

204
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So he's a little bit crazy.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So it's an adjective as to describe someone that's a little bit crazy or a little bit adventurous maybe.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But in this case, he's not actually saying she's a crazy person.

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He's saying, listen, this is so much stuff.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you crazy?

209
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Or he's basically saying, do you really want to do this?

210
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
This seems like a bad decision.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Exactly.

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So that's why he used the phrase, are you nuts?

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Okay.

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So a lot of great stuff there.

215
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue for the last time and we'll be back in a bit.

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm hungry, let's go grab a bite to eat.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, me too.

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, can we stop at the shop really fast?

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Will you take long?

221
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, five minutes, I promise.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Come on, we've been here for almost an hour.

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I thought you said you're only going to get a few things.

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish?

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are you crazy?

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You have no idea what you're talking about.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Just for my eyes, I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara.

228
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you nuts?

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How much is all this going to cost?

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm looking at the price of each one of these little things and it's outrageous.

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
This is basically a crayon.

234
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What about you?

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You spend as much money or more on your razors, aftershave, cologne and gel.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and- Fine.

237
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Get the stupid $30 crayon.

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All right, so talking about makeup, a lot of things here.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Maybe I didn't mention a couple of things.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We took a look at the most important things, I think, right?

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You also mentioned something, for example, cover up.

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There's something, such makeup called cover up.

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah, so cover up, it could be a couple of different things in English.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
For example, something that you wear to cover your body when you're at the beach.

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You don't want to walk around and everyone can see you in your bathing suit, but when we're talking about makeup, a cover up is a thing that we use to hide blemishes or zits or pimples.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So you know when you get a really small red dot on your face and you're embarrassed and it's ugly and you don't want anyone to see it?

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, cover up is a kind of makeup you use that looks like your skin color and you put it on top and you can't see the red anymore.

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Okay, so you cover up your pimple.

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, or you use cover up.

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a noun too.

252
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay, and I've also seen that, well, many girls don't really wear too much lipstick anymore nowadays.

253
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They use this thing called lip gloss.

254
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay, lip gloss.

255
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Remember we were talking about polish earlier?

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, gloss is a similar word.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It means something that makes another thing shiny.

258
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And so lipstick can be very dry, can be very flat, but lip gloss is something that makes things look wet, makes things look shiny.

259
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Okay, and actually one last thing before, when we talked about gel, I guess guys use gel, but women use this thing called mousse.

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Or they could use gel too.

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't think it's gender specific, but a lot of people use mousse.

262
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I know some men who use mousse as well.

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Mousse is kind of like a foam.

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You know, it comes in a can and it goes, yeah, and it like inflates this white substance.

265
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yeah, it looks like, I don't know, like whipped cream.

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like whipped cream, yeah.

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And you put it in your hair and it's very fluffy and it's actually less strong.

268
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's not like gel because if you put it in your hair, your hair won't look hard, but it will help shape your hair if you want to keep your hair in one place.

269
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
A lot of things here.

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think in beauty and cosmetics, we have a lot of, a lot of things and probably we didn't even touch on half of the things that are out there.

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:02,000
