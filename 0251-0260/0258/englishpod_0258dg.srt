00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:14,400
EnglishPod.com Do you know what time it is?

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,140
Um, ten?

3
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,100
Get in this door, young man.

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,059
It's midnight.

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,359
You are two hours past curfew.

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,399
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,480
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn't leave the party.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,539
I don't care.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,980
You are grounded for life, mister.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,359
Mom, that is so unfair.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,219
You know the rules and you broke them.

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,000
No allowance and no TV for a week.

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:43,659
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

14
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,479
What?

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,619
For being a couple of hours late?

16
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,320
You have to be kidding.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,960
I don't want to hear it.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,100
Now go to your room.
