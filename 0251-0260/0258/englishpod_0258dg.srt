00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:14,000
EnglishPod.com Do you know what time it is?

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Um, ten?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Get in this door, young man.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's midnight.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You are two hours past curfew.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn't leave the party.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't care.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You are grounded for life, mister.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Mom, that is so unfair.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You know the rules and you broke them.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No allowance and no TV for a week.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For being a couple of hours late?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You have to be kidding.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't want to hear it.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now go to your room.
