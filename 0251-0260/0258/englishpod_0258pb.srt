00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we have a lesson for you all about life at home and life with your parents.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We've all lived with our parents when we were younger, or maybe we still do.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And of course, they have certain rules in the house.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And well, when you break those rules, something happens.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are consequences, and that's what's happening in today's dialogue.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So let's take a listen to this dialogue.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And when we come back, we'll be talking more about what's going on and what some of these words and phrases mean.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do you know what time it is?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Um, 10?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Get in this door, young man.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's midnight.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You are two hours past curfew.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't care.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You are grounded for life, mister.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mom, that is so unfair.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You know the rules, and you broke them.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No allowance and no TV for a week.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For being a couple of hours late?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You have to be kidding.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't want to hear it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now go to your room.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alright, we're back.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So a very typical case, somebody or the kid returns home, it's too late, and now they're in trouble.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes, his parents are not very happy.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In this case, it's his mom who is telling him what the consequences will be.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So let's take a look at language takeaway and find out what some of these keywords are.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Language takeaway.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Alright, so the first word that we're going to take a look at is actually something that his mom said, and he said that you are two hours past curfew.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Curfew.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So curfew has to do specifically with the time when your parents expect you at home.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's right.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So if your curfew is 10 o'clock, you have to be home before or by 10 o'clock.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Right.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So in this case, if the boy's curfew is 10 o'clock and he arrives home at midnight, 12 o'clock, he's two hours past curfew.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And even sometimes cities or governments will implement certain curfews at certain times.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And I don't think adults really have curfews at home.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, I don't think so.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It depends on what you want, but kids definitely have curfews.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What happens, though, Marco, when you break curfew?

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So this is a very serious offense, and you're going to get punished, and the way that we say this, usually parents to their children, you are grounded, or you ground that kid.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
OK, so you might have heard this word when talking about airplanes or flights at an airport.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The plane was grounded.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It basically means it can't go anywhere.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And so when you're talking about a kid or a person, you basically mean, OK, you're grounded.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't go out with your friends.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can't go anywhere.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Usually you can go to school, but you can't have fun is the meaning.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So it's usually a fixed phrase.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're grounded.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That means that you are punished.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can't go out.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But in this case, the mom specified saying you're grounded.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So that means that he can't go out.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But on top of that, she said no allowance and no TV for a week.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, man.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So allowance is the money that your parents give you to go out, like to go to the movies or something.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And your parents might give this to you on a weekly basis.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So every Saturday you get five dollars or on a monthly basis.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Every month you get twenty dollars.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And when his mother says you're not going to have any allowance for a week, that means we're not going to give you any money this week.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So that is an allowance.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How much money you get per month or per week.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The key thing about allowance, though, is that it's not something you do for work.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't work and receive allowance.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you work, you have a salary.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Allowance is something that you get for free from someone.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So you can get an allowance from your boss to eat, but you can also have an allowance for your parents to do fun things.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's right.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So usually kids, obviously, they can't work, so they get an allowance from their parents, usually for fun things like going to the movies and stuff.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Exactly.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now, going back a little bit, let's take a look at two ways that the mom addressed or called her son, because obviously it's her son.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But when he got home, she said, get in this door, young man.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
OK, these are angry mom phrases.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
When you're when you're in trouble, your parents tend to use different words to talk to you.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So this is a very popular one.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Young man.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Right.

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So it's like saying you should be mature, but you made a mistake.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
All right.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So come inside right now, young man.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a it's a it's a way to kind of emphasize that you are also very angry.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And also, when he was trying to explain what happened, she said, I don't care.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're grounded for life, mister.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're grounded for life, mister.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So these are both ways of talking to young boys.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mister is the opposite of Miss.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But in the case of a young girl, you'd say, get in this door, young lady.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Right.

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then you're grounded for life, Missy.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Missy.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah, I think they say Missy.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Missy.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So Missy, Mr.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Young man, young lady.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
These are all ways of referring to people in kind of it's weird.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's kind of like they're adults, but they're not.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah, that's right.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's like saying you're in trouble.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So very interesting things going on here with this young man who got grounded.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why don't we go back?

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's take a look at our dialog again and we'll be back in a bit.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you know what time it is?

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Um, 10.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Get in this door, young man.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's midnight.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You are two hours past curfew.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't care.

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are grounded for life, mister.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mom, that is so unfair.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know the rules and you broke them.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No allowance and no TV for a week.

130
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
For being a couple of hours late?

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have to be kidding.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't want to hear it.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now go to your room.

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,000
All right, we're back.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So now let's take a look at four key phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Fluency Builder.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
All right, so this first phrase is something that actually we hear when the young boy or the young man is giving his excuse for being late.

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He said, listen, I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10.

141
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's right.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So the phrasal verb there is to drop off.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This means to leave someone somewhere.

144
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But usually it means to drive someone to a certain place.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So for example, Jennifer probably has a car and Jennifer was supposed to take this boy home.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So he said she was going to drop me off before 10 o'clock.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That means kind of leave her, leave him at his house.

149
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So the verb is to drop off, but we usually insert the subject in between it.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So to drop me off.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
She is going to drop me off.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I dropped him off at the bank.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's right.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
All right, so now that Jennifer was supposed to drop him off at 10, that didn't happen.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So he got grounded and his mom was saying that she usually doesn't really ground him, but this time I have to put my foot down.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She's angry.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He's upset and she's angry and she said, listen, I have to put my foot down.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What does this mean?

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You put your foot on the ground?

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's strange to hear this phrase.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It means that she's going to be strict, that she's not going to let him just get away with it or not ground him.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She really has to be strict and she has to punish him.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, so to put your foot down or I put my foot down.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This means to be strict with someone, to not maybe bend the rules or be flexible.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So for example, my mother was always very, very loose with my brother.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He could do what he wanted or whatever, but one day he did something really horrible and she finally put her foot down and she grounded him.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
She grounded him for three months.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
All right, so that's what happens when somebody puts their foot down.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And now obviously he was very surprised that he's going to be grounded for so long and only for being a couple of hours late.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So he said, you have to be kidding.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You have got to be kidding.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So this is a rhetorical.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So he's not talking about joking here.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He's saying, no way.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I can't believe it.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is not happening to me.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, you're not serious.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're not serious.

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So he's upset and I would be too.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No one likes to be grounded, but he's saying, OK, come on.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No way.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's too serious.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's right.

186
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So this is what this is a phrase that you can use with someone if you're not really believing what they're saying or you're surprised.

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You have to be kidding me.

188
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah, but usually there's also a degree of anger.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So you're upset at the decision.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
For example, I'm watching the World Cup right now and there was a foul and I was very upset because I didn't think it was a foul and I said, you have got to be kidding me.

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, so that's exactly the way that we would use that phrase.

193
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And well, obviously, the mother had made up her mind.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
She's very decided and she said, I don't want to hear it.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So this is the end of the conversation, OK?

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
This is one of those phrases that will just stop anything you're talking about.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So they're arguing and she says, nope, I don't want to hear it.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That means no more excuses, no more talking.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is the end.

200
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

201
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't want to hear it.

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And it's used in many scenarios, right?

203
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Not only for somebody being angry or grounded, but also in a meeting.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't want to hear it.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's it.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We're doing my idea.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We're going forward with it.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Well, be careful, because that's usually what the boss will say.

209
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's not it's not the most gentle phrase.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And so you have to be careful with how you use it.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But if you have authority, like you're a parent or you're a boss, you can say, nope, I don't want to hear it.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I have made my decision.

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
OK, so we've taken a look at a lot of great things.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue one last time, and we'll be back in a bit.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
All right, we're back.

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So obviously, we've all been grounded.

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What is the longest you've been grounded for?

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you remember?

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I was a good girl, so maybe a week.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Really?

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, maybe not even.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I never really got in trouble as a kid.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What about you?

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think I think once I was grounded the entire summer.

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh, Ross.

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, the entire summer vacation.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't remember exactly what I did, but my dad was pretty upset with me.

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And yeah, he was really strict.

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So I got grounded quite a bit.

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I tend to think that girls get in trouble less.

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't know if it's because they're good.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I think probably it's because they're better at hiding things from their parents.

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, maybe.

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Because whenever I would come home, my mother would always wake up, but she doesn't really understand what time it is.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And so I'd say, oh, Mom, it's 11 o'clock.

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Good night.

239
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And it'd be like 4 o'clock in the morning, and she had no idea.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So who was the person or the parent that put their foot down?

241
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Was it your mom or your dad?

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
My dad was the serious one.

243
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, really?

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, it's interesting because sometimes it's the dad that's very strict, and the mom kind of helps you out and tries to kind of not get you grounded or something.

245
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But sometimes it's the other way around.

246
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The mom is really strict and firm, and the dad's like, come on, don't ground him.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They're just having fun.

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well, I think in some families, the children understand who is strict and who is maybe not so strict.

249
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And so they say, oh, well, Mom said that it's OK.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
So I think maybe you should let me go out, and the dad will be very angry because the mother said that it's OK.

251
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's right.

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
All right, so that's all the time we have for today.

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We're really curious to get your stories.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Maybe tell us why were you grounded or how long were you grounded for?

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Or what was your curfew when you were a child or growing up?

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

257
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We hope to see you there.

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

259
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Bye.
