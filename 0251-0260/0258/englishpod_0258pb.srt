00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,679
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:05,440
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,500
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,480
And today we have a lesson for you all about life at home and life with your parents.

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:13,480
That's right.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,940
We've all lived with our parents when we were younger, or maybe we still do.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,039
And of course, they have certain rules in the house.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,660
And well, when you break those rules, something happens.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,879
There are consequences, and that's what's happening in today's dialogue.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,800
So let's take a listen to this dialogue.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,679
And when we come back, we'll be talking more about what's going on and what some of these words and phrases mean.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,119
Do you know what time it is?

13
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,899
Um, 10?

14
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,880
Get in this door, young man.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,859
It's midnight.

16
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,119
You are two hours past curfew.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,159
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,259
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.

19
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:01,340
I don't care.

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,759
You are grounded for life, mister.

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,180
Mom, that is so unfair.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,000
You know the rules, and you broke them.

23
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,760
No allowance and no TV for a week.

24
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,459
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,219
What?

26
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,400
For being a couple of hours late?

27
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,099
You have to be kidding.

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,739
I don't want to hear it.

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:23,859
Now go to your room.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,579
Alright, we're back.

31
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:36,540
So a very typical case, somebody or the kid returns home, it's too late, and now they're in trouble.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,159
Yes, his parents are not very happy.

33
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,840
In this case, it's his mom who is telling him what the consequences will be.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,000
So let's take a look at language takeaway and find out what some of these keywords are.

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,219
Language takeaway.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,480
Alright, so the first word that we're going to take a look at is actually something that his mom said, and he said that you are two hours past curfew.

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,500
Curfew.

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,040
So curfew has to do specifically with the time when your parents expect you at home.

39
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:06,980
That's right.

40
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,639
So if your curfew is 10 o'clock, you have to be home before or by 10 o'clock.

41
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:13,080
Right.

42
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:20,979
So in this case, if the boy's curfew is 10 o'clock and he arrives home at midnight, 12 o'clock, he's two hours past curfew.

43
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:21,800
That's right.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,439
And even sometimes cities or governments will implement certain curfews at certain times.

45
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,159
That's right.

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,199
And I don't think adults really have curfews at home.

47
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:31,800
No, I don't think so.

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,840
It depends on what you want, but kids definitely have curfews.

49
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,879
What happens, though, Marco, when you break curfew?

50
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:50,460
So this is a very serious offense, and you're going to get punished, and the way that we say this, usually parents to their children, you are grounded, or you ground that kid.

51
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,560
OK, so you might have heard this word when talking about airplanes or flights at an airport.

52
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,900
The plane was grounded.

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,379
It basically means it can't go anywhere.

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,439
And so when you're talking about a kid or a person, you basically mean, OK, you're grounded.

55
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,439
You can't go out with your friends.

56
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,419
You can't go anywhere.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,860
Usually you can go to school, but you can't have fun is the meaning.

58
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,520
That's right.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,520
So it's usually a fixed phrase.

60
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,460
You're grounded.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,979
That means that you are punished.

62
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:17,939
You can't go out.

63
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:21,599
But in this case, the mom specified saying you're grounded.

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,900
So that means that he can't go out.

65
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,280
But on top of that, she said no allowance and no TV for a week.

66
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:29,479
Oh, man.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,340
So allowance is the money that your parents give you to go out, like to go to the movies or something.

68
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:39,939
And your parents might give this to you on a weekly basis.

69
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,419
So every Saturday you get five dollars or on a monthly basis.

70
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,300
Every month you get twenty dollars.

71
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,419
And when his mother says you're not going to have any allowance for a week, that means we're not going to give you any money this week.

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,240
That's right.

73
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:55,060
So that is an allowance.

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,479
How much money you get per month or per week.

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,699
The key thing about allowance, though, is that it's not something you do for work.

76
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,460
You don't work and receive allowance.

77
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
If you work, you have a salary.

78
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,099
Allowance is something that you get for free from someone.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,379
So you can get an allowance from your boss to eat, but you can also have an allowance for your parents to do fun things.

80
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:14,819
That's right.

81
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:21,680
So usually kids, obviously, they can't work, so they get an allowance from their parents, usually for fun things like going to the movies and stuff.

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,139
Exactly.

83
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:22,779
All right.

84
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:30,680
Now, going back a little bit, let's take a look at two ways that the mom addressed or called her son, because obviously it's her son.

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,879
But when he got home, she said, get in this door, young man.

86
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,199
OK, these are angry mom phrases.

87
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,319
Yeah.

88
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,759
When you're when you're in trouble, your parents tend to use different words to talk to you.

89
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,920
So this is a very popular one.

90
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,579
Young man.

91
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,160
Right.

92
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,540
So it's like saying you should be mature, but you made a mistake.

93
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:51,040
Yeah.

94
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:51,959
All right.

95
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,459
So come inside right now, young man.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,920
Yeah.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,319
It's a it's a it's a way to kind of emphasize that you are also very angry.

98
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,519
And also, when he was trying to explain what happened, she said, I don't care.

99
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:07,000
You're grounded for life, mister.

100
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,180
You're grounded for life, mister.

101
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,379
So these are both ways of talking to young boys.

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,220
Mister is the opposite of Miss.

103
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,860
But in the case of a young girl, you'd say, get in this door, young lady.

104
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,339
Right.

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,100
And then you're grounded for life, Missy.

106
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:23,879
Missy.

107
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,259
Yeah, I think they say Missy.

108
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:25,720
Missy.

109
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:26,819
So Missy, Mr.

110
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:28,040
Young man, young lady.

111
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,480
These are all ways of referring to people in kind of it's weird.

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,259
It's kind of like they're adults, but they're not.

113
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:35,079
Yeah, that's right.

114
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,259
That's like saying you're in trouble.

115
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,620
So very interesting things going on here with this young man who got grounded.

116
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,740
Why don't we go back?

117
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Let's take a look at our dialog again and we'll be back in a bit.

118
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,399
Do you know what time it is?

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,079
Um, 10.

120
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,040
Get in this door, young man.

121
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:06,000
It's midnight.

122
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,279
You are two hours past curfew.

123
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,300
I know, but it wasn't my fault.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,399
I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10, but she wouldn't leave the party.

125
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:15,480
I don't care.

126
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,879
You are grounded for life, mister.

127
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,360
Mom, that is so unfair.

128
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,160
You know the rules and you broke them.

129
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,920
No allowance and no TV for a week.

130
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,600
I usually never ground you, but this time I have to put my foot down.

131
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,360
What?

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,540
For being a couple of hours late?

133
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:35,259
You have to be kidding.

134
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:36,899
I don't want to hear it.

135
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,199
Now go to your room.

136
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:42,860
All right, we're back.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,120
So now let's take a look at four key phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

138
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:48,959
Fluency Builder.

139
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,540
All right, so this first phrase is something that actually we hear when the young boy or the young man is giving his excuse for being late.

140
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,439
He said, listen, I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before 10.

141
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,240
That's right.

142
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:06,079
So the phrasal verb there is to drop off.

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,040
This means to leave someone somewhere.

144
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:10,759
That's right.

145
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,699
But usually it means to drive someone to a certain place.

146
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,800
So for example, Jennifer probably has a car and Jennifer was supposed to take this boy home.

147
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,480
So he said she was going to drop me off before 10 o'clock.

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,560
That means kind of leave her, leave him at his house.

149
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,199
That's right.

150
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,120
So the verb is to drop off, but we usually insert the subject in between it.

151
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,139
So to drop me off.

152
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,920
She is going to drop me off.

153
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,779
I dropped him off at the bank.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,560
That's right.

155
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,680
All right, so now that Jennifer was supposed to drop him off at 10, that didn't happen.

156
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,220
So he got grounded and his mom was saying that she usually doesn't really ground him, but this time I have to put my foot down.

157
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,259
She's angry.

158
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:49,939
Yeah.

159
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,600
He's upset and she's angry and she said, listen, I have to put my foot down.

160
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,279
What does this mean?

161
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,100
You put your foot on the ground?

162
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,839
It's strange to hear this phrase.

163
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,639
It means that she's going to be strict, that she's not going to let him just get away with it or not ground him.

164
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,920
She really has to be strict and she has to punish him.

165
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,160
Okay, so to put your foot down or I put my foot down.

166
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,480
This means to be strict with someone, to not maybe bend the rules or be flexible.

167
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,860
So for example, my mother was always very, very loose with my brother.

168
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:24,100
He could do what he wanted or whatever, but one day he did something really horrible and she finally put her foot down and she grounded him.

169
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,639
She grounded him for three months.

170
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,139
All right, so that's what happens when somebody puts their foot down.

171
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,460
And now obviously he was very surprised that he's going to be grounded for so long and only for being a couple of hours late.

172
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,899
So he said, you have to be kidding.

173
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,720
You have got to be kidding.

174
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,940
So this is a rhetorical.

175
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:45,419
So he's not talking about joking here.

176
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,299
He's saying, no way.

177
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,899
I can't believe it.

178
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,600
This is not happening to me.

179
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,700
Yeah, you're not serious.

180
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:52,700
You're not serious.

181
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,840
So he's upset and I would be too.

182
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,299
No one likes to be grounded, but he's saying, OK, come on.

183
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:58,940
No way.

184
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,860
That's too serious.

185
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,559
That's right.

186
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:07,460
So this is what this is a phrase that you can use with someone if you're not really believing what they're saying or you're surprised.

187
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,779
You have to be kidding me.

188
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,440
Yeah, but usually there's also a degree of anger.

189
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,419
So you're upset at the decision.

190
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:22,919
For example, I'm watching the World Cup right now and there was a foul and I was very upset because I didn't think it was a foul and I said, you have got to be kidding me.

191
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,620
That's right.

192
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,399
OK, so that's exactly the way that we would use that phrase.

193
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,379
And well, obviously, the mother had made up her mind.

194
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,480
She's very decided and she said, I don't want to hear it.

195
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,340
So this is the end of the conversation, OK?

196
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,379
This is one of those phrases that will just stop anything you're talking about.

197
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,659
So they're arguing and she says, nope, I don't want to hear it.

198
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:46,639
That means no more excuses, no more talking.

199
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,559
This is the end.

200
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,220
That's right.

201
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,139
I don't want to hear it.

202
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,840
And it's used in many scenarios, right?

203
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,559
Not only for somebody being angry or grounded, but also in a meeting.

204
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,320
I don't want to hear it.

205
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:55,679
That's it.

206
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,080
We're doing my idea.

207
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,220
We're going forward with it.

208
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,559
Well, be careful, because that's usually what the boss will say.

209
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,340
That's right.

210
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,039
It's not it's not the most gentle phrase.

211
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,960
And so you have to be careful with how you use it.

212
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,440
But if you have authority, like you're a parent or you're a boss, you can say, nope, I don't want to hear it.

213
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,159
I have made my decision.

214
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,860
That's right.

215
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,879
OK, so we've taken a look at a lot of great things.

216
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,200
Why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue one last time, and we'll be back in a bit.

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,519
All right, we're back.

218
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,220
So obviously, we've all been grounded.

219
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,039
What is the longest you've been grounded for?

220
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,559
Do you remember?

221
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:24,220
I was a good girl, so maybe a week.

222
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:24,919
Really?

223
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,799
Yeah, maybe not even.

224
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,460
I never really got in trouble as a kid.

225
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:28,960
What about you?

226
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:31,980
I think I think once I was grounded the entire summer.

227
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,100
Oh, Ross.

228
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,960
Yeah, the entire summer vacation.

229
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,159
I don't remember exactly what I did, but my dad was pretty upset with me.

230
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,860
And yeah, he was really strict.

231
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,500
So I got grounded quite a bit.

232
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,860
I tend to think that girls get in trouble less.

233
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,860
I don't know if it's because they're good.

234
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,980
I think probably it's because they're better at hiding things from their parents.

235
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,639
Yeah, maybe.

236
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,480
Because whenever I would come home, my mother would always wake up, but she doesn't really understand what time it is.

237
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,139
And so I'd say, oh, Mom, it's 11 o'clock.

238
00:11:59,139 --> 00:11:59,720
Good night.

239
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:02,980
And it'd be like 4 o'clock in the morning, and she had no idea.

240
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,639
So who was the person or the parent that put their foot down?

241
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:08,659
Was it your mom or your dad?

242
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,139
My dad was the serious one.

243
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,620
Oh, really?

244
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:19,860
Yeah, it's interesting because sometimes it's the dad that's very strict, and the mom kind of helps you out and tries to kind of not get you grounded or something.

245
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:21,379
But sometimes it's the other way around.

246
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,580
The mom is really strict and firm, and the dad's like, come on, don't ground him.

247
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,179
They're just having fun.

248
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,919
Well, I think in some families, the children understand who is strict and who is maybe not so strict.

249
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,580
And so they say, oh, well, Mom said that it's OK.

250
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:40,259
So I think maybe you should let me go out, and the dad will be very angry because the mother said that it's OK.

251
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:40,940
That's right.

252
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,340
All right, so that's all the time we have for today.

253
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,759
We're really curious to get your stories.

254
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,539
Maybe tell us why were you grounded or how long were you grounded for?

255
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,340
Or what was your curfew when you were a child or growing up?

256
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,159
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

257
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,019
We hope to see you there.

258
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,000
All right, we'll see you guys there.

259
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,220
Bye.
