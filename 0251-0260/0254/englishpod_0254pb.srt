00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod, my name is Marco.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine and today we've got an elementary level lesson for you all about getting up in the morning.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right, today we're making breakfast and well of course many people have different things when they're making breakfast, some of them are very big, others are small, so but this is what we're gonna talk about today so why don't we listen to the dialogue and see what they're having for breakfast today.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Smells good, what's for breakfast?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well since we're getting up so late I decided to make a big breakfast.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Nice, brunch!

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Kind of, so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some french toast and buttermilk pancakes.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Wow, you really went all out, did you make any coffee?

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, just the way you like it.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Looks good, I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Get the jam and butter while you are in there, oh and don't forget the syrup.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Alrighty.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Alright we're back so a lot of interesting things, a huge breakfast.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Way too big for me, I don't like to eat a big breakfast because I feel like it makes me tired and then I don't have any energy.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Especially if you just get up right?

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Exactly, you need to shower and maybe have some fruit and then go to work but we can talk about that at the end.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There were a lot of interesting words and phrases that we heard that we would benefit from taking a closer look at.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Alright so on Language Takeaway today we're going to take a look at our first word and it's an interesting word, it's kind of a mix of two things, brunch.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right, so this word comes from two different words, breakfast, breakfast and lunch.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right, so brunch.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So if you have brunch what is exactly brunch?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well there's two ways to look at brunch, one is the time element, usually brunch is later than breakfast but maybe a little earlier than lunch so eleven o'clock or maybe even noon.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But the other thing is size, because you're putting two meals together usually brunch is very big, you eat a lot of food.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay so it's a perfect combination of breakfast and lunch.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm the type of person that likes having scrambled eggs at noon so this is a perfect solution, brunch.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Right, you don't have to only eat eggs at breakfast, you can eat them at lunch as well.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Exactly.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is actually something we do a lot in America for Mother's Day.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So mom wakes up late, we take her to brunch, it's a very big special meal.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Very good, and talking about eggs and the types of eggs that we can have, I mentioned scrambled eggs and in the dialogue we also heard soft boiled eggs.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, these are two very important kinds of eggs, usually if you're in a restaurant they will ask you how do you want your eggs cooked or done and my answer is always scrambled.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This means someone mixes the eggs before they are cooked and then when they cook they are hard, they're yellow, there's no white, it's just yellow and it's a little hard mixture.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But soft boiled eggs are very very different.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right, soft boiled eggs you actually don't break the egg or open the egg to cook it like in scrambled eggs, you actually put the entire egg in boiling water, I think it's for two minutes and then you take it out and then you open the shell and the eggs are kind of cooked, it's kind of hard in some parts but it's also kind of liquidy in other parts.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right, so the outside, the white part is hard but the yellow part, the yolk, is liquid, it's not hard.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right, and actually if you want the whole egg to be hard, you can ask for hard boiled eggs.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right, those are cooked for much longer.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right, okay, so we have scrambled eggs, soft boiled eggs, we have french toast and we have buttermilk pancakes.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, so you can ask for just pancakes but if you want to be specific, you want to give instructions about what kind of pancakes, you can ask for buttermilk pancakes.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And what exactly is buttermilk?

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Buttermilk is a very, very creamy eggy milk that's very, very high in fat, that makes everything taste better, I think.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is used a lot in baking, not really in other kinds of foods, so you can have buttermilk muffins or buttermilk biscuits, but usually you have buttermilk pancakes and so these are very rich, very fatty pancakes.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Awesome, yeah, they taste delicious.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright, so now if we want to eat a little bit more healthy, we do have some cereal and some muesli.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Muesli is a funny word, it's not a sound we make very often in English, muesli.

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think it actually comes from German.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It does look German, because actually the spelling is M-U-E, so you would kind of want to say muesli, muesli or something.

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, no, we say muesli and it's basically a mixture of granola or different kinds of fiber grains.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, so just think of having like raisins and maybe some almonds, granola, all mixed up and you have this nice thing that goes well with yogurt, muesli.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's very, very tasty and also very good for you.

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, and now well actually going back to pancakes, no pancake is possible to eat unless you put syrup on it, right?

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, some people might disagree.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I know a lot of people who eat pancakes with honey or butter, but the best I think is with syrup and syrup is basically liquid sugar and you put it on your pancakes to make them sweeter.

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Okay, actually it's the same thing as honey basically, except that it doesn't come from bees.

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Right, so real syrup, we say maple syrup, comes from maple trees and you tap the tree and it comes out and it's very, very, very sweet.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But we also have syrup you can buy at the store which is man-made.

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's basically just sugar.

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, very good, so that's what we have with pancakes usually, but why don't we go back, listen to our dialogue again, let's review all of these yummy breakfast treats and we'll come back in a bit with Fluency Builder.

60
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Smells good, what's for breakfast?

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Nice, brunch.

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Kind of, so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some French toast and buttermilk pancakes.

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Wow, you really went all out.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Did you make any coffee?

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, just the way you like it.

67
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Looks good, I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

69
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Get the jam and butter while you are in there.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh, and don't forget the syrup.

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Alrighty.

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Alright, so now on Fluency Builder, why don't we take a look at a couple of phrases.

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Fluency Builder.

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
When the guy was kind of surprised, he said, wow, you really went all out.

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, so this comes from the phrase to go all out.

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So he went all out, or I'm going to go all out.

77
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And this means to give something your best, to do more than is expected.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's right, so if you go all out when you're making breakfast, it means you cooked a lot or really good and you spend a lot of time doing it.

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Or for example, if it's someone's birthday and I know it's their birthday, I go all out by buying gifts and a cake and lots of decorations and calling all of their friends and having a party.

80
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So this is doing everything for them.

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's right, okay.

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And he was really surprised and he really seemed to enjoy breakfast and he said, looks good.

83
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Okay, this is a way to say good job or nicely done.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's almost a way to say I'm happy about this.

85
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, and obviously you can also say that the food looks delicious, so it looks good.

86
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It looks good, so it's a way to say, you know, well done, looks good.

87
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Or in this case, looks very tasty.

88
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's right, okay.

89
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And now this is an interesting part.

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He says I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

91
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So let's take a look at this verb, squeeze.

92
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,000
To squeeze.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This is something you usually do with your hand when you tighten something.

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So for example, your toothpaste.

95
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes, you squeeze your toothpaste so the toothpaste will come out.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So in this case we are squeezing the orange juice to extract the juice.

97
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's right, so you hold the orange very tight, you make the juice come out, and then you have fresh squeezed orange juice.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And this is different from orange juice you buy in a store.

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, so you can say I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That means you're going to make fresh orange juice.

101
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And this fresh orange juice that you make is called fresh squeezed orange juice.

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Fresh squeezed.

103
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You've probably seen this in the store.

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like some bottles they say 100% fresh squeezed orange juice or something.

105
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, it's good for advertising.

106
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
All right, so very good.

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
A lot of great interesting phrases there.

108
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why don't we listen to our dialogue one last time.

109
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Smells good.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What's for breakfast?

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

112
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Nice.

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Brunch.

114
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Kind of.

115
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some French toast, and buttermilk pancakes.

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wow, you really went all out.

117
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Did you make any coffee?

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yeah, just the way you like it.

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something to eat.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Looks good.

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
All right, so talking about brunch and breakfast, what is your typical or ideal breakfast?

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's a hard question.

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.

125
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So I could eat breakfast, all kinds of breakfast, any time.

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But one of my favorite kinds of breakfast is a Greek diner breakfast.

127
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Greek diner.

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What does this have?

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay, well, we have a lot of diners or small restaurants that are very, very cheap and fast in America.

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And this usually involves some scrambled eggs that are made with cheese.

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Okay.

132
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And toast and potatoes and bacon and sausage and a coffee.

133
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wow.

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Big breakfast.

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Very big.

136
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But delicious.

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Nice.

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What's your favorite?

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I also really, really like breakfast.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And I actually like having places that you can have 24 hour a day breakfast.

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
All day breakfast it's called.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I can have breakfast for dinner.

143
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Right.

144
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's usually in America you go to a diner because they have breakfast at four o'clock in the morning or at seven o'clock at night.

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not really a coffee person.

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I actually enjoy either juice, orange juice or hot chocolate.

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I really like hot chocolate.

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And definitely pancakes.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Three buttermilk pancakes stacked.

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And as you said before, syrup.

151
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But I actually also put butter on it.

152
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Gross.

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I know a lot of people who do that.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
They put butter on first.

155
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yeah.

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And then they pour the syrup.

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, of course.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So it's like complete, very, very fatty.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And hash browns.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm definitely fat enough hash browns.

161
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Those are potatoes that are chopped very, very finely and you fry them together.

162
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So it almost becomes like a potato pancake.

163
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, exactly.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So a lot of great stuff.

165
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And obviously breakfasts around the world are different.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I know, for example, in some countries they have the fisherman's breakfast.

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So in the morning you have black coffee, rice and fish.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because you're going to work all day.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So we're really curious about how breakfast is in your country.

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What a typical breakfast is like.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, what are traditional breakfasts and what is your favorite breakfast?

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
We hope to see you there.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All right, bye.

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Bye.

177
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thank you.
