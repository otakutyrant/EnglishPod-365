EnglishPod.com Smells good!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's for breakfast?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Nice!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Brunch!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Kind of.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some French toast, and buttermilk pancakes.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Wow, you really went all out.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Did you make any coffee?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yeah, just the way you like it.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Looks good!

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Get the jam and butter while you are in there.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, and don't forget the syrup.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alrighty!
