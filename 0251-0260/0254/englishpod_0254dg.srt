EnglishPod.com Smells good!

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,619
What's for breakfast?

3
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:12,880
Well, since we're getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast.

4
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:13,900
Nice!

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,720
Brunch!

6
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:15,820
Kind of.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,899
So I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some French toast, and buttermilk pancakes.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,079
Wow, you really went all out.

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,219
Did you make any coffee?

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,199
Yeah, just the way you like it.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,460
I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,640
Looks good!

13
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,579
I'll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,000
Get the jam and butter while you are in there.

15
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,679
Oh, and don't forget the syrup.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,140
Alrighty!
