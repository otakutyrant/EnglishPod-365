00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, English learners, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hi, everyone.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have another episode of our interview series lessons.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we're taking a look at a very important aspect of an interview.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're talking about salary and money.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So this is the end of the interview, and we're starting to talk about details of the job.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's check this out, listen to the dialogue one time, and when we come back we'll be talking more about what's going on.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, Ms.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I'd like to clarify.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, feel free to ask me anything, and I'll try to fill in the details.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Could I first ask about the renumeration package?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, of course.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's quite an important point, isn't it?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As a junior sub-editor, we offer a starting salary of 150,000 Hong Kong dollars per annum.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I understand.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And are there other bonuses included?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, apart from full health insurance, we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers, but we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, Mr.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The opportunity to work in Hong Kong with your company is the most important thing for me.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Excellent.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right, we're back, so let's take a look at a couple of words and phrases on language takeaway.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Language takeaway.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, so this first phrase is a set phrase.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That means these words often go together.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The phrase is remuneration package.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right, a remuneration package.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Rebecca said, could I first ask about the remuneration package?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So what's an easier way to say this, Marco?

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I guess basically the salary.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But a package means that it's not just money, it's also some of the benefits or the bonuses.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So this is a way to describe how a person is paid in general.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So the remuneration package that Rebecca is being offered, Mr.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Parsons said that she would get a starting salary of $150,000 per annum.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Okay, so this phrase, starting salary, is another fixed phrase.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We have a lot of these today.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That means these two words go together, starting salary.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So salary is easy.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's the amount of money you make either per month or per week or per year.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But what is a starting salary?

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How is that different?

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well, basically that's the money that you would start earning in the company, but obviously with time it could change and you can get more money.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So this means that you will start making this much money, but it's possible that in the future you will make more.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This is the starting salary.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And well, of course, as we said, it's $150,000 Hong Kong dollars per annum.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So now we're specifying how often you're getting this money per annum.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So if it were per month, this might be a lot of money.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But this is how much money she will earn per year, per annum.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This comes from Latin.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So per year.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So this is the remuneration package.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Not only is she getting $150,000 per annum, she's also getting a housing allowance.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, so many of us had allowances when we were children.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This means the money that your parents gave you each week, $5 or $10, while a housing allowance is a little bit different.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It means the money that your company gives you per month or per year to pay for your apartment or your house.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's right.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So obviously the company is saying that, look, we're going to give you a certain amount of money for you to pay for your house.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't have to really pay for your house.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We'll pay for it.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
So basically it's a benefit.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a part of this remuneration package.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You get a salary and you get money for your house.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a pretty nice deal.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And well also she's getting health insurance and she is also being offered a company staff bonus scheme.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, bonus scheme.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A bonus is something extra.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's on top of what you normally get, but a bonus scheme indicates that the bonus changes according to how well you do.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's right.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So obviously he's specifying that the bonus scheme is linked to readership numbers.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So let's say, for example, Marco sells newspapers.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Marco, you sell on a good week 100 newspapers.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you sell 150, you get a bonus of $10, but if you sell 200 newspapers, you get a bonus of $50.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is a scheme.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The numbers change.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Very good.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So all of this that we've just talked about, to be clear, is our remuneration package.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We're talking about a salary.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We're talking about housing allowance, health insurance, and even a bonus scheme.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So a package can include these things and much, much more.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
CEOs get bigger remuneration packages.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
They do.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And if you have children, sometimes a part of your package is education costs for your children or a car or computers, things like that.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's right.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So a lot of great stuff there talking about salaries and a little bit of negotiating it.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay, well, I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, Ms.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I'd like to clarify.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, feel free to ask me anything, and I'll try to fill in the details.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Could I first ask about the remuneration package?

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes, of course.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's quite an important point, isn't it?

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
As a junior sub-editor, we offer a starting salary of 150,000 Hong Kong dollars per annum.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I understand.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And are there other bonuses included?

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, apart from full health insurance, we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, Mr.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The opportunity to work in Hong Kong with your company is the most important thing for me.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Excellent.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
All right, so now let's take a look at Fluency Builder.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Fluency Builder.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So at the beginning of the dialogue, Rebecca is talking to Mr.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Parsons about the job, and she says, you know, I don't really have that many questions, but when I talked to Ms.

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Childs about the job over the phone, there were some things she wanted to clarify.

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So how did she talk to her?

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She talked to her over the phone.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So this is a really good phrase to specify that you received information or you did business talking on the phone, not in person.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, so this is a bit strange because we use the preposition over.

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You could also say I'm on the phone.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That means I'm talking on the phone.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But over the phone means by phone.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right.

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Not by mail or email or in person, but we communicate, we talk over the phone, by phone.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So sometimes, for example, people will see a TV commercial with a nice item or device that they want to buy, and they will purchase this object, maybe a DVD player, over the phone.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
They will call up this number and order it.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Or you can say, you know, I'm really sorry, Marco, but I don't feel comfortable talking about my banking details over the phone.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's right.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay, so that means on the phone.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So then Mr.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Parsons said, feel free to ask me anything, okay?

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Feel free to ask me anything about the job.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay, this is a phrase that I use all the time, and I think it's really important when you're in a business context or a work context to say, listen, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It means don't hesitate.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't be nervous.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you have a question, just ask it.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's right.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
So feel free to ask.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't worry about it.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Just ask me.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's a very good phrase to give someone or to make someone feel more comfortable around you.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Exactly, exactly.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
All right, and he said that I'll try to fill in the details.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay, so this is an interesting phrase because fill in, you know, on a form, for example, means put your name in a box or fill in some numbers.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But here, the details, we think maybe I don't know what the details are.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So to fill them in means to fill in gaps or some blanks.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So like, I don't know all the details.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Please tell me the information so that I will know them.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So what he's basically saying is, I know that you have an idea or a general overview of how things are, but if you ask me, I can tell you more specific things.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's fill in the details.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Or for example, we're going to a party on Saturday night, but I don't know where the party is yet.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How about on Friday, I call you to fill you in on the details.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Very good.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, so those are the phrases that we've prepared for you today.

166
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think we've taken a look at a lot of great vocab.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why don't we listen to the dialogue one last time and we'll be back to talk to you a little bit more.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, well I'm sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, well Ms.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I'd like to clarify.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, feel free to ask me anything and I'll try to fill in the details.

172
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Could I first ask about the renumeration package?

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, of course.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's quite an important point, isn't it?

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
As a junior sub-editor, we offer a starting salary of 150,000 Hong Kong dollars per annum.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This doesn't include a generous housing allowance also.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I understand.

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And are there other bonuses included?

179
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, apart from full health insurance, we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, Mr.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The opportunity to work in Hong Kong with your company is the most important thing for me.

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Excellent.

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, what other questions do you have, Rebecca?

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right, so talking about salaries and remuneration packages, now is this a common word to talk about remuneration?

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes, it is.

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It basically means the way that you are paid for the work that you do.

189
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So remuneration, it sounds like a big long word.

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But in America, I think we also just talk about salary or compensation.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Compensation packages.

192
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, so now when we talk about remuneration, we don't necessarily always talk about money like in this case, right?

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We can receive other benefits.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's right.

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And so a lot of times people think of the important parts of remuneration not just to be the salary, but also to be the benefits.

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And so benefits are not the money, they're the other stuff.

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They're healthcare.

198
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We said earlier, a housing allowance, even bonuses and things like that or education for your children.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
These are extras and these are a part of the package.

200
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Now what would you prefer to have a good remuneration package like these other additional benefits with a low salary?

201
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Or would you prefer to have a high salary with not many of these benefits?

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, I think that it's nice to get the benefits and a lower salary because oftentimes at a company like a big company, the company can get really good rates on healthcare.

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
So if I have to pay for my healthcare with my big salary, maybe it will cost me more money.

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But if my company pays with the company rate, that means the amount that they pay, then maybe they can help me pay for these things much cheaper.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And so in the end, I make more money.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Actually, I've heard in some companies that offer great remuneration packages, like if you have children, as you said, they would pay for their education.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But many times they would even pay for their childcare, like maybe a nanny.

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Some of them, some of the managers would receive maybe a fuel bonus.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So they would get, I don't know, $200 extra a month for fuel for their car if they drive to work.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So I think companies can get a little bit creative and it's not that much that they're actually spending, but you take it as to being a really good benefit.

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, that's right.

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And it makes you more, I think, happy to work for that company because you feel like they're taking care of you, not just they're giving you money, they're actually taking care of you and your family.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's right.

214
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So we're actually a little bit curious to know how remuneration packages work in your company or maybe in your country.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So please let us know.

217
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You obviously don't have to tell us how much money you earn, but if you want to tell us how these things work, where you come from, our website is EnglishPod.com.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We'll see you there.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
All right.

220
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Bye.

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Bye.

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Bye.
