00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we've got a very advanced dialogue for you.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is all about what we call the miracle of life.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's right.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we're going to talk a little bit more in-depth about our bodies, about what's going on inside, and how and where babies come from.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So you're going to learn very technical terms for parts of people's bodies, men and women, and also about the beginning of life.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So before a baby is born, what do you call some of these parts and some of these things?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's check out today's dialogue, and when we come back, we'll be exploring in-depth these topics.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I'm sure that some of the things we will be talking about today may surprise you.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Billy, can you turn on the projector please?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thanks.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Okay, does anyone know what this is?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Looks like a goat head to me.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Nice try, but this is a woman's womb, which contains her uterus and ovaries.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The ovaries are packed with eggs, and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is called ovulation, and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of a woman's cycle.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
In an average 28-day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day one as the first day of your last period.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's amazing!

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Actually, every woman is already born with over 400,000 eggs.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Some will start dying off immediately, and others are released during her fertile period.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What about the guys?

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know they produce sperm and stuff.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm 24 hours a day.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Each ejaculation will release about 100 million sperm, so the factory is always pretty busy.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So then we basically need to put one and one together so we can have babies, right?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now this is where the race begins, and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 12 hours.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Not all of them make it, since some of them go the wrong way and get lost or simply die.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Many will actually reach the egg, but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then that's it?

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells known as the embryo travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Any other questions?

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then let's move on.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Alright, we're back, so very interesting.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Actually this type of lecture or class that we just saw is very common in biology class or anatomy class in the US, for example.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right, we also have a class called Sex-Ed or Sexual Education, and this is all about sex and bodies and biology that most students have to learn before they go into high school.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right, so we actually had a previous lesson about Sex-Ed, we talked about contraceptives, and well, continuing on the topic, this is why we have this advanced lesson.

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, it is a little bit more difficult because we have medical terms and specific names of parts inside of our body, so why don't we start with the first one when the teacher explained about a woman's womb.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Womb, so this might look like a very hard word to pronounce, there's a B there, so W-O-M-B, we don't pronounce womb, we say womb.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This is basically where the baby will grow when a baby is produced, so it's a part inside a woman's body that we also call the uterus.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay, so I guess the uterus is the specific name of that area, right?

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But I guess the whole thing, kind of like the woman's belly, where the baby is going to be, is called the womb.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay, so now, taking a look at other parts of a woman's body, we have the womb, we have the uterus, now what about the ovaries?

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So ovaries are, actually there are two of them in a woman's body, and ovaries are where eggs are stored, so women have eggs, and this is what will one day become, in some cases, a baby, and so they are stored in ovaries, and when it's time to come down, they come down through the uterus, through these tubes, to either come out or to be met by a sperm.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Right, and these tubes are actually called fallopian tubes.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So a hard word, fallopian, again, there are two of these, right?

59
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
One from each ovary, and they come down, and that's basically a passageway for eggs.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right, and it's interesting because in English, some women that don't want to have any more kids, they very colloquially say, I have my tubes tied, or I had my tubes tied.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's right, so this means a woman has had an operation so that she will not have children in the future, and her fallopian tubes are closed off so that eggs cannot come down.

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's right, so this is kind of, now you more or less, if you've heard this phrase before, now you understand why, the fallopian tubes, and that's why women say tubes tied.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, she had her tubes tied.

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright, so now all of this is going on because, well, a woman can potentially get pregnant, and during this period of time, this is when the woman is ovulating, or this is called ovulation.

65
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's right, so ovulation is a cycle, that means it's something that happens again and again and again, we call it a menstrual cycle, and it happens once, basically it's a process that takes 28 days, and it's the process of an egg coming down, and either being fertilized or not.

66
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's right, so during ovulation, there is a certain period of time where it's precise for a woman to be able to get pregnant, right?

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And now, what about when we move on to the men?

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now we talked about the women's side, what about the men's?

69
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So basically, women have eggs, men have sperm.

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, these are little, they look like fish almost, they swim around, and they are passed to a woman through semen, and men have, I don't know, like 10 million of them or something crazy.

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yeah, it's a huge amount of sperm.

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now this is an interesting thing to differentiate, you said two things, sperm and semen, right?

73
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So sperm are the little creatures or little fish, as you said, that swim, and semen is kind of actually like the liquid that contains them.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's right, so it's almost, not bigger than, but it's the liquid that they come in to basically attack an egg and try and fertilize an egg, and so remember, in English, sperm can fertilize an egg, semen cannot.

75
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Right, and now this is interesting, we're talking about to fertilize, maybe we've heard this in gardening or something like this, we've heard of fertilizer, but what do we mean by to fertilize or fertilization?

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay basically, fertilization or to fertilize something is to, in this case, put a sperm together with an egg, so to make a baby.

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's right.

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And so an egg that is not fertilized will come down and will never become a baby.

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Sometimes sperm, they don't find eggs and they just, you know, they die.

80
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Now there's another interesting word that's very related or close to this, when we say when a man or a woman is fertile.

81
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right, so this only applies to women, not to men.

82
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can say she's fertile, that means she has eggs, her eggs come down, and she can have a baby at some time.

83
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But a woman who is infertile, she's not fertile, can never have babies.

84
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's right.

85
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So a lot of these women adopt babies.

86
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now what about guys?

87
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You know that some men can't have babies as well.

88
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Maybe their sperm is not very good, or they have some same thing, medical condition that prevents their sperm from fertilizing, so you don't say that he is infertile or not fertile.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No you don't.

90
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What do you say?

91
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He is sterile, okay?

92
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So a woman can be fertile or infertile.

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Infertile means she cannot have babies.

94
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If a man's semen cannot fertilize an egg properly, he is called sterile.

95
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay, very good.

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So this is all of what's going on inside the man's body as well.

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And well actually once they finally combine and get together and the sperm fertilize the egg, we have a little thing called an embryo.

98
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay so obviously it doesn't become a baby for a little while.

99
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is a point of contention, a point of argument for a lot of people because no one agrees when a baby becomes a baby.

100
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But basically when an egg and a sperm come together, they create an embryo, which is a combination of genetic information and tissue and all these things, and that starts to grow and to become a fetus, which will one day when it is born become a baby.

101
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right, so the embryo is basically the first stage of when the baby is forming.

102
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But it's not really, as you say this word fetus, it's not in our dialogue, but a fetus is actually a formed being, so to say, inside a woman's body, right?

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's growing, it's starting to get the pieces that it needs to become a human being, but maybe has not fully developed yet, so it's still inside the woman's womb, we can say.

104
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Very good.

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay, a lot of interesting things going on, why don't we listen to our dialogue again and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

106
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life.

107
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I'm sure that some of the things we will be talking about today may surprise you.

108
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Billy, can you turn on the projector please?

109
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Thanks.

110
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, does anyone know what this is?

111
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Looks like a goat head to me.

112
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Nice try, but this is a woman's womb, which contains her uterus and ovaries.

113
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The ovaries are packed with eggs, and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes.

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is called ovulation, and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of a woman's cycle.

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days.

116
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Counting day one as the first day of your last period.

117
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's amazing!

118
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So each month the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Actually, every woman is already born with over 400,000 eggs.

120
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Some will start dying off immediately and others are released during her fertile period.

121
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What about the guys?

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I know they produce sperm and stuff.

123
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's right.

124
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm 24 hours a day.

125
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Each ejaculation will release about 100 million sperm, so the factory is always pretty busy.

126
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

127
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So then we basically need to put one and one together so we can have babies, right?

128
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

129
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.

130
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes.

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 12 hours.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Not all of them make it since some of them go the wrong way and get lost or simply die.

133
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it.

134
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.

135
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And then that's it?

136
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release.

137
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing.

138
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells known as the embryo travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

139
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Any other questions?

140
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then let's move on.

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
All right, so this whole aspect, we understand how the miracle of life works, right?

142
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is what it's called having babies, the miracle of life.

143
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's even the name of a video we were forced to watch when I was 12 years old and I still have nightmares about.

144
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Well, it is interesting.

145
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It is almost a miracle because you are basically creating something out of nothing almost, right?

146
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's right.

147
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And what's amazing about it is that two people who have different genetic material and who have different experiences and who have different parts to their bodies come together and create something that's a combination of all those things.

148
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So it's almost kind of like a game of surprise.

149
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You don't know what's going to happen.

150
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Are they going to have red hair or green eyes or are they going to be tall or short or fat or thin?

151
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's interesting.

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Now, talking about this aspect that you mentioned before, it's controversial when there is life or when if the embryo is a baby or it's not.

153
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is because of many countries or cities or states that are discussing the legalization or not of abortions.

154
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's right.

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So the reason this is a problem for a lot of people is because no one agrees on when a fetus becomes a baby.

156
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And so that will determine for a lot of people when it is okay to abort the fetus or to kill it and when it is not.

157
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Right.

158
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because I've heard that some people say, well, in your first month, if you've already been pregnant for a month, the baby already has certain parts formed or even I think the heart's beginning to form.

159
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So they say you're already pregnant.

160
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I mean, you already have a life inside you.

161
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, they'll say, well, no, it's actually after two months because then the baby has a heartbeat.

162
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm not really sure about the time tables that I'm giving you.

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm giving you more or less a rough outline, but this is the controversy.

164
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's right.

165
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And so it affects laws in many countries.

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It affects what medical practitioners like doctors and nurses can do.

167
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And it's always, I think, been an issue as long as I've been alive.

168
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Actually, the whole abortion topic is a big political debate between people who are against it, who are in favor of it.

170
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So it's very interesting.

171
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And actually, it's still very much illegal in many places in the world.

172
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And it changes, I think, according to where you are in America as well.

173
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So some states have different laws about it and some states are more lenient, for example.

174
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And actually, this spawned a whole new controversy that with the emergency pill, that basically if you maybe are in risk of being pregnant, then you take this pill and it kind of prevents fertilization or if fertilization occurred already, then it kind of prevents further growth of the embryo.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Basically, it's called the emergency contraceptive and it's taken after you think you might be pregnant.

176
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So maybe if you didn't use other contraceptives like a condom and you think maybe one of your eggs as a woman was fertilized by sperm, it makes you have your period, it makes you menstruate.

177
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That means your whole, the lining of your uterus and any egg, even if it was fertilized, comes out.

178
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And it's, in some cases, people think of it as a kind of abortion.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's right.

180
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So yeah, it's very interesting how the more that we understand about medicine and about how life works, well, there have been advancements as well, like contraceptives that not only prevent unwanted pregnancies, but also prevent transmission of diseases, sexually transmitted diseases.

181
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But at the same time, other things like this, like the emergency contraceptive and abortions start popping up.

182
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Ethics.

183
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ethics, exactly.

184
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So a very interesting topic, as we said, controversial, but at the same time, very much beautiful because we are talking about how our bodies work and how everyone came to existence.

185
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And how babies are born.

186
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Everyone loves babies.

187
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's right.

188
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
