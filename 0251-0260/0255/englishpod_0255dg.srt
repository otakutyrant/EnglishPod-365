EnglishPod.com Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,679
Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I'm sure that some of the things we will be talking about today may surprise you.

3
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,219
Billy, can you turn on the projector please?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,260
Thanks.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,199
Okay, does anyone know what this is?

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,199
Looks like a goat head to me.

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,759
Nice try, but this is a woman's womb which contains her uterus and ovaries.

8
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:41,479
The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes.

9
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,100
This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of a woman's cycle.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,200
In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,880
Counting day one as the first day of your last period.

12
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,200
That's amazing!

13
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,959
So each month the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?

14
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:10,780
Actually, every woman is already born with over 400,000 eggs.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,840
Some will start dying off immediately and others are released during her fertile period.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,120
What about the guys?

17
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,459
I know they produce sperm and stuff.

18
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,359
That's right.

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,500
The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm 24 hours a day.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,819
Each ejaculation will release about 100 million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,120
The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,439
So then we basically need to put one and one together so we can have babies, right?

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,239
Yes.

24
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,780
The man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:55,920
Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes.

26
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,099
This could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 12 hours.

27
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,879
Not all of them make it since some of them go the wrong way and get lost or simply die.

28
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,280
Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,060
Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.

30
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,759
And then that's it?

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,860
Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,139
The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing.

33
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:45,960
The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells known as the embryo travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,819
Any other questions?

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,639
Then let's move on.
