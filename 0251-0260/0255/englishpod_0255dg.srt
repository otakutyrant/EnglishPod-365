EnglishPod.com Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I'm sure that some of the things we will be talking about today may surprise you.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Billy, can you turn on the projector please?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thanks.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay, does anyone know what this is?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Looks like a goat head to me.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Nice try, but this is a woman's womb which contains her uterus and ovaries.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of a woman's cycle.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Counting day one as the first day of your last period.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's amazing!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So each month the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Actually, every woman is already born with over 400,000 eggs.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Some will start dying off immediately and others are released during her fertile period.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What about the guys?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I know they produce sperm and stuff.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The man's body has a tiny factory that produces sperm 24 hours a day.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Each ejaculation will release about 100 million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The sole purpose of a sperm's life is to fertilize the woman's egg.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So then we basically need to put one and one together so we can have babies, right?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix through the uterus and to the fallopian tubes.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 12 hours.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Not all of them make it since some of them go the wrong way and get lost or simply die.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then that's it?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells known as the embryo travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Any other questions?

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then let's move on.
