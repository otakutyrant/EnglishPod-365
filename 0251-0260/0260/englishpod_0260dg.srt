EnglishPod.com Hey Nick!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What are you up to?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Not much.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Just heading over to the shooting range.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You wanna come?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Seriously?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You mean to fire a real weapon?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know man.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, it will be fun!

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I also have a revolver that's really fun too.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, that would be cool.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Or what about a flamethrower?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Whoa!

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Take it easy there Rambo.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't get carried away.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger unless you are ready to shoot.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wow!

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I didn't know.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The reality is different you know.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, are you ready?

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's do it!
