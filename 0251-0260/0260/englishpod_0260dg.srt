EnglishPod.com Hey Nick!

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,759
What are you up to?

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,740
Not much.

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,320
Just heading over to the shooting range.

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,019
You wanna come?

6
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,359
Seriously?

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:19,179
You mean to fire a real weapon?

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,739
I don't know man.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,160
Yeah, it will be fun!

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,100
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,739
I also have a revolver that's really fun too.

12
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,460
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,619
Yeah, that would be cool.

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,320
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun.

15
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,859
Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile.

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:44,259
Or what about a flamethrower?

17
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:45,420
Whoa!

18
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:46,899
Take it easy there Rambo.

19
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:48,200
Don't get carried away.

20
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:52,020
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,500
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

22
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,439
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,099
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger unless you are ready to shoot.

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,280
Wow!

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,239
I didn't know.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,040
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,060
The reality is different you know.

28
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,859
Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

29
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,299
So, are you ready?

30
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,359
Let's do it!
