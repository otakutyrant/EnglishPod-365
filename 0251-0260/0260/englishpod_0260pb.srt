00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:04,360
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,279
My name is Katherine, and today we have a very dangerous lesson for you guys.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:09,859
That's right.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,660
Today we're going to talk about guns, or specifically about weapons.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,339
So, yeah, we're talking about kinds of guns.

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,839
There are more than I think I ever knew, and we're going to discuss about six today.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,460
But before we get going, Marco, we've got a phrase in Vocabulary Preview.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,019
That's right.

10
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,539
So today on Vocabulary Preview, we're going to take a look at shooting range.

11
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,239
Have you ever been to one of these places?

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,940
Yes, a shooting range.

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:42,140
It's a place, like you say, and it's a place where you can fire your weapons or you can use guns safely so you don't kill anyone or you don't hurt someone.

14
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,299
No, basically, yeah, it's a place to practice shooting.

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:53,700
So maybe, for example, if you want to practice how to shoot guns, you go to this place and they have special things to help you improve your shooting abilities.

16
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,979
Usually these are very, very secure.

17
00:00:56,979 --> 00:01:00,299
They have guards and things because you don't want to give the guns out to anybody.

18
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:00,899
That's right.

19
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,879
But let's listen to today's dialogue about a shooting range and find out what kinds of guns they have.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,099
Hey, Nick, what are you up to?

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,019
Not much.

22
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,620
Just heading over to the shooting range.

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,340
You want to come?

24
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:21,599
Seriously?

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,420
You mean to fire a real weapon?

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,980
I don't know, man.

27
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,420
Yeah, it will be fun.

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,340
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,280
I also have a revolver that's really fun, too.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,700
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

31
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,879
Yeah, that would be cool.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:49,760
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun, maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile or what about a flame thrower?

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,159
Whoa, take it easy there, Rambo.

34
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,480
Don't get carried away.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,280
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

37
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,700
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,319
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger unless you are ready to shoot.

39
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,500
Wow, I didn't know.

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,300
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

41
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,300
The reality is different, you know.

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,120
Running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,560
So, are you ready?

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,659
Let's do it!

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:37,960
Alright, we're back, so obviously this guy was very excited about using these weapons and you may have heard that we're using this word, weapons.

46
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:43,719
It's basically all of these things, I guess anything that can be used in defense or hurt someone.

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, anything that can be used to hurt someone is a weapon.

48
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,639
So a knife can be a weapon, not just guns.

49
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:49,879
Guns are a kind of weapon.

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:50,620
That's right.

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,439
So, taking a look at our first type of gun, or our first type of weapon, we have a 9mm pistol.

52
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:06,900
Okay, so the weapon is the pistol, and the pistol is basically a handgun, but it comes in different sizes, so that's what the 9mm refers to.

53
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,680
That's right, that's the size of the projectile that will come out of the weapon.

54
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:25,740
And a pistol, as you said, it's a handgun, it's usually small, and it can fit in your Okay, so there's a similar handgun that's a little bit bigger, that's called a revolver.

55
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,659
That's right, a revolver.

56
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:35,680
So this one has a revolving chamber, so you kind of see this in the old western movies when they would have six bullets, right?

57
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,199
And they like swing their guns into their side holsters.

58
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:39,639
Yeah.

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Well yeah, that's right, the revolver refers to, well, to revolve, it means to move around, to spin.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,479
That's right.

61
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,199
And so the place with the bullets basically spins after you shoot the gun.

62
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:59,500
That's right, so that's why it's called a revolver, unlike the pistol, the pistol will usually not really have a revolver, it will have a magazine.

63
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:06,580
Okay, now moving on to our next type of weapon, we have the very famous machine gun.

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:19,199
That's the one that shoots off really fast, and so basically it's called a machine gun because it's automatically releasing all these bullets at once, you just pull the trigger and many many many bullets come out.

65
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:30,639
That's right, so in a pistol or in a revolver usually you have to press the trigger once and it shoots only once, but in a machine gun you can keep it pressed and all these bullets will start flying out.

66
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:31,600
Very very dangerous.

67
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,160
Very dangerous, okay.

68
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,139
So now moving on to the next one, we also took a look at a shotgun.

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,300
Okay this is, well this is not the biggest gun we're going to talk about today, but it's a very large gun, very long, and you have to use two hands to hold it.

70
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,980
This is what you usually use when you go hunting, right?

71
00:04:48,220 --> 00:05:08,540
That's right, so as you said it's a very long gun, it's very loud, and it doesn't really shoot bullets, it shoots little pellets, little cartridges that are filled with little rocks for example, and that's what it shoots, and this is why it's not very precise like a machine gun or a handgun, but it does a lot of damage.

72
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,300
Absolutely, and what's something else that does a lot of damage, our next gun will do that.

73
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,959
Well this guy got a little bit excited and he said he wanted to use a rocket launcher.

74
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:27,439
Okay so you know what a rocket is, a rocket is something that's basically a projectile that goes into the sky and can basically blow up big buildings or cars.

75
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:30,279
That's right, and that's what a rocket launcher is.

76
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,720
Now maybe you've heard of the word bazooka, a bazooka is a type of rocket launcher.

77
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:49,500
It's very, very, very wide and it's circular, and you usually see it in movies like Rambo we talked about, where Rambo will hold it on one shoulder, it's so big, and the rocket shoots out and can destroy huge buildings.

78
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,899
That's exactly right, so that's why it's called a rocket launcher.

79
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,060
Now for our last type of weapon, we have a flame thrower.

80
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:14,660
Okay well a flame refers to fire, so fire has flames, those are the parts that kind of come up on a fire, the red and orange, and a flame thrower is a device, is a weapon that will shoot flames, not bullets.

81
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:36,519
It was very popular back in World War II to actually shoot the flame thrower into bunkers or into holes because then you know this is how you can get people out of there, and I think flame throwers are used now to some sort of degree like to fumigate sometimes or to burn weeds when you're in a field.

82
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,800
Right, they're not really used as weapons anymore, although I think I've seen a number of them in action movies.

83
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,939
Really, in action movies of course.

84
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:53,819
So we have a lot of guns, a lot of different types of weapons, why don't we go back to the dialogue, let's listen to it again, and we'll be back soon with Fluency Builder.

85
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,279
Hey Nick, what are you up to?

86
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:10,519
Not much, just heading over to the shooting range, you want to come?

87
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,819
Seriously?

88
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,639
You mean to fire a real weapon?

89
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,199
I don't know man.

90
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:26,920
Yeah, it will be fun, I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot, I also have a revolver that's really fun too, they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

91
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:39,939
Yeah, that would be cool, maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun, or a shotgun, maybe even a rocket launcher, or an anti-tank missile, or what about a flame thrower?

92
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:50,980
Woah, take it easy there Rambo, don't get carried away, these weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly, there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

93
00:07:51,839 --> 00:08:00,540
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself, always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger unless you are ready to shoot.

94
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,579
Wow, I didn't know, it always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

95
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,339
The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

96
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,779
So, are you ready?

97
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,319
Let's do it!

98
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,500
Alright we're back so now let's take a look at our phrases that we've picked out for you on Fluency Builder.

99
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:36,759
Fluency Builder So this first phrase comes from the beginning of today's dialogue when Nick is saying, well I'm not doing much, I'm just heading over to the shooting range.

100
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,820
That's right, so we know what shooting range is, but when he says I'm heading over to the shooting range.

101
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,019
Well this can be confusing because to head over has nothing to do with the head on your body.

102
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,440
Right.

103
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:52,159
It means I'm going towards some place, I'm going to this place.

104
00:08:52,419 --> 00:08:55,419
So it's just another way of saying going to, right?

105
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:59,740
So for example you can say, I'm heading over to my friend's house this afternoon.

106
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,899
That's right, so I'm going to my friend's house this afternoon.

107
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:10,480
But remember that this is a pretty relaxed, pretty informal way of saying something so you wouldn't say I'm heading over to work.

108
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,000
Right.

109
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:16,220
You say hey I'm heading over to his house to hang out or I'm heading over to the pizza restaurant to grab a bite to eat.

110
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,500
That's right, okay.

111
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:27,059
So now obviously we saw that one of the guys got very excited about the idea of using all these cool weapons and his friend said, whoa, take it easy there Rambo.

112
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,980
Don't get carried away.

113
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,200
I love this phrase.

114
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,659
This phrase is something you say to someone who is maybe too excited about something.

115
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,720
That's right.

116
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:37,440
It means don't go crazy.

117
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,860
Don't exaggerate.

118
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:48,379
Right, so maybe at the shooting range they'll have a revolver and they'll have a pistol, but they're probably not going to have a rocket launcher or as he said an anti-tank missile.

119
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,620
These are crazy weapons from movies.

120
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,159
And so the friend is saying no, you're exaggerating, don't get carried away.

121
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:05,379
Now for example maybe you go to the mall and you go shopping and maybe you got a little bit carried away and you spent too much money.

122
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,159
That always happens to me during the holidays.

123
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,379
I get carried away and I buy way too much stuff.

124
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,059
That's right.

125
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,559
So that's the way that you would use carried away.

126
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,559
And now for our last phrase.

127
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:25,360
He was actually explaining a couple of rules of weapon handling and he said that there are some rules that he has to abide by.

128
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,399
Okay so this is a fixed phrase.

129
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,379
We use the verb to abide with the word like the rules.

130
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,799
So to abide by the rules or we must all abide by the rules.

131
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,019
This is a fancy way of saying to follow the rules or to recognize the rules.

132
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:40,940
That's right.

133
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:49,059
So you have to abide by the rules of your school or maybe you have to, everyone has to abide by the law.

134
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,059
Right, or some people can say there are rules in the Bible that other people abide by.

135
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:54,899
That's right.

136
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,899
Okay so a lot of great stuff.

137
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,220
I think we've taken a look at a lot of different types of weapons and phrases.

138
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,200
So pretty interesting stuff, why don't we listen to it for the last time.

139
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,000
Hey Nick, what are you up to?

140
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,259
Not much, just heading over to the shooting range, you want to come?

141
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,580
Seriously?

142
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,399
You mean to fire a real weapon?

143
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:23,960
I don't know man.

144
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:25,379
Yeah, it will be fun.

145
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:28,299
I have a 9mm pistol that's really easy to shoot.

146
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,960
I also have a revolver that's really fun too.

147
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,659
They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.

148
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,860
Yeah, that would be cool.

149
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,519
Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun.

150
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,100
Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti-tank missile.

151
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,659
Or what about a flame thrower?

152
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,120
Whoa, take it easy there Rambo.

153
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,419
Don't get carried away.

154
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,240
These weapons are not toys and you must first learn how to handle them properly.

155
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:58,700
There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe.

156
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,679
For example, never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself.

157
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:08,340
Always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber and never put your finger to the trigger unless you are ready to shoot.

158
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,460
Wow, I didn't know.

159
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,299
It always looks so cool and easy in the movies.

160
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,080
The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies.

161
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,519
So, are you ready?

162
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,980
Let's do it!

163
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,419
Alright, we're back.

164
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,000
So, talking about weapons and pistols and all this, have you ever used one of these?

165
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:31,480
Have you ever?

166
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,000
I have.

167
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,840
I have been to a couple shooting ranges and have fired a couple of guns.

168
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,039
I've never fired a shotgun.

169
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:41,659
They don't usually, well sometimes they have shotguns.

170
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,899
But I've shot pistols before.

171
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,419
Did you like it?

172
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,139
I like it.

173
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,600
It's an interesting activity.

174
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:56,200
I don't know how I feel about using guns on people, but I understand why hunting is an enjoyable sport.

175
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,460
Because there is a sport aspect to it.

176
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,980
You know, you really have to control your body and you can improve.

177
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,500
You can get better.

178
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,639
It's like darts but with loud guns.

179
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,460
And it's very hard to aim actually to hit something.

180
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,500
People think it's very easy like in the movies.

181
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,899
Well and I think it's particularly hard with handguns.

182
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:16,460
Yes.

183
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:27,620
Because some of them can be very powerful and so there's a kick and you don't realize that the first time you shoot a gun you're like, oh that was way harder than it looks in the movies.

184
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,500
I bet you're a good shot, right?

185
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

186
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,639
I've always really enjoyed weapons and my aim is alright.

187
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,720
Although my eyesight kind of, I need to use glasses so it can be a little bit tricky sometimes.

188
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,799
Especially when you shoot a weapon sometimes it's very, you just cleaned it so it has a lot of oil and it'll kick out into your face and get your glasses wet.

189
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,019
Well that's why we use goggles at the shooting ranges that I go to.

190
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,299
But I'm curious to know, have you guys ever shot a gun before?

191
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,899
Have you ever been to a shooting range?

192
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,059
Are shooting ranges legal in your country?

193
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:00,100
Yeah, some places they're not.

194
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:01,240
Yeah, so let us know.

195
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,700
