00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,879
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,660
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,820
My name is Catherine and you've been with us for a little while.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,580
You've probably heard some of our interview series already.

5
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:13,820
Well, this is one of the later episodes in that series.

6
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:14,259
That's right.

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,619
We're at part number nine.

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:25,199
We're reaching the end of our interview and on this occasion, we're going to ask our employer a little bit of more information about the company and more importantly, about the job.

9
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,899
Well, this is a very important step.

10
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,940
Like you say, it's at the end of the interview, so we're going to find out more details about the job.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,799
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,960
We'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,020
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,939
For example, how big is your office here?

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,759
Well, in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

16
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,320
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,100
I see.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,399
And how about the working hours?

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,219
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly nine to five.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,340
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,840
Well, I'm used to that, Mr.

22
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:18,019
Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,359
Good, as long as you understand that.

24
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,780
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr.

25
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,140
Parsons?

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,340
Yesterday, but no.

27
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,439
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,680
That sounds like deal.

29
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:42,980
Alright, we're back, so it's obviously a very difficult job, and she asked some very key questions, so why don't we take a look at a couple of the words and phrases used there on Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,879
The first word that we have here for Language Takeaway is workforce.

31
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right, a workforce, the company's workforce.

32
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,780
And that basically means all the employees that we have working for us.

33
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:01,340
That might not be in one office.

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:01,760
That's right.

35
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,659
Many companies have two, three, even a hundred offices, so the workforce means all the people who work for the company combined.

36
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
That's right, so a workforce.

37
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:25,759
And, well, she asked about the workforce, and, well, it's obviously a pretty big company, 150 employees, but he also mentioned that the news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 people, or 80 staff.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,960
So, this verb, to comprise, or in this case, it comprises, means to make up, or to account for.

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,979
It's a very nice word to say, it accounts for, it makes up, it's the total.

40
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:42,039
It's the total, right.

41
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,819
So, in this case, the news desk staff has 80 people.

42
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,599
That's a very easy way to say it, but we could say it comprises 80 people.

43
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,539
It sounds a bit better.

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,780
That's right, very good.

45
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,939
So, now, obviously, she's going to be a reporter or a journalist, and he said that she should be on call at any time.

46
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,979
Okay, on call is a phrase that we often hear with jobs like journalism, but also medicine.

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,379
So, doctors have to be on call very often.

48
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:15,460
This means that you don't have to be in the office, but you have to be available to come into the office.

49
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,379
So, when someone calls you, and they say, we have an emergency, you have to be available.

50
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:22,939
That's right, and you see it in movies all the time.

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:32,840
You know, doctors are on call, and maybe they're already sleeping, or maybe they're out, I don't know, playing soccer with their kids, and they receive a phone call, and they have to go to the hospital in that moment.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
That's because they're on call.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,680
That's because they're on call, very good.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:44,560
So, obviously, this is a very difficult thing for someone, and he explains that the work has very unsociable hours at times.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Okay, so you can say that the hours are unsociable.

56
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,039
You can also say that a person is unsociable.

57
00:03:50,340 --> 00:04:02,879
It basically means that it's not very convenient for being a social person or for going out with friends and having many events to go to or fun things to do in your personal life.

58
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,439
That's right.

59
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:12,919
So, if a person is unsociable, it means that maybe that person is not very outgoing, or maybe he's always angry or grumpy, so that person doesn't get along well with others.

60
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,259
Right, but in this case, it doesn't mean that it's a grumpy job.

61
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:22,699
It just means that because she might have to work at night very often or on the weekends, it's very hard to have a social life.

62
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,339
That's right.

63
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:32,019
Okay, so obviously, this job is very difficult, but in the end, she was really happy with it, and she said that sounds ideal, her starting time.

64
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:37,199
So, something that is ideal if it's perfect or great or the top.

65
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,160
That's right.

66
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,259
Many people talk about the ideal job, right?

67
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,220
The perfect job.

68
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:46,259
So, that's the job that you have in your mind when you think of what is the best.

69
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

70
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,019
So, maybe my ideal job is different from your ideal job.

71
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,600
That's right.

72
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,759
So, you have ideal jobs or your ideal house or your dream house.

73
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,879
Your ideal husband.

74
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:56,680
That's right.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,740
So, ideal.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,480
Idealism.

77
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,100
So, why don't we listen to the dialogue again.

78
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,240
Let's review what Rebecca and Mr.

79
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:06,000
Parsons talked about, and we'll be back in a little bit with Fluency Builder.

80
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,980
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

81
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,819
For example, how big is your office here?

82
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,680
Well, in total, we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong, with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,180
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

84
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:29,040
I see.

85
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
And how about the working hours?

86
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,180
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly 9 to 5.

87
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,279
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

88
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,779
Well, I'm used to that, Mr.

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,959
Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,259
Good, as long as you understand that.

91
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,720
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr.

92
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Parsons?

93
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,300
Yesterday, but no.

94
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,339
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

95
00:05:57,339 --> 00:05:58,579
That sounds ideal.

96
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,319
All right, we're back.

97
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,740
So now we have four phrases for you prepared on Fluency Builder.

98
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,139
This first phrase is something that we say all the time in English, but I think a lot of learners make mistakes when they use it.

99
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,000
The phrase is, how about.

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,060
That's right.

101
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,980
So you see that Rebecca was listening to what Mr.

102
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,420
Parsons said, and she said, and how about the working hours?

103
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,959
So this is a way to say, and what are the working hours?

104
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,060
But basically it's a way to continue the conversation.

105
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,579
You can say this in many different ways, but it basically means, and what about, or please tell me about.

106
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,379
That's right.

107
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:47,819
Now remember that many English learners mistake the phrase how about as if they were saying how are you or how is it.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,259
No.

109
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:48,920
Okay.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,160
You have to be following someone else in the conversation.

111
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:56,040
So for example, I could say, you know what, I'm going to have a hamburger with bacon.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,060
How about you, Marco?

113
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:57,740
What are you going to eat?

114
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,579
How about you buy me a cheeseburger?

115
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,500
Okay.

116
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:09,339
So this is basically a way of saying, okay, well, maybe I'll have a cheeseburger or what are you going to have?

117
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,800
So now it's important to say, don't ever make this question.

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,060
Don't ever ask, how about your weekend?

119
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,199
No, no, no, no, no.

120
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,779
How was your weekend?

121
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,360
That's right.

122
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:21,839
My weekend was great.

123
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,939
How about yours?

124
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,959
How about yours?

125
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:27,560
That's continuing the conversation saying mine was good.

126
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:28,839
How was yours?

127
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

128
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,459
So remember that when they were talking about the work hours, he said that the work hours are not exactly nine to five.

129
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,079
Okay.

130
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:44,540
So this is a kind of a set phrase we use often in English because a lot of people traditionally have worked from 9 a.m.

131
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,839
to 5 p.m.

132
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:47,839
They have a break at lunch, then they go home.

133
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,399
That's right.

134
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,040
So this is a kind of measure for this is a way to describe traditional working hours or traditional jobs.

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,540
So you can say, yeah, I have a really nice nine to five job.

136
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,680
You could say, I really don't want to work a nine to five job.

137
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,300
That's right.

138
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,540
So you don't want a traditional job where you're working from nine to five.

139
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:05,800
Right.

140
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,360
Most people I think work a little bit longer than that, but this is just a way of saying a traditional job.

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,040
That's right.

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,879
Okay.

143
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
Nine to five job.

144
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,199
Now why don't we move on to Rebecca saying that she is used to working long hours or being on call.

145
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:21,839
Right.

146
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:29,319
So this construction to be used to, I'm used to doing this, is a way to say that I already do this.

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,000
This is my experience or I have the habit of working unusual hours.

148
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,620
That's right.

149
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:43,820
So maybe, for example, you live in a very noisy area in your neighborhood and somebody comes and visits you and they can't sleep because it's so noisy.

150
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,179
You're used to it.

151
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,399
You say, oh, I don't mind.

152
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,860
I'm used to the noise.

153
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,759
But your friend who's visiting is not used to it.

154
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,139
Right.

155
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,379
They don't have this noise at home, so.

156
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,399
That's what happens and they can't sleep.

157
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,419
So when you are used to something, you have the habit or you're accustomed to it.

158
00:08:59,500 --> 00:08:59,820
That's right.

159
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,379
Okay.

160
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,980
And what about our last phrase?

161
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:06,799
Our last phrase comes at the end and Rebecca is talking about the start date for this job.

162
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,879
She wants to know, when do you need to fill the vacancy?

163
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:10,659
Okay.

164
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,080
To fill the vacancy.

165
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,100
Now we have this word vacancy and that means that it's available, right?

166
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:16,620
That's right.

167
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,399
So vacancy is an available thing.

168
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,580
It could be a vacant place.

169
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:23,639
Like an apartment.

170
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,299
Like an apartment.

171
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,179
Or in this case, a vacancy in a company.

172
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,100
That means a job that is available.

173
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:29,799
That's right.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,059
So she is asking when she can fill the vacancy.

175
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,960
So we use the verb fill to fill a vacancy.

176
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,659
And this sounds a lot better than saying, hey, when do I start working here?

177
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,279
Right.

178
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,980
This is a polite way to say, you know, when is the job going to begin?

179
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,820
When do you need to fill the vacancy by?

180
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,059
I guess another way of saying it would be, when is the starting date?

181
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:51,899
Okay.

182
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,580
But as we say, also fill the vacancy is a very good option.

183
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,039
But don't say, when do I start working?

184
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:58,940
Or when do we start?

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,620
Yeah, no.

186
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,720
We can talk about that in a minute.

187
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,320
Let's listen first to our dialogue one more time.

188
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:04,000
We'll be back shortly.

189
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,340
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

190
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,159
For example, how big is your office here?

191
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:24,039
Well, in total, we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong, with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

192
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:28,559
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

193
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:29,419
I see.

194
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,720
And how about the working hours?

195
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:37,559
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly nine to five.

196
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,679
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

197
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,179
Well, I'm used to that, Mr.

198
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,399
Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

199
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,639
Good, as long as you understand that.

200
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:52,080
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr.

201
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,460
Parsons?

202
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,659
Yesterday, but no.

203
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,720
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

204
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:58,940
That sounds ideal.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,919
So talking about working hours, being on call, or unsociable working hours, have you ever had a job where you've had to work maybe through the night?

206
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,159
Yes, I used to work in a movie theater when I was in college.

207
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,080
I had a day job, too, so it was kind of a mess.

208
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,539
I was very unsociable.

209
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,419
But I worked at a movie theater, and I would start working at 6 p.m., or 5 p.m., and I would work until 2 or 3 a.m.

210
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,720
And so it was always busiest on Friday and Saturday, and so I could never go out with my friends.

211
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,200
Right, so while everyone was partying, you were at the movie theater.

212
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,240
Exactly, or they would come to the movies, and I would sneak in and bring them popcorn.

213
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:44,080
So these unusual working hours, it's very interesting because usually, although it is a little bit more of a sacrifice, they usually pay a little bit better, right?

214
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,100
They do, and there are some advantages.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,080
It means that you get to sleep in really late.

216
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:50,659
You don't have to wake up early.

217
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,080
And you have the day off, like the entire day to do something.

218
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:53,519
Exactly.

219
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:54,559
What about you?

220
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
Have you ever worked unusual hours?

221
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,159
Yes, I used to work for a newspaper, and obviously people like their newspaper in the mornings.

222
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,940
Bright and early.

223
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,779
Bright and early.

224
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:06,820
We're talking about 6 a.m.

225
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,879
So obviously we would deliver the newspapers around 1 a.m., 2 a.m., from 1 a.m.

226
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,179
to about 6 a.m.

227
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,259
So yeah, pretty unusual and very difficult because, for example, for some people, for them it's great to see the sunrise.

228
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:24,559
I've seen so many sunrises, and it's not really romantic for me anymore.

229
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,519
We would call you a night owl, someone who's more awake at night.

230
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,860
That's right, and I still am.

231
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,820
So we were really interested to know maybe if you had any unusual working hours.

232
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:36,620
Or do you work a 9 to 5?

233
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,500
Yeah, do you have a 9 to 5 job?

234
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,860
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com, let us know, and we'll see everyone there.

235
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,320
Bye.
