00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everyone and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine and you've been with us for a little while.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You've probably heard some of our interview series already.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, this is one of the later episodes in that series.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're at part number nine.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're reaching the end of our interview and on this occasion, we're going to ask our employer a little bit of more information about the company and more importantly, about the job.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, this is a very important step.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Like you say, it's at the end of the interview, so we're going to find out more details about the job.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's take a listen to today's dialogue.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For example, how big is your office here?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And how about the working hours?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly nine to five.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, I'm used to that, Mr.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Good, as long as you understand that.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Parsons?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yesterday, but no.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That sounds like deal.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright, we're back, so it's obviously a very difficult job, and she asked some very key questions, so why don't we take a look at a couple of the words and phrases used there on Language Takeaway.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The first word that we have here for Language Takeaway is workforce.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right, a workforce, the company's workforce.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And that basically means all the employees that we have working for us.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That might not be in one office.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's right.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Many companies have two, three, even a hundred offices, so the workforce means all the people who work for the company combined.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's right, so a workforce.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And, well, she asked about the workforce, and, well, it's obviously a pretty big company, 150 employees, but he also mentioned that the news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 people, or 80 staff.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, this verb, to comprise, or in this case, it comprises, means to make up, or to account for.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a very nice word to say, it accounts for, it makes up, it's the total.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's the total, right.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So, in this case, the news desk staff has 80 people.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's a very easy way to say it, but we could say it comprises 80 people.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It sounds a bit better.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's right, very good.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So, now, obviously, she's going to be a reporter or a journalist, and he said that she should be on call at any time.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, on call is a phrase that we often hear with jobs like journalism, but also medicine.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, doctors have to be on call very often.

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This means that you don't have to be in the office, but you have to be available to come into the office.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So, when someone calls you, and they say, we have an emergency, you have to be available.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's right, and you see it in movies all the time.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You know, doctors are on call, and maybe they're already sleeping, or maybe they're out, I don't know, playing soccer with their kids, and they receive a phone call, and they have to go to the hospital in that moment.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's because they're on call.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's because they're on call, very good.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So, obviously, this is a very difficult thing for someone, and he explains that the work has very unsociable hours at times.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay, so you can say that the hours are unsociable.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can also say that a person is unsociable.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It basically means that it's not very convenient for being a social person or for going out with friends and having many events to go to or fun things to do in your personal life.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So, if a person is unsociable, it means that maybe that person is not very outgoing, or maybe he's always angry or grumpy, so that person doesn't get along well with others.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Right, but in this case, it doesn't mean that it's a grumpy job.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It just means that because she might have to work at night very often or on the weekends, it's very hard to have a social life.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, so obviously, this job is very difficult, but in the end, she was really happy with it, and she said that sounds ideal, her starting time.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, something that is ideal if it's perfect or great or the top.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Many people talk about the ideal job, right?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The perfect job.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So, that's the job that you have in your mind when you think of what is the best.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So, maybe my ideal job is different from your ideal job.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So, you have ideal jobs or your ideal house or your dream house.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your ideal husband.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, ideal.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Idealism.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So, why don't we listen to the dialogue again.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's review what Rebecca and Mr.

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Parsons talked about, and we'll be back in a little bit with Fluency Builder.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
For example, how big is your office here?

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, in total, we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong, with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I see.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And how about the working hours?

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly 9 to 5.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, I'm used to that, Mr.

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good, as long as you understand that.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Parsons?

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yesterday, but no.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That sounds ideal.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
All right, we're back.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So now we have four phrases for you prepared on Fluency Builder.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This first phrase is something that we say all the time in English, but I think a lot of learners make mistakes when they use it.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The phrase is, how about.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right.

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So you see that Rebecca was listening to what Mr.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Parsons said, and she said, and how about the working hours?

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So this is a way to say, and what are the working hours?

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But basically it's a way to continue the conversation.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You can say this in many different ways, but it basically means, and what about, or please tell me about.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now remember that many English learners mistake the phrase how about as if they were saying how are you or how is it.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You have to be following someone else in the conversation.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So for example, I could say, you know what, I'm going to have a hamburger with bacon.

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How about you, Marco?

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you going to eat?

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How about you buy me a cheeseburger?

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Okay.

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So this is basically a way of saying, okay, well, maybe I'll have a cheeseburger or what are you going to have?

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So now it's important to say, don't ever make this question.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't ever ask, how about your weekend?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No, no, no, no, no.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How was your weekend?

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
My weekend was great.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,000
How about yours?

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,000
How about yours?

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's continuing the conversation saying mine was good.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How was yours?

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So remember that when they were talking about the work hours, he said that the work hours are not exactly nine to five.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So this is a kind of a set phrase we use often in English because a lot of people traditionally have worked from 9 a.m.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
to 5 p.m.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
They have a break at lunch, then they go home.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So this is a kind of measure for this is a way to describe traditional working hours or traditional jobs.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So you can say, yeah, I have a really nice nine to five job.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You could say, I really don't want to work a nine to five job.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's right.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So you don't want a traditional job where you're working from nine to five.

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Right.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Most people I think work a little bit longer than that, but this is just a way of saying a traditional job.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Nine to five job.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Now why don't we move on to Rebecca saying that she is used to working long hours or being on call.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Right.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So this construction to be used to, I'm used to doing this, is a way to say that I already do this.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is my experience or I have the habit of working unusual hours.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's right.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So maybe, for example, you live in a very noisy area in your neighborhood and somebody comes and visits you and they can't sleep because it's so noisy.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're used to it.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You say, oh, I don't mind.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm used to the noise.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But your friend who's visiting is not used to it.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Right.

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They don't have this noise at home, so.

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's what happens and they can't sleep.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So when you are used to something, you have the habit or you're accustomed to it.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's right.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay.

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And what about our last phrase?

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Our last phrase comes at the end and Rebecca is talking about the start date for this job.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She wants to know, when do you need to fill the vacancy?

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
To fill the vacancy.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Now we have this word vacancy and that means that it's available, right?

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's right.

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So vacancy is an available thing.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It could be a vacant place.

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Like an apartment.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Like an apartment.

171
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Or in this case, a vacancy in a company.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That means a job that is available.

173
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's right.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So she is asking when she can fill the vacancy.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So we use the verb fill to fill a vacancy.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And this sounds a lot better than saying, hey, when do I start working here?

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is a polite way to say, you know, when is the job going to begin?

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
When do you need to fill the vacancy by?

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I guess another way of saying it would be, when is the starting date?

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Okay.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But as we say, also fill the vacancy is a very good option.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But don't say, when do I start working?

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Or when do we start?

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, no.

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We can talk about that in a minute.

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Let's listen first to our dialogue one more time.

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We'll be back shortly.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Could you tell me a little about the organization?

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
For example, how big is your office here?

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Well, in total, we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong, with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I see.

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And how about the working hours?

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism, work hours are not exactly nine to five.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You could be on call at any time, but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, I'm used to that, Mr.

198
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Good, as long as you understand that.

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr.

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Parsons?

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yesterday, but no.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That sounds ideal.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So talking about working hours, being on call, or unsociable working hours, have you ever had a job where you've had to work maybe through the night?

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes, I used to work in a movie theater when I was in college.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I had a day job, too, so it was kind of a mess.

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was very unsociable.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But I worked at a movie theater, and I would start working at 6 p.m., or 5 p.m., and I would work until 2 or 3 a.m.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And so it was always busiest on Friday and Saturday, and so I could never go out with my friends.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Right, so while everyone was partying, you were at the movie theater.

212
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Exactly, or they would come to the movies, and I would sneak in and bring them popcorn.

213
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So these unusual working hours, it's very interesting because usually, although it is a little bit more of a sacrifice, they usually pay a little bit better, right?

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
They do, and there are some advantages.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It means that you get to sleep in really late.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't have to wake up early.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And you have the day off, like the entire day to do something.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Exactly.

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What about you?

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Have you ever worked unusual hours?

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes, I used to work for a newspaper, and obviously people like their newspaper in the mornings.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Bright and early.

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Bright and early.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
We're talking about 6 a.m.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So obviously we would deliver the newspapers around 1 a.m., 2 a.m., from 1 a.m.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to about 6 a.m.

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So yeah, pretty unusual and very difficult because, for example, for some people, for them it's great to see the sunrise.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I've seen so many sunrises, and it's not really romantic for me anymore.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We would call you a night owl, someone who's more awake at night.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's right, and I still am.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So we were really interested to know maybe if you had any unusual working hours.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Or do you work a 9 to 5?

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, do you have a 9 to 5 job?

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So come to our website, EnglishPod.com, let us know, and we'll see everyone there.

235
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Bye.
