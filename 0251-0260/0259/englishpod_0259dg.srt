00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
EnglishPod.com Could you tell me a little about the organization?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
For example, how big is your office here?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You see.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And how about the working hours?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly 9 to 5.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You could be on call at any time but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, I'm used to that, Mr Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Good, as long as you understand that.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr Parsons?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yesterday, but no.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That sounds ideal.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thanks for watching!
