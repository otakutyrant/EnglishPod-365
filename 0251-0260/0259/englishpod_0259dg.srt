00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:07,419
EnglishPod.com Could you tell me a little about the organization?

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,259
For example, how big is your office here?

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:18,120
Well, in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,600
The news desk staff in Hong Kong has around 80 staff.

5
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:23,480
You see.

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,780
And how about the working hours?

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,620
Well, as you know, Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly 9 to 5.

8
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:37,719
You could be on call at any time but we do have to work very unsociable hours at times.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,380
Well, I'm used to that, Mr Parsons, so that's not really a shock for me.

10
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,719
Good, as long as you understand that.

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,520
And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr Parsons?

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,659
Yesterday, but no.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,759
We are hoping to start from the beginning of next month.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,979
That sounds ideal.

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,619
Thanks for watching!
