00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Kathryn, and today we have a very serious dialogue for you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are going to talk about a will and testament, the last will and testament of someone.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
All right.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So what is a will and testament?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, basically, this is a document that someone writes, usually with a lawyer, that explains what to do with the person's body and their possessions, their things, after they die.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Right.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So many people write these, and the family will then use it to discover who gets to receive certain objects and what to do with this person's body.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Right.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Exactly.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So that is a last will and testament.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We are going to take a look at an example of one, so you would see more or less in English how one is written.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now, obviously, they can be very long and very complex, so we've taken one that has some interesting words there that are a little bit more specific, a lot of legal terms there.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So why don't we listen to this dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back shortly.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I direct that the disposition of my remains be as follows.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Betty Thompson nor English pod survives me.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my heirs, as determined by the laws of the state of California relating to dissent and distribution.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I appoint Robert Porter to act as the executor of this will, to serve without bond.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Should Robert Porter be unable or unwilling to serve, then I appoint Jason Smalls to act as the executor of this will.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I herewith affix my signature to this will on this, the 23rd of May, 2010, in the presence of the following witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this will at my request and in my presence.

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
All right, we're back, so now we're going to take a look at five key words on language takeaway.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Language takeaway.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, the first word here in language takeaway comes from the very beginning of this monologue.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We're reading the last will and testament aloud.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I, Luke Thompson, residing in California, being of sound mind.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sound as an adjective.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What does this mean?

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's very interesting.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So he says, I am in sound mind, and sound is an adjective to describe I am in a good state of mind.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Right, so it means not having any problems or logical or unaffected.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Basically, I'm not crazy, right?

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Right, I'm not crazy, I don't have any problems.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We can say this about other things, too.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We can say he's of sound body.

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Right, that means that he is healthy.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
He has no problems with his body.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or I could say, Marco, that's a really good decision.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a sound decision.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So again, that's also a way of saying good or...

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It will work.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It will work.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's feasible.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a good decision.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So you can use this adjective with sound body, sound mind, or a sound decision.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Or sometimes, some people even say, I think in Ireland, they say, oh, he's a really sound guy.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, so he's a good guy.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's a good guy.

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Very interesting.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Learn something.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So sound body, sound mind, sound guy.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Moving on, he was talking about the will, and he says, I hereby revoke all previous wills and codicils.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The verb here is to revoke.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,000
To revoke.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is something that a lot of people hear in America when they drive their car too fast.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The police catch them, and the police revoke their driver's license.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And that basically means to take away, or to take, right?

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
To take away from.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So this man here, Luke Thompson, what he's saying is, I revoke all previous wills.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That means any other will that I wrote before, it's not good anymore.

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm throwing it away.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is the only one that will exist.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So you can use this word revoke with many aspects.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
For example, sometimes employees will get their benefits revoked by the company because maybe they don't have enough money anymore.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Or maybe they're bad employees.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Or maybe they were bad employees.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's too bad.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
All right.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So to revoke.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now moving on, he was talking about his estate.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So this is very interesting because he says, I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my spouse.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, estate, it sounds like a very fancy word.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It is a fancy word.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sometimes we use this word to mean someone's property, their house.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But in a will, this means everything the person owns, house, car, things, pets, stocks, investments.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The estate is essentially everything the person owns as a kind of one unit.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Exactly.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So anything that is yours or you may have bought, just consider the estate is a big bag, right?

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's your estate.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And inside this bag is everything that you own.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You might see advertisements, in fact, in America or in England for estate sales.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This means that when someone passes away, when they die, their family will sell their things.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And this is an estate sale.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can find beautiful, interesting things in estate sales.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Exactly.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Very interesting.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So that is a person's estate.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now remember, this is in the legal terms because you also have other things like real estate and as you mentioned, which would be a house, right?

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay.

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Now apart from his estate, he was telling everyone as to how they should take care of his body or what they should do with it.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And he said, well, I am to be cremated.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is important.

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
When a person dies, there are generally two options.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Their body can be buried in a casket in the ground.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That means they're put in the earth, but a lot of people choose to be cremated.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That means that their body will be burned and their ashes, that means the things that are left after they are burned, they will be taken somewhere else, like in a bowl or a pot.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And in this case, that's what the person wants.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He wants to be cremated.

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So that would be the verb to cremate.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And the noun would be a cremation.

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Cremation.

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And what is going to happen to all this stuff?

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Basically it's going to be given away to his wife, to English pod, and to his heirs.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Heirs.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This is our next word.

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What is an heir?

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now, if you notice the H is silent there.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So his heirs.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And those are basically his children.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
His daughters or his sons.

114
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
My heirs are the people who are related to me, who in this case will receive some of my things.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, is it only the children or also it could be maybe any other relatives?

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It could be any other relative.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You could say, I'm his heir, he's my great uncle.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It means we're related, but we're not necessarily father and daughter or grandfather and granddaughter.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
An heir is someone who is related to the family, it doesn't have to be a certain relationship.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And now it's interesting because from this word we can get inheritance.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Now we didn't find it in the dialogue, so it's very interesting because it comes, they're very similar in spelling, right?

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Inheritance and heir.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Right.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Good to remember.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Good to remember.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You switch the E and the I's, right?

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's right.

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So inheritance is a thing.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You can receive this.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So I received an inheritance from my great grandmother.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That means I received some money or some things.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That means you were that person's heir.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okay.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Or, you know, in his inheritance he received a large house, he was the heir to a great fortune.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Interesting.

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So again, inheritance wasn't in the dialogue, but I think it's worth mentioning.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And I think now we can move on to four very interesting items that we have for you on Fluency Builder.

141
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Okay, these first two are words that we normally read or hear in legal documents, and I want to place emphasis on the fact that we don't really say them in spoken English.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So remember that these are more formal terms.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The first one is hereby.

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hereby.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I hereby declare.

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Right.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That means now.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
With this word, with this spoken sentence, this will happen.

150
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think we've seen it like in movies sometimes, like, I hereby declare this country in the name of England.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I hereby declare you man and wife.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Exactly.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That means in this moment, this happens.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay.

156
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And a very similar word that we also saw in the dialogue is herewith.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So in the Will and Testament, we hear Luke Thompson who says, I herewith affix my signature.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That means with the action of signing my name, signing my signature, this will be completed.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I herewith, you have to have an action, not just a word.

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So I herewith.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I herewith attach my seal.

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Okay.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A seal is like a stamp.

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Very common in the old days when you had real letters.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But I herewith attach my seal and give my approval to this document.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So it has to be something physical.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So if maybe you're writing like this very classic letter and you say, I herewith include a lock of my hair.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ooh, how romantic.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Okay.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's kind of creepy.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But you're including or attaching physically, right?

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I guess the modern version of herewith would be attach.

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Good.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Herewith, hereby.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We've got another phrase here that you might hear more commonly.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
At the beginning of the will and testament, there's a phrase, as follows, okay?

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I direct that the disposition of my remains be as follows.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So with my body, do as follows.

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So basically this is a very common way of putting this in a sentence to indicate that you're going to start to list items.

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's right.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or give instructions.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So for example, to make a loaf of bread, do as follows.

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Number one, get some flour.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Number two, add some water.

190
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So this is a way for us to say, listen, I'm going to give you instructions or a list.

191
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Pay attention.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So please do as follows.

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please act as follows.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Very good.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And our last word that we have here, going back to herewith, he said, I herewith affix my signature.

197
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What does it mean when you affix?

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Affix is a word.

200
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And we have a number of other words for these days, so you rarely hear it.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It means to attach or to include.

202
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay.

203
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I herewith affix my signature would be attach my signature.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I provide my signature or I herewith affix my address or I herewith affix something.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay.

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Very good.

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Really interesting stuff.

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You'll obviously see this very commonly with legal documents such as these, even though it is like older English, it's still very commonly used, I guess because the law is so old.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's right.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Definitely.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And I think that it's worth listening to today's monologue one more time.

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Think about some of the words that we've just discussed and we'll be back in a moment.

214
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I hereby declare this instrument to be my last will and testament.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I hereby revoke all previous wills and codicils.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I direct that the disposition of my remains be as follows.

217
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm to be cremated and taken to the summit of Mount Everest where my ashes will forever remain at the ceiling of the earth.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my spouse, Betty Thompson, should she survive me for 60 days.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If my spouse, Betty Thompson, does not survive me, I give all the rest and residue of my estate to English Pod.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If neither Betty Thompson nor English Pod survives me, I give all the rest and residue of my estate to my heirs as determined by the laws of the state of California relating to descent and distribution.

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I appoint Robert Porter to act as the executor of this will, to serve without bond.

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Should Robert Porter be unable or unwilling to serve, then I appoint Jason Smalls to act as the executor of this will.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I herewith affix my signature to this will on this the 23rd of May, 2010, in the presence of the following witnesses, who witnessed and subscribed this will at my request and in my presence.

224
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
All right, we're back.

225
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So this is a very interesting topic.

226
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Now I wonder, within the will or within the estate, do you also acquire a person's debts?

227
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ah, that's a good question.

228
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I know in some countries you do, in some countries you don't.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know in some cases some heirs have found themselves in some legal problems because all of a sudden they inherited that person's debts and stuff like that.

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think that does happen, especially for people whose properties are mortgaged.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:26,000
For example, if your uncle has a house and he didn't pay for it with cash, he has a mortgage and he dies and you inherit this house, you also inherit the mortgage.

232
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
So sometimes inheritances are not always a good thing.

233
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think this happened more in the past.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
There are more protections and safeguards for people today.

235
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
But definitely, what is it like in Ecuador?

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Do people inherit debt?

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, I think most, well obviously most banks when they give out loans or a mortgage you are, they have somebody that will kind of co-sign on these things.

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And I imagine, I'm not really very sure, but I know that if you inherit in a state that has a mortgage, you are forced to pay it.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And if you can't, then they will make that other person who co-signed it responsible if he still exists.

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
In these legal systems, it's sometimes very strange because it seems like there would be a lot of gaps.

242
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's right.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And everyone wants to protect themselves.

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So we've got the bank that wants to protect itself.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It gives a loan.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It wants the money back.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And a person who wants to protect himself from maybe a relative who dies and has debt.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So I'm curious to know what our users have to say.

249
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What is the situation in your country?

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do most people have a will and testament?

251
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What happens with debt?

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Or what happens if somebody dies and they don't have a will and testament?

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's a good question too.

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't have an answer for that one.

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Alright, so let us know and we'll give you guys some information on that as well.

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
EnglishPod.com.

257
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We'll see everyone there.

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Bye everyone.

259
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Bye.
