00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,719
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,620
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:12,480
And I am Catherine, and today we have a fun, game-focused lesson for you.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,080
That's right.

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,460
Today we have an elementary lesson, and it's all about playing board games.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,140
Okay, and the game in today's lesson is a famous one.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,879
It's called Monopoly.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,679
Monopoly.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,320
I don't know if you have this in your countries.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,179
It's a game in which you try to earn money and sell property and buy property.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,299
That means hotels, houses, things like that.

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,420
And it's very, very famous.

13
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,359
We're going to learn more about this game today.

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,820
So let's take a listen to our dialogue for the first time.

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,159
I'm not cheating.

16
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,520
When you pass go, you collect $200.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,659
Everyone knows that.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,760
Well, you can't just take the money.

19
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,980
You have to ask the bank for money.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,159
And I'm the banker.

21
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:09,280
Banker?

22
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,239
Yes?

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
Can I have my $200, please?

24
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:13,819
Sure.

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:14,819
Here you are.

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,579
$200.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,019
Thank you.

28
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:17,900
Please come again.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,719
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

30
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,480
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:29,420
So we saw some very interesting words there.

32
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:36,379
The dialogue is two people playing, so why don't we take a look at some of those words used in language takeaway.

33
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,579
Language takeaway.

34
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:47,219
This first word we can hear when we play games, it's not a good thing to be, but it's very common.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,439
The word is cheater.

36
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,420
A cheater.

37
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:49,819
All right.

38
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,900
And that's a noun.

39
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,060
A person that is a cheater.

40
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:56,480
If somebody says, you are a cheater, what does that mean?

41
00:01:57,019 --> 00:02:00,780
This means the person is not honest at games.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,479
For example, Marco, you and I are playing a card game and you go to the bathroom and then I take the cards I want, I hide the cards I don't want.

43
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,819
That's called cheating.

44
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:12,419
Right.

45
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:12,840
Okay.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,180
The verb to cheat.

47
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,840
But here, a person who cheats is a cheater.

48
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,539
Okay.

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,740
You're a cheater.

50
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,560
He's a cheater.

51
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,120
All right.

52
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,680
And remember that you say cheater, right?

53
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:29,219
Because sometimes many people that are learning English would say you are a cheat, right?

54
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,520
Cheater here is the noun.

55
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,240
That means it's the name of the person who does this.

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,719
He is a cheater.

57
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:36,900
They are cheaters.

58
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,460
Okay.

59
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,259
And well, moving on, sometimes cheaters and people that steal things are sent to jail.

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,500
That's right.

61
00:02:45,620 --> 00:03:00,340
So maybe if you go to a casino and you cheat, you use a cell phone or you use some kind of a computer device to win money, this is called cheating and the casino will send you to jail.

62
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,319
All right.

63
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,240
So jail is the place where people go.

64
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,020
What's the difference between prison and jail?

65
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,219
Basically, they're the same thing.

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,180
Two words for the same thing.

67
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,659
People who break the law, people who do bad things go to jail, not just cheaters.

68
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,240
All right.

69
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,000
So now you have another word.

70
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,979
Maybe you've seen that show Prison Break.

71
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,139
And so jail is pretty much the same thing.

72
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,860
So the show could have been called Jail Break.

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,680
That's right.

74
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,379
But yeah.

75
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,000
All right.

76
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:33,960
So moving on, our third word is the person who's handling money says, well, you know what?

77
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,379
I'm the banker.

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,280
A banker.

79
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:37,300
Cheater.

80
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,020
Banker.

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,039
So you know already a banker is probably a person.

82
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,819
This is a job.

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,300
So a banker is a person who works at a bank.

84
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:46,780
Okay.

85
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:56,819
So but what about the person that helps you when you go to the bank, like that gives you the money and the bank teller?

86
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,740
It's not the same as a banker, right?

87
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,780
No.

88
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,599
Generally speaking, a person who gives you money and collects your money, this is a teller.

89
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,259
A bank teller.

90
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,120
A bank teller.

91
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:17,860
But a banker is someone who works in the bank to make big decisions, to invest money, to give loans.

92
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,100
So usually maybe managers or executives are bankers.

93
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:23,759
That's right.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,160
Okay.

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,740
And moving on to our last word here, we have a verb and that is to collect.

96
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:38,399
So in the conversation between these two people, Karen the woman says, when you pass go, you collect $200.

97
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:39,379
Okay.

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,040
So to collect means to get.

99
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,139
That's right.

100
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,060
To get or to take.

101
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:51,259
So at the end of every month, my landlord comes to my house to collect rent.

102
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,339
That means to take money from me for the house or the apartment.

103
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:55,860
Okay.

104
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:56,379
Good.

105
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,500
So now you have another way to say to get or to acquire.

106
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,199
That's right.

107
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:01,740
All right.

108
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:02,899
So very interesting.

109
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:11,639
Why don't we go back, listen to this dialogue again and we'll take a look at all of these words that we just saw and when we return, we'll take a look at some phrases.

110
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,220
And send you to jail.

111
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,699
I am not cheating.

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,060
When you pass go, you collect $200.

113
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,180
Everyone knows that.

114
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,300
Well, you can't just take the money.

115
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,500
You have to ask the bank for money.

116
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,699
And I'm the banker.

117
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,819
Banker?

118
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,759
Yes.

119
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,160
Can I have my $200 please?

120
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:40,379
Sure.

121
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,360
Here you are.

122
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,100
$200.

123
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,560
Thank you.

124
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,459
Please come again.

125
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,279
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,500
All right.

127
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:50,920
We're back.

128
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,420
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

129
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,639
Fluency Builder Marco, you're such a cheater.

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,060
Such a cheater.

131
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,319
I'm not a cheater.

132
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,379
But what do you mean when you say you are such a cheater?

133
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,980
So we know cheater, right?

134
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,300
That's right.

135
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,839
You could say this for many different things.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
You're such a liar.

137
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,720
You are such a...

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,180
Such a terrible person.

139
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,920
You're such a bad person.

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,639
Normally we say this when we want to criticize someone, when we want to say something mean or negative.

141
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,699
You're such a means you're really a bad person.

142
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,500
You're really a cheater.

143
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:37,120
So obviously because we are using a noun, we can't really use an adverb, right?

144
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:40,139
If you're saying an adjective like, I am very happy.

145
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,959
You can't say, you are very cheater.

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,699
No, no, no, you wouldn't say that.

147
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,939
You have to use a different sentence structure to give emphasis.

148
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,720
So in this case you could say cheater.

149
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:52,439
Right.

150
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:55,019
Okay, but that's not as strong, is it?

151
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,379
As such a cheater.

152
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,819
You are such a cheater.

153
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,980
That means, gosh, you're a really big cheater.

154
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,040
Right, exactly.

155
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,540
So this is the way that you would use that structure, such a, and then a noun that is describing this person, right?

156
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,839
You could also use it for positive statements like, you're such a good friend.

157
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,680
Very good.

158
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,300
So then you are using the adjective, you are such a good friend.

159
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,139
You're such a nice person.

160
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,480
Okay, excellent.

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,660
All right, so moving on, we saw another interesting phrase when he said, well, you know what?

162
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,860
You can't just take the money.

163
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,740
So what does he mean when he says, can't just?

164
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,980
Okay, we could say, you can't take the money.

165
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,300
This is basically a rule.

166
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,500
You can't take the money.

167
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:47,279
But you can't just take the money means there are other things you have to do before you take the money, okay?

168
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,259
You have to, in this case, ask the banker for the money.

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:59,639
Or for example, if I want to drive a car, I can't just go buy a car.

170
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,420
I need to first get a driver's license.

171
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,879
I need to learn how to drive.

172
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,339
I need to register.

173
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:13,120
So you can't just, just here means there's some things we need to do before this happens.

174
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,079
You can't just means you can't do these things that easily.

175
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:21,480
You have to do other things before it, as you said.

176
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,959
Okay, so very interesting.

177
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,980
We will try to use that one in a sentence.

178
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:30,199
But moving on to our last phrase, when the person said, you know what?

179
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,639
All right, you want your $200?

180
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,100
Here you are.

181
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,200
Here you are.

182
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,039
So sometimes people think that this phrase means you are here.

183
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:38,500
Right.

184
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,279
Which it could in some cases.

185
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,720
Oh, yeah, that's right.

186
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,779
So basically you're saying, I found you.

187
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,379
Here you are.

188
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:45,899
I found you.

189
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,159
But in this case, this doesn't make sense.

190
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:49,220
We're talking about money.

191
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,320
We're talking about a game.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,700
So if you think about this, here you are, you can imagine someone is giving someone else a thing, an object.

193
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,179
So in the case of the bank teller, remember, we're talking about getting money at a bank.

194
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:09,139
A bank teller might say, here you are, sir, here's your money, and then give you some money.

195
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,500
So this is something we say in English when we give something to someone else.

196
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:20,379
Because otherwise, I guess it's strange if you just give something to someone and you don't say anything, right?

197
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:21,320
You need to say something.

198
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,039
And if you say here, that's very rude.

199
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,580
So this is a polite way to say, please take this.

200
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,419
This is for you.

201
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,940
You might hear this at a restaurant.

202
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,139
Here you are.

203
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:33,799
Here's your food.

204
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:34,840
Here you are.

205
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,259
Okay.

206
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:37,659
It's a very useful phrase.

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,759
And so I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

208
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,059
And we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

209
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,820
Well, you can't just take the money.

210
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,000
You have to ask the bank for money.

211
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:09,279
And I'm the banker.

212
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:10,279
Banker?

213
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:11,240
Yes?

214
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,620
Can I have my $200, please?

215
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:14,840
Sure.

216
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,840
Here you are.

217
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,580
$200.

218
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,039
Thank you.

219
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:18,899
Please come again.

220
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,840
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

221
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:29,580
All right, we're back.

222
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,159
So a lot of interesting words there.

223
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,539
A lot of interesting phrases.

224
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
They're really interesting and very useful.

225
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,720
So remember to try and use such a, you can't just, or here you are when you're giving something to someone.

226
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,320
That's right.

227
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,139
These are really great.

228
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,620
And I recommend also playing some games.

229
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,620
Games are a great way to improve your language skills.

230
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:54,200
Monopoly, the game that they're playing in this dialogue, is a really fun one for numbers.

231
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,059
Because the whole point of the game, the whole purpose of the game, is to make the most money.

232
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:01,440
Right.

233
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,100
Of anyone playing.

234
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:11,559
And this is a really fun one because you get to buy houses and hotels and there's simple street names and place names.

235
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:12,159
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,399
Like Park Avenue or the Boardwalk.

237
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,759
So you'll learn a lot of really great things about American culture and English.

238
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,480
Yeah, it's a really good game.

239
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,220
Very popular.

240
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,740
I'm sure they have it in your language, but if you could get it in English, that would be really great.

241
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:32,120
And also another really good game to play with your friends to practice your vocab is Scrabble.

242
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,039
Scrabble.

243
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:33,799
That's hard.

244
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,679
Scrabble is a game about words.

245
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,220
And so basically you have to, you have to make words out of letters.

246
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:41,720
Yeah.

247
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,480
And whoever has the most interesting words, unique words, that person wins.

248
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:54,220
So obviously it's a great game to improve your vocab because you also learn some words that maybe you didn't know before and your friends knew.

249
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:59,519
So it's really fun to play, obviously don't play with any native English speakers because they might win.

250
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:04,360
So, but it's a really cool game to play if you have any friends who are also learning English.

251
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:14,159
You can get together, play Scrabble, and it's a fun way to improve your vocab and to also fight a little bit because all the time some people are trying to make up new words that don't really exist.

252
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:15,460
We call them cheaters.

253
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,159
Cheaters.

254
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,320
So yeah, let us know about your game experiences.

255
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,559
Do you like to play games?

256
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,840
Do you have a favorite game?

257
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,539
Practice some of these and let us know how they go.

258
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,100
All right.

259
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,960
We'll see you guys there.

260
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,100
EnglishPod.com.

261
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,700
Bye everyone.

262
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:27,919
Bye.
