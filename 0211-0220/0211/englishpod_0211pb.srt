00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And I am Catherine, and today we have a fun, game-focused lesson for you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today we have an elementary lesson, and it's all about playing board games.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, and the game in today's lesson is a famous one.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's called Monopoly.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Monopoly.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know if you have this in your countries.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a game in which you try to earn money and sell property and buy property.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That means hotels, houses, things like that.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And it's very, very famous.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to learn more about this game today.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's take a listen to our dialogue for the first time.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not cheating.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When you pass go, you collect $200.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Everyone knows that.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, you can't just take the money.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have to ask the bank for money.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And I'm the banker.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Banker?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can I have my $200, please?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sure.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here you are.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
$200.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Please come again.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
All right, we're back.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So we saw some very interesting words there.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The dialogue is two people playing, so why don't we take a look at some of those words used in language takeaway.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Language takeaway.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This first word we can hear when we play games, it's not a good thing to be, but it's very common.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The word is cheater.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A cheater.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All right.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And that's a noun.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A person that is a cheater.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If somebody says, you are a cheater, what does that mean?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This means the person is not honest at games.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
For example, Marco, you and I are playing a card game and you go to the bathroom and then I take the cards I want, I hide the cards I don't want.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's called cheating.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The verb to cheat.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But here, a person who cheats is a cheater.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're a cheater.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He's a cheater.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And remember that you say cheater, right?

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Because sometimes many people that are learning English would say you are a cheat, right?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Cheater here is the noun.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That means it's the name of the person who does this.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He is a cheater.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They are cheaters.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And well, moving on, sometimes cheaters and people that steal things are sent to jail.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's right.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So maybe if you go to a casino and you cheat, you use a cell phone or you use some kind of a computer device to win money, this is called cheating and the casino will send you to jail.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,000
All right.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So jail is the place where people go.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What's the difference between prison and jail?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Basically, they're the same thing.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Two words for the same thing.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
People who break the law, people who do bad things go to jail, not just cheaters.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,000
All right.

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So now you have another word.

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Maybe you've seen that show Prison Break.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And so jail is pretty much the same thing.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So the show could have been called Jail Break.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But yeah.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So moving on, our third word is the person who's handling money says, well, you know what?

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm the banker.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
A banker.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cheater.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Banker.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So you know already a banker is probably a person.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is a job.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So a banker is a person who works at a bank.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So but what about the person that helps you when you go to the bank, like that gives you the money and the bank teller?

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's not the same as a banker, right?

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Generally speaking, a person who gives you money and collects your money, this is a teller.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A bank teller.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
A bank teller.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But a banker is someone who works in the bank to make big decisions, to invest money, to give loans.

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So usually maybe managers or executives are bankers.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And moving on to our last word here, we have a verb and that is to collect.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So in the conversation between these two people, Karen the woman says, when you pass go, you collect $200.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay.

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So to collect means to get.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
To get or to take.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So at the end of every month, my landlord comes to my house to collect rent.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That means to take money from me for the house or the apartment.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So now you have another way to say to get or to acquire.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's right.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So very interesting.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why don't we go back, listen to this dialogue again and we'll take a look at all of these words that we just saw and when we return, we'll take a look at some phrases.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And send you to jail.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I am not cheating.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When you pass go, you collect $200.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Everyone knows that.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, you can't just take the money.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You have to ask the bank for money.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I'm the banker.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Banker?

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Can I have my $200 please?

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sure.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Here you are.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
$200.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please come again.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
All right.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We're back.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Fluency Builder Marco, you're such a cheater.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Such a cheater.

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not a cheater.

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But what do you mean when you say you are such a cheater?

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So we know cheater, right?

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's right.

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You could say this for many different things.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're such a liar.

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are such a...

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Such a terrible person.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're such a bad person.

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Normally we say this when we want to criticize someone, when we want to say something mean or negative.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're such a means you're really a bad person.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're really a cheater.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So obviously because we are using a noun, we can't really use an adverb, right?

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you're saying an adjective like, I am very happy.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can't say, you are very cheater.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, no, no, you wouldn't say that.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have to use a different sentence structure to give emphasis.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So in this case you could say cheater.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Right.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, but that's not as strong, is it?

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
As such a cheater.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You are such a cheater.

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That means, gosh, you're a really big cheater.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right, exactly.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So this is the way that you would use that structure, such a, and then a noun that is describing this person, right?

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You could also use it for positive statements like, you're such a good friend.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Very good.

158
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So then you are using the adjective, you are such a good friend.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're such a nice person.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, excellent.

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right, so moving on, we saw another interesting phrase when he said, well, you know what?

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can't just take the money.

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So what does he mean when he says, can't just?

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay, we could say, you can't take the money.

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is basically a rule.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can't take the money.

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But you can't just take the money means there are other things you have to do before you take the money, okay?

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You have to, in this case, ask the banker for the money.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Or for example, if I want to drive a car, I can't just go buy a car.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I need to first get a driver's license.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I need to learn how to drive.

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I need to register.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So you can't just, just here means there's some things we need to do before this happens.

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't just means you can't do these things that easily.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You have to do other things before it, as you said.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay, so very interesting.

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We will try to use that one in a sentence.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But moving on to our last phrase, when the person said, you know what?

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
All right, you want your $200?

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Here you are.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Here you are.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So sometimes people think that this phrase means you are here.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Right.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Which it could in some cases.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So basically you're saying, I found you.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Here you are.

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I found you.

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But in this case, this doesn't make sense.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We're talking about money.

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We're talking about a game.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So if you think about this, here you are, you can imagine someone is giving someone else a thing, an object.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So in the case of the bank teller, remember, we're talking about getting money at a bank.

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
A bank teller might say, here you are, sir, here's your money, and then give you some money.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So this is something we say in English when we give something to someone else.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because otherwise, I guess it's strange if you just give something to someone and you don't say anything, right?

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You need to say something.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And if you say here, that's very rude.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So this is a polite way to say, please take this.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is for you.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You might hear this at a restaurant.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Here you are.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Here's your food.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Here you are.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a very useful phrase.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And so I think it's time for us to listen to this dialogue again.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, you can't just take the money.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You have to ask the bank for money.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I'm the banker.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Banker?

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes?

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Can I have my $200, please?

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sure.

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Here you are.

217
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,000
$200.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you.

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Please come again.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now it's my turn to roll the dice.

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
All right, we're back.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So a lot of interesting words there.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A lot of interesting phrases.

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
They're really interesting and very useful.

225
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So remember to try and use such a, you can't just, or here you are when you're giving something to someone.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
These are really great.

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And I recommend also playing some games.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Games are a great way to improve your language skills.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Monopoly, the game that they're playing in this dialogue, is a really fun one for numbers.

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Because the whole point of the game, the whole purpose of the game, is to make the most money.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Right.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Of anyone playing.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And this is a really fun one because you get to buy houses and hotels and there's simple street names and place names.

235
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like Park Avenue or the Boardwalk.

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So you'll learn a lot of really great things about American culture and English.

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah, it's a really good game.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Very popular.

240
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sure they have it in your language, but if you could get it in English, that would be really great.

241
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And also another really good game to play with your friends to practice your vocab is Scrabble.

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Scrabble.

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's hard.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Scrabble is a game about words.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And so basically you have to, you have to make words out of letters.

246
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah.

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And whoever has the most interesting words, unique words, that person wins.

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So obviously it's a great game to improve your vocab because you also learn some words that maybe you didn't know before and your friends knew.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So it's really fun to play, obviously don't play with any native English speakers because they might win.

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So, but it's a really cool game to play if you have any friends who are also learning English.

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can get together, play Scrabble, and it's a fun way to improve your vocab and to also fight a little bit because all the time some people are trying to make up new words that don't really exist.

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
We call them cheaters.

253
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Cheaters.

254
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So yeah, let us know about your game experiences.

255
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you like to play games?

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you have a favorite game?

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Practice some of these and let us know how they go.

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
All right.

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We'll see you guys there.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
EnglishPod.com.

261
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Bye everyone.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Bye.
