00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My name is Catherine, and today we're talking about helping other people.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's right.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We are going to volunteer and to help other people that maybe don't have as much as we do, and so this is a way to give back to the community.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So this is an intermediate level lesson, and before we get going, we have a phrase to preview in today's vocabulary preview.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right, so in vocabulary preview today, we have this phrase, a soup kitchen, or it's a noun, a soup kitchen.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
A soup kitchen is a place.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Basically, it is a place where volunteers can help cook and serve people who don't have enough money to feed themselves.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay, so that's a soup kitchen.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's basically a place where people can get free food.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's right.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So this is where we're going to be today.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We are at a soup kitchen, and we're going to hear a couple of people talking about helping out at a soup kitchen.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's listen.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We really appreciate your help.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling to make ends meet.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Don't be silly, Mark.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm more than happy to donate my time to a good cause.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The people who come here have fallen on hard times, and a delicious hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Wow, that smells great.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thanks, Mark.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Here you go.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Enjoy your meal.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you, my dear.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, this looks lovely.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You're welcome.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hello, sir.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Today we have...

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,000
George!

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing here?

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey, Judy, I'll have a little of everything.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thanks.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Smells great.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You've got no right to be here.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're hardly homeless.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't be like that, Judy.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I really miss your home cooking.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
All right, we're back.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So obviously this person, what was he, George, he didn't really need the food, but apparently I think he's divorced from his wife, and he was like, I need your food.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But other people that were there were very much in need of this food, so why don't we take a look at some of the words and phrases on Language Takeaway.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, we've got a couple of interesting words here at the beginning that have to do with volunteering or helping other people.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The first phrase we have actually is to pitch in.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right, to pitch in.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So when you pitch in, that's a way of saying helping, right?

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's right, to help.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So I could ask you for your help with something.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I could say, hey, Marco, can you pitch in a little of your time with this project I have?

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay, so dedicate or to help, to pitch in.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So when you pitch in, you are helping.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is a really common phrase, very colloquial though, right?

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
To pitch in, that's right.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And then moving on, another adjective, when a person likes to help or gives money to the poor, that person is generous.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So generous is an adjective.

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That means a person can be generous or an effort can be generous.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For example, a very famous generous person is...

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, I was thinking Warren Buffett, but both of them are very generous.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Mother Teresa for giving back to the poor and Warren Buffett for donating most of his money.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, very good.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So that is a sign of a person that is generous.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So usually generous people like Warren Buffett, you say he gave away his fortune to people that didn't have money.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We call these people the less fortunate.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So as you said, we've got three words here that mean poor people, basically.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And we don't like to say poor people in English because it's not very nice.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You know, people can't control their situation in many cases and it's more of a situation of not having what others have.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And so one way to say this is less fortunate.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So a person that's less fortunate is a person that's poor.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So I could say, for example, we often try to help the less fortunate by volunteering our time.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So fortunate is a way of saying that you have fortune or you have luck.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So if you say you are very fortunate, that means that you are very lucky.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's right.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So less fortunate means poor.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And another way of saying that somebody is poor, you say that person is needy.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Needy.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So this probably makes you think of the word need to need.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And you're right.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This comes from need.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So someone who is needy needs things, needs money, needs help, needs food.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Even attention, right?

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Somebody that's needy might need a lot of attention all the time.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So this could actually be a bad thing.

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Someone who's needy says, look at me, look at me, oh my gosh, look at me, listen to me.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And that can be very annoying.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So the needy.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And now finally, a very common word to say that somebody is very poor, doesn't have a place to live, doesn't have a home, you say that person is homeless.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Homeless literally means without a home.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And so we often talk about the homeless as being a group of people we want to help in society because the homeless live on the streets.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They live in public and in the winter and times when it's really, really cold, it's very dangerous for them.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So the homeless are a group that people try to help with these soup kitchens and shelters.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Okay.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Very good.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So a lot of interesting words, common phrases, they're very useful.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So why don't we go back, listen to this dialogue again and we'll be back in a little bit with Fluency Builder.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We really appreciate your help.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling to make ends meet.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't be silly, Mark.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm more than happy to donate my time to a good cause.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The people who come here have fallen on hard times and a delicious hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Wow, that smells great.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thanks, Mark.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Here you go.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Enjoy your meal.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you, my dear.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, this looks lovely.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're welcome.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hello, sir.

136
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Today we have George.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey, Judy, I'll have a little of everything, thanks.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Mmm, smells great.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You've got no right to be here.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're hardly homeless.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't be like that, Judy.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I really miss your home cooking.

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Alright, we're back.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, on Fluency Builder today we have three key phrases.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So, we're going to take a look at those now.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Fluency Builder.

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Okay, so what is our first phrase?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Our first phrase comes from the beginning of the dialogue with Mark who says, you know, there are some people who are struggling to make ends meet.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So, the phrase here is to make ends meet.

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, to make ends meet.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, I have...

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
So, if you take a look at this phrase, it's very hard to determine what that actually means.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What does it mean?

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, think about a string.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you want to make a circle out of that string, you have to connect the ends, right?

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And I think of that as being about your income and the money that you spend.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I cannot make ends meet if I earn $10 every week but I spend $15 on my house and my food.

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, so not being able to make ends meet means you spend more than you earn.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And that's not about cars and fancy TVs.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's about your house, your heat, your bills, your food.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I say, I've been able to make ends meet for a while now because I have a pretty good job.

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, so to make ends meet is to be able to pay for your necessities.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But he can't make ends meet means he can't support himself financially.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okay, very good.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, to make ends meet is pretty much to satisfy your basic necessities.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Financially.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Financially.

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, very good.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And moving on, when we were talking about generosity and people helping out, you know, if you help people that are less fortunate, you are making a difference in a small way.

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay, so this is a phrase that we hear all the time in the States.

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm not sure if it's the same in other English-speaking countries but it's a very popular phrase.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We talk about making a difference or trying to make a difference.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And it's not very clear what a difference really is.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But generally this means doing good things for other people.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Okay, so celebrities try to make a difference with their money and their fame.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Some people try to make a difference by working at homeless shelters or at soup kitchens.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And so there are many different ways to make a difference, but it's basically the idea that you volunteer or you give money to help other people.

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Okay, very good.

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So even if, for example, you recycle, you can say you're making a difference in the environment.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right, you're making a difference.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Usually a difference is a positive thing, so keep that in mind.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Very good.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And for the last phrase on Fluency Builder today, we say that people who come here have fallen on hard times.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So people that have fallen on hard times.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What does it mean if you fall on hard times?

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, basically hard times are difficulties, right?

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So not being able to make ends meet, not being able to pay for your food and your housing.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And so we have the verb to fall.

193
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You've fallen on hard times because you've gone from a place where you're comfortable to a lower place, a place where life is really hard.

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And so think of this as a fixed phrase.

195
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He fell on hard times or they fell on hard times.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This means they don't have much money or they can't support themselves or they went bankrupt, for example.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So somebody that loses their job may have fallen on hard times.

198
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And there's one more phrase here that deserves a little attention.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We heard this word to bolster.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
To bolster is a verb that means to improve.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So a hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That means it can make them feel better.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So to bolster their spirits means to make them feel happier, to lift their spirits.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Exactly what you said, to make them feel happier.

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, awesome.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So a lot of interesting phrases there.

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ways that you can talk in English about making a difference, about volunteering.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Very interesting stuff.

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Very good for conversations between friends and family.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't be silly, Mark.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm more than happy to donate my time to a good cause.

216
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

217
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

219
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The people who come here have fallen on hard times and a delicious hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

221
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Wow, that smells great.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thanks, Mark.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Here you go.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Enjoy your meal.

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Thank you, my dear.

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh, this looks lovely.

228
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're welcome.

229
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hello, sir.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Today we have George.

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What are you doing here?

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey, Judy, I'll have a little of everything, thanks.

233
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mmm, smells great.

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You've got no right to be here.

237
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You're hardly homeless.

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't be like that, Judy.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I really miss your home cooking.

240
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All right, we're back.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So talking about volunteering, have you ever done any volunteer work?

242
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I have.

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've done quite a bit, actually.

244
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah, what have you done?

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Back when I was living in the United States in Chicago, I used to cook for a homeless shelter every week, so I would bring food every Thursday.

246
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So you cook at home and you bring the food over to the shelter.

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's right.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So the shelter had a kitchen, but they used donations from people because there were so many people who came there for food.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And once a month I would volunteer to also serve the food.

250
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So I would bring lasagna or pasta, things that most people like, and then once a month I would sit down with people and talk.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You know, a lot of people are lonely when they're in homeless shelters because they come alone or maybe it's their mother and her child.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's nice to also come and sit and talk to them.

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No, it's very interesting, and I think volunteering is a much better solution than, for example, just giving out money to poor people or something like that.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't think that's really the solution.

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I think you should dedicate your time and your energy to making a difference, like in the dialogue.

257
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, and I think that the other benefit is for you, the volunteer, because it changes your perspective on poverty and on humanity, and you think about, well, you know, I could be this person.

258
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He was a banker two years ago, and now he doesn't have a house.

259
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And so I think it has a positive effect on everybody involved.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, for sure.

261
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No, I think it's a very rewarding experience, and I think EnglishPod definitely supports that you should volunteer, you should make a difference, and I think we can all help each other, right?

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's right.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And let us know, have you ever volunteered?

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What kind of volunteer work have you done?

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Has it been environmental or social?

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We hope to see you there.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,000
All right.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Bye, everyone.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Bye.
