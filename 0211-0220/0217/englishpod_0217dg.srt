00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,699
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,320
We really appreciate your help.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,580
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling to make ends meet.

4
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:20,120
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

5
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,460
Don't be silly, Mark.

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:24,199
I'm more than happy to donate my time to a good cause.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:27,760
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

8
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:31,620
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,039
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,619
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:44,740
The people who come here have fallen on hard times, and a delicious hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

12
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:48,939
Wow, that smells great.

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,420
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:52,780
Thanks, Mark.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,439
Here you go.

16
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,439
Enjoy your meal.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,479
Thank you, my dear.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,240
Oh, this looks lovely.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,780
You're welcome.

20
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:06,719
Hello, sir.

21
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,939
Today, we have George.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,540
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:12,099
Hey, Judy.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,760
I'll have a little of everything.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,319
Thanks.

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,379
Smells great.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,480
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,920
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,819
You've got no right to be here.

30
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,040
You're hardly homeless.

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,900
Don't be like that, Judy.

32
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,719
I really miss your home cooking.
