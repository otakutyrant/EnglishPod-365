00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thanks a lot for pitching in once again, Judy.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We really appreciate your help.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It seems that at this time of year, there are more and more people who are struggling to make ends meet.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
There aren't many professional chefs like you who are so generous with their time.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't be silly, Mark.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm more than happy to donate my time to a good cause.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Volunteering at the soup kitchen has been really rewarding for me.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You know, it's satisfying to provide good meals for those who are less fortunate.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I feel like I'm really making a difference in some small way.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, your skills are definitely appreciated here.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The people who come here have fallen on hard times, and a delicious hot meal can really bolster their spirits.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wow, that smells great.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The needy are sure lucky to have you.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thanks, Mark.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here you go.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Enjoy your meal.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you, my dear.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, this looks lovely.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're welcome.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hello, sir.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today, we have George.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey, Judy.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll have a little of everything.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thanks.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Smells great.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
George, seriously, what are you doing here?

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I haven't seen you since our divorce was finalized.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You've got no right to be here.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You're hardly homeless.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't be like that, Judy.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I really miss your home cooking.
