EnglishPod.com Hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Thank you, I'm doing much better.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
How's that going?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There are many things that you have to arrange.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, Wendy is being cremated.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I see.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're doing a great job.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thanks.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.
