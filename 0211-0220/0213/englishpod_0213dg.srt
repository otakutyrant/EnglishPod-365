EnglishPod.com Hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

2
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,880
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,759
Thank you, I'm doing much better.

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,620
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,100
How's that going?

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,260
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,699
There are many things that you have to arrange.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,559
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do.

9
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,859
Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,799
No, Wendy is being cremated.

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,799
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,259
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,579
I see.

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,079
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

16
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:47,880
You're doing a great job.

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,159
Thanks.

18
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:57,039
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.
