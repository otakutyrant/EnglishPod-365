00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Catherine, and today we have a sad lesson for you.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is an intermediate level lesson about what happens when a friend or family member dies.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, we have a lot of words that are related to all the preparations for when somebody dies, and also some phrases that you can say to someone that maybe had a family member who recently passed away.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So before we get into all of this, we have a keyword that we want to take a look at now in Vocabulary Preview.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All right, so in Vocabulary Preview, we have that one word, and it's the title of our lesson also, funeral.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Funeral.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So funeral is an event.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's something that we have.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So basically, a funeral is the time when we mourn someone who has died.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a celebration of their life.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So it's kind of like a ceremony where you respect that person that passed away, right?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Some people will talk about the person that passed away, or maybe, you know, it's time to maybe honor that person to, as you say, mourn and remember that person.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Right.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So it's very common for people in different religions to have different traditions.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In some religions, like I think in Christianity, you have a priest who will say some things that are very traditional and then say some things about the person who died, and other religions have different ceremonies.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So today we're going to take a look at what happens in preparing a funeral.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi, Daniel, how are you holding up?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Thank you.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm doing much better.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
How's that going?

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There are many things that you have to arrange.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, Wendy is being cremated.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I see.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're doing a great job.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Thanks.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright, we're back.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So a pretty interesting dialogue and I'm sure you have a lot of questions regarding some of those words and phrases that you heard.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So why don't we take a look at five key words on language takeaway?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Language takeaway.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So basically we have two friends in this dialogue who are discussing arrangements for a funeral and one friend is asking the other about his preparations and asks if he's bought a burial plot.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, burial plot.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Now what is a burial plot and why would you buy one?

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, a plot, P-L-O-T, plot is a piece of land.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So you can think about this logically, a burial plot, burial to bury is a place, a space in the ground where we bury a person.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Usually you buy one of these at a cemetery, right?

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So cemeteries have some, usually a lot of land and you can pay for a piece of land.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
A small portion.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,000
A small portion, yeah.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And that's a burial plot.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Okay, good.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And well, our next word is related to what you put into this burial plot, right?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Somebody dies and what goes into this piece of land is a casket.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's right.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I don't know if any of you are fans of the TV show Six Feet Under, but you'll know from this TV show that there are many different kinds of caskets.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So a casket is a box.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can have fancy caskets or you can have wooden caskets that are very simple like pine.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And basically this is the box that the person's body will go into when they're buried.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Very good.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So that is called a casket.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Well moving on, a new trend I would say in many countries and many people around the world don't want to be buried.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So what happens?

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You get cremated.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Cremated.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So this is the option for people who are not buried.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In some countries, China for example, I don't think you can be buried.

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You have to be cremated because there's an issue of space.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And this is an option for most people where basically your friend or your loved one, their body is burned and you can collect the remains afterwards.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,000
They're very small.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
They're ashes.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So it's like a burning process.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Interesting.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So the word is to be cremated, to get cremated.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
His body was cremated.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And well as you said, you take the ashes and you can put them in a cremation urn or just an urn.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, urn.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This might sound like a strange word to you.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But an urn is a special kind of pot, okay, or a vessel to hold things in.

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So for example, in this case we have a cremation urn that is a special pot, usually very beautiful.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sometimes there's a name on it.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
With the deceased person's ashes, his or her remains.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, very good.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So as you said, it's kind of like a vase or a pot, something very nice and small where you have the person's ashes.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right, so now we know what happened during the funeral.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We know what happens, how you maybe cremate the person or you put them in a casket.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And well, what happens afterwards?

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, afterwards you have a memorial service.

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So many people want to know what's the difference between a funeral and a memorial service.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:21,000
In my mind, a funeral is very quiet and sad and you have some respectful words and you usually put the casket into the ground or have some kind of ceremony.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But a memorial service is an opportunity to talk to friends and family, to eat some food, to have some drinks, to talk about the person who died.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's almost like the party, if that makes sense.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, exactly.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a get together of people who obviously are trying to give support to their friends or their family members who lost that person, but also to talk about that person in a good way and all the great memories they had.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I guess that's why it's called a memorial service because you remember and you give out your memories about that person.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, great.

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So a lot of interesting words there.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Very specific to this topic, but obviously really important.

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
So why don't we go back and listen to the dialogue again.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you, I'm doing much better.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
How's that going?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There are many things that you have to arrange.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No, Wendy is being cremated.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I see.

116
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're doing a great job.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thanks.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Alright, we're back.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
So we have a couple of phrases, four to be exact, that we want to take a look at now in Fluency Builder.

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Fluency Builder Okay, this first phrase is a very useful one if you're trying to ask someone about maybe how they're feeling or someone who's had some problems recently, you can ask them how things are going.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
One person says to the other, hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right, how are you holding up?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Now, you know that to hold up something means to have it in your hands, but in this case you're talking about how are things going?

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Right, but I wouldn't say, hey, how are you holding up?

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right, you wouldn't say that to somebody, right, in normal circumstances.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If Marco looks really happy, I won't ask him.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But if someone has passed through a very difficult period, for example, if someone dies in their family or perhaps if they've been very sick or there's some negative or difficult things that happen, you can say, how are you holding up?

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So it basically means how are you dealing with this difficult situation or how are you dealing with your illness?

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
How are you holding up?

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Or how are you holding up with your in-laws?

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Right, exactly, how are you dealing with that difficult situation?

135
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And then the person complemented this by saying, and this is a very good phrase, this whole sentence is very useful if you want to say something nice to a person that has recently lost someone, you say, I am greatly sorry for your loss.

136
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay, so you might have heard the word loss before, lose, loss.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Loss is a noun, it's a thing.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We normally say this about people who have died because you don't want to say, I'm really sorry for your dead brother.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You know, it's sad, it's very rude, too direct.

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
So in English, we say, I'm greatly sorry for your loss, for this part of your life that has gone away.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Right.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You can also say, I'm very sorry for your loss.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is a standard phrase for funerals and memorial services.

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Exactly, so if somebody's brother died, you go up to that person and you can say, I am greatly sorry for your loss, I am very sorry for your loss.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what you say, and it's very respectful and it's very nice to say.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes, it's very nice.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:44,000
All right, so now moving on, we've said that the person is sorry and everything, but then they were talking about the girl Wendy and that she had life insurance, and that she also left behind a detailed will.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Does that mean she forgot it?

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
She forgot it, but that can mean that, right?

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Right, no, yeah, this is a phrase that has a couple different meanings.

151
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And so it's important to look at this one when we're talking about someone who has died, who left behind something.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It means that they have completed it in this case, or it survives them.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, so they left that for you, okay?

154
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Because as you said, it has a couple of different meanings, like to leave behind can be to lose or to forget, but in this case, specifically, it's to leave for you.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, for example, you could say he died and he left behind three children, okay?

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So that means that he had three children when he died and they're still alive.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Right, okay, very interesting phrase, to leave something behind.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so she left behind a detailed will, and that's going to sort out any other legal matters.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
To sort out, this is a great verb, this is a, well, it's a verbal phrase that we hear a lot with documents and wills and things like this.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Basically, to sort out means to solve problems or to fix or to amend.

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
For example, have you sorted out that problem you had with your plane tickets?

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay, yeah, to sort out.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So have you fixed those problems or have you solved those problems that you had with your plane tickets?

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
To sort out, to fix, to make arrangements for, very, very useful phrase.

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Very useful phrase, okay.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So four key phrases there, really good ones.

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue, and we'll be back to talk a little bit more.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hi Daniel, how are you holding up?

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm greatly sorry for your loss.

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you, I'm doing much better.

171
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've begun organizing everything for the funeral.

172
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
How's that going?

173
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a lot harder than I imagined.

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There are many things that you have to arrange.

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I booked a time and date with the funeral home, but I still have a lot of things to do.

176
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Have you bought a burial plot and a casket?

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, Wendy is being cremated.

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She always talked about how she didn't want to be buried.

179
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I see.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That sounds like something she would have really liked.

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm sure the memorial service will be tasteful.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're doing a great job.

184
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thanks.

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It hasn't been easy, but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters.

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Alright, we're back.

187
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So now, talking about funerals, there's an interesting word.

188
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What is it called when a person speaks at a funeral?

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Well, normally at a funeral, a loved one or friend will give a eulogy.

190
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Eulogy?

191
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Eulogy.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Okay, that's e-u, right?

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
E-u.

194
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It looks like a funny word, but it's very important and it's something that you hear a lot, who will give the eulogy or his son will give the eulogy.

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So this is maybe the keynote address in a funeral.

196
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This is the important speech where someone will discuss the person who has died and his or her contributions and life.

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Right.

198
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay, so that's called a eulogy.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's really interesting because, I don't know, it's kind of a word that you don't really use much and you wouldn't really know it.

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
For example, I didn't really know about it until I saw it in a movie when he made a mistake.

201
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He said googlygee or something like that.

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, really?

203
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It was in a comedy.

204
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But very interesting words.

205
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a sad topic, but it happens sometimes.

206
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You have to deal with these things and so if you have to do it in English, well what better way than to learn all of these things, which could come in handy sometimes.

207
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right.

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
And you never know, you're watching a movie or something and this comes up.

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There are a lot of comedies, like you said.

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
We call them black comedies.

211
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It means they're very dark and strange.

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And they like Four Weddings and a Funeral is a very famous English movie about this kind of thing.

213
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And so this is useful vocabulary and some useful phrases for those situations as well.

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Exactly.

215
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Even if you maybe meet somebody who, I remember I knew somebody who met a casket salesman.

216
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Really?

217
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Called caskets.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
An interesting job.

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, so you never know.

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You never know.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, I hope you've enjoyed this lesson.
