00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:10,580
EnglishPod.com Okay, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:13,640
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,320
Remember?

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,140
Our new healthy lifestyle?

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,640
That's all junk food.

6
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:18,539
Huh.

7
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,980
Right, so what did you get?

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,899
Well, healthy food, of course.

9
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:28,000
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,579
Organic?

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,739
What's organic?

12
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,719
Do we need organic carrots?

13
00:00:32,179 --> 00:00:35,280
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,100
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

15
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:42,340
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

16
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,240
Yep, better for the environment and better for us.

17
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,600
Wait a minute.

18
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:47,920
What's that?

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,219
Donuts?

20
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,740
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

21
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,179
But I like donuts.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,539
Thanks for watching!
