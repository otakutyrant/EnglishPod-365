00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Okay, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Remember?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Our new healthy lifestyle?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's all junk food.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Huh.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Right, so what did you get?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, healthy food, of course.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Organic?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's organic?

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Do we need organic carrots?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yep, better for the environment and better for us.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Wait a minute.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's that?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Donuts?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But I like donuts.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Thanks for watching!
