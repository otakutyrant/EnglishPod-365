00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And today we have a very healthy lesson for everyone.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We are going to have healthy food.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So we're going to the grocery store and we're choosing what food to buy.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You're going to hear a lot of words about eating right and eating healthy.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So let's jump into this dialogue first, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
OK, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs and lots of cheese.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Remember our new healthy lifestyle?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's all junk food.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Huh.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So what did you get?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, healthy food, of course.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish and organic carrots.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Organic?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What's organic?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do we need organic carrots?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yep.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Better for the environment and better for us.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What's that?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Donuts?

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But I like donuts.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So it's a very popular topic nowadays.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
People want to eat light.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So why don't we take a look at some of these words and phrases now in Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The first kind of food we have here is whole wheat bread.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So maybe you're buying bread at the grocery store and you see a number of different kinds of bread.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There's white bread.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
There's rye bread.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, we have whole wheat bread, which is maybe the healthiest option.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So it's made out of wheat.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So we have whole wheat bread.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now, as you say, it's a type of bread that uses wheat as its main ingredient.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So it's made from wheat flour.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's usually a brownish kind of bread.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That means the color is brown, not white.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And it's healthier than white bread because white bread uses that processed flour, right?

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It does.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's processed and also uses a lot more sugar.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OK.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So whole wheat bread is a healthy option.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And also, we are having skimmed milk.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So as you know, when milk comes out of the cow, it's very, very fatty.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's lots of fat.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And so skimmed milk means that when the dairy is processing the milk, the fat is taken away.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So this is one of the healthier kinds of milk.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You have fat-free and skimmed milk, which are the healthiest.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So when you buy normal milk, what is that called?

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, you have whole milk.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Whole milk.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You also have 2% milk, which is 2% fat.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And then skimmed milk and fat-free milk.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,000
OK, good.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, when we were talking about the carrots, she said, you know what?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We also bought organic carrots.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So this is a very popular word nowadays, organic vegetables, organic carrots.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What does it mean if it's organic?

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, in general, things that are organic come from nature.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But in food, things that are organic don't use chemicals.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So a lot of people are very nervous about food that comes from farms that have pesticides or chemicals on them.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But organic food is safe in this area.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There's no pesticides or chemicals.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So what about when you talk about chickens or animals, they also say it's an organic farm.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That means that they don't have chemicals injected into them.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They're not stuffed with chemicals or given chemical shots.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And also, the food that they eat is real food.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not like chemical food to make them fatter.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
OK, very good.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So organic foods.

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And you mentioned the word chemicals a lot.

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So when we talk about chemicals, we're talking about substances that are artificial, right?

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They're not organic.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
These are things that are chemicals that scientists come up with to help make food, for example, help make fatter chickens or to make greener vegetables.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And these are not natural.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
These are man-made.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And chemicals can also mean pesticides.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So some sprays or things that we put on plants to keep the bugs away.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And these are all things that have been found to hurt human beings.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, I guess, for example, when you are eating something and you see in the box and it says it has certain preservatives, those are chemicals, right, that help keep the food fresh for a longer period of time.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,000
OK.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So chemicals.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And that's the last word that we have for you in Language Takeaway.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Four key words here.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
OK, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right, remember, our new healthy lifestyle?

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's all junk food.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Huh.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Right.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So what did you get?

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, healthy food, of course.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Organic?

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What's organic?

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do we need organic carrots?

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yep.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Better for the environment and better for us.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait a minute.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's that?

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Donuts?

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I like donuts.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
All right, we're back.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This first key phrase is one that I think was very, very common in America in the late 80s, early 1990s.

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
People in America have been struggling with eating healthy food and not eating so much fatty food.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And so there was an emphasis on eating right.

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That's right.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
To eat right.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now, how do you eat right?

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I mean, it sounds like you want to eat with your spoon correctly.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, eating right is more about the kind of food you eat.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's about not eating pizza every day, pizza and hamburgers.

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So we say eating right involves having a balanced diet.

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That means eating vegetables and grains and a little bit of meat and not so many sweets or oils.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So that's what it means when you are eating right.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
So you have to eat right, that means eating healthy.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Now the opposite, if you're not eating healthy, that's because maybe you're eating too much junk food.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And that's our next phrase.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So junk food is, you know, junk garbage food.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's the kind of food that is very unhealthy for you.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Potato chips, pizza, ice cream.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's all the best kind of food, but it's also the worst for your body.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So we call it junk food.

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So everything that's, for example, fast food is usually considered to be junk food.

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, it's high in oils and fats.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So junk food.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And for the last phrase for today, what is it?

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Healthy lifestyle.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, healthy lifestyle.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And for the last phrase, we are starting a healthy lifestyle.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So what does he mean by a healthy lifestyle?

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, we don't say life, we say lifestyle because this is the way in which a person lives.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's your lifestyle.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So this involves exercise, diet, what kind of food you eat, the way that you work, do you get too much sleep, not enough sleep.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So your lifestyle is about the choices you make in all parts of your life.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And so having a healthy lifestyle, as I said, it's not just about not eating junk food.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's about running five miles or trying to get eight hours of sleep.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And usually in the news, we hear this phrase, not healthy life, but healthy lifestyle.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So maybe somebody that leads a dangerous lifestyle maybe has a job that's very dangerous.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Or an unhealthy lifestyle, someone who eats one meal a day.

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Very good.

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So those are key phrases for Fluency Builder.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Okay, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right, remember, our new healthy lifestyle.

172
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's all junk food.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Huh.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So what did you get?

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well, healthy food, of course.

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Organic?

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's organic?

180
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do we need organic carrots?

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yep.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Better for the environment and better for us.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Wait a minute.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What's that?

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Donuts?

189
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But I like donuts.

191
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All right, we're back.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So talking about healthy food and healthy eating, how healthy do you eat, Catherine?

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think I eat pretty decently.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I try to eat a balanced diet.

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like I said earlier, I think a balanced diet is a key to a healthy lifestyle.

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't really eat fast food.

197
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, really?

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I try not to eat too much meat or too much sugar.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What about organic stuff?

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Are you a big fan of organic vegetables, organic meats?

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I am.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And this comes from a part of the dialogue we didn't cover.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
One of the characters says that vegetables are the green option.

205
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So trying to eat organic food and think about green is a part of thinking about the environment.

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And so I think eating organic vegetables is an important part of caring about the environment because the more chemicals, the more pesticides we put into the world, the more harmful it is for the earth, for animals, and for ourselves.

207
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah, that's absolutely true.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And it has become a more popular aspect around America and Europe, people choosing to go with organic vegetables, for example, eggs that were grown on an organic farm.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And so it is the healthier option and obviously the green option as we saw in the dialogue.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay, so a very interesting topic.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We want to know what your opinion is on it.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:19,000

Maybe you love junk food.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Maybe.

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
