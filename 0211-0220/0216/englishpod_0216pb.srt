00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,639
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,379
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:07,639
My name is Catherine.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,480
And today we have a very healthy lesson for everyone.

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,460
We are going to have healthy food.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,699
So we're going to the grocery store and we're choosing what food to buy.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,039
You're going to hear a lot of words about eating right and eating healthy.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,280
So let's jump into this dialogue first, and we'll be back in a moment to talk more about it.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,200
OK, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs and lots of cheese.

10
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,240
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,759
Remember our new healthy lifestyle?

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:45,299
That's all junk food.

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:46,240
Huh.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,600
Right.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,619
So what did you get?

16
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,539
Well, healthy food, of course.

17
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,600
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish and organic carrots.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,179
Organic?

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,359
What's organic?

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,320
Do we need organic carrots?

21
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,880
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,700
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,959
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,599
Yep.

25
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:12,840
Better for the environment and better for us.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,200
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:15,540
What's that?

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:16,819
Donuts?

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,340
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

30
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,799
But I like donuts.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,239
So it's a very popular topic nowadays.

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,900
People want to eat light.

33
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,280
So why don't we take a look at some of these words and phrases now in Language Takeaway.

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
Language Takeaway.

35
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,140
The first kind of food we have here is whole wheat bread.

36
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,040
So maybe you're buying bread at the grocery store and you see a number of different kinds of bread.

37
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,359
There's white bread.

38
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,480
There's rye bread.

39
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,560
Well, we have whole wheat bread, which is maybe the healthiest option.

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,280
So it's made out of wheat.

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,340
All right.

42
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,859
So we have whole wheat bread.

43
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:03,340
Now, as you say, it's a type of bread that uses wheat as its main ingredient.

44
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,879
So it's made from wheat flour.

45
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,120
It's usually a brownish kind of bread.

46
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,479
That means the color is brown, not white.

47
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,280
And it's healthier than white bread because white bread uses that processed flour, right?

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,520
It does.

49
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,860
It's processed and also uses a lot more sugar.

50
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,000
OK.

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,300
So whole wheat bread is a healthy option.

52
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,159
And also, we are having skimmed milk.

53
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:26,280
All right.

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,919
So as you know, when milk comes out of the cow, it's very, very fatty.

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,259
There's lots of fat.

56
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,719
And so skimmed milk means that when the dairy is processing the milk, the fat is taken away.

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,219
So this is one of the healthier kinds of milk.

58
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,000
You have fat-free and skimmed milk, which are the healthiest.

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,939
So when you buy normal milk, what is that called?

60
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,840
Well, you have whole milk.

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,379
Whole milk.

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,879
You also have 2% milk, which is 2% fat.

63
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,580
And then skimmed milk and fat-free milk.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,680
OK, good.

65
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,879
Now, when we were talking about the carrots, she said, you know what?

66
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,159
We also bought organic carrots.

67
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,539
So this is a very popular word nowadays, organic vegetables, organic carrots.

68
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,300
What does it mean if it's organic?

69
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,800
Well, in general, things that are organic come from nature.

70
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,379
But in food, things that are organic don't use chemicals.

71
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,099
So a lot of people are very nervous about food that comes from farms that have pesticides or chemicals on them.

72
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,280
But organic food is safe in this area.

73
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,300
There's no pesticides or chemicals.

74
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,819
So what about when you talk about chickens or animals, they also say it's an organic farm.

75
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,180
That means that they don't have chemicals injected into them.

76
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,020
That's right.

77
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,039
They're not stuffed with chemicals or given chemical shots.

78
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,599
And also, the food that they eat is real food.

79
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,159
It's not like chemical food to make them fatter.

80
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:51,639
OK, very good.

81
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:53,780
So organic foods.

82
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,159
And you mentioned the word chemicals a lot.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,379
So when we talk about chemicals, we're talking about substances that are artificial, right?

84
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,180
That's right.

85
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,900
They're not organic.

86
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:14,900
These are things that are chemicals that scientists come up with to help make food, for example, help make fatter chickens or to make greener vegetables.

87
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,899
And these are not natural.

88
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,040
These are man-made.

89
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,860
And chemicals can also mean pesticides.

90
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,259
So some sprays or things that we put on plants to keep the bugs away.

91
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,100
And these are all things that have been found to hurt human beings.

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:43,819
Yeah, I guess, for example, when you are eating something and you see in the box and it says it has certain preservatives, those are chemicals, right, that help keep the food fresh for a longer period of time.

93
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,240
That's right.

94
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:44,980
OK.

95
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,060
So chemicals.

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,759
And that's the last word that we have for you in Language Takeaway.

97
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,319
Four key words here.

98
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,779
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again, and we'll be back in a bit.

99
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,720
OK, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,259
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right, remember, our new healthy lifestyle?

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
That's all junk food.

102
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:12,699
Huh.

103
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,139
Right.

104
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,139
So what did you get?

105
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,060
Well, healthy food, of course.

106
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:22,100
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

107
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:22,699
Organic?

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,879
What's organic?

109
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,860
Do we need organic carrots?

110
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,420
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

111
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,240
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

112
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

113
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:37,139
Yep.

114
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,420
Better for the environment and better for us.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,740
Wait a minute.

116
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,040
What's that?

117
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,339
Donuts?

118
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,879
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

119
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,360
But I like donuts.

120
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,199
All right, we're back.

121
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,360
So now let's take a look at three key phrases on Fluency Builder.

122
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:01,019
Fluency Builder.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,399
This first key phrase is one that I think was very, very common in America in the late 80s, early 1990s.

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:16,040
People in America have been struggling with eating healthy food and not eating so much fatty food.

125
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,980
And so there was an emphasis on eating right.

126
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,259
That's right.

127
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,199
To eat right.

128
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,819
Now, how do you eat right?

129
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,699
I mean, it sounds like you want to eat with your spoon correctly.

130
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,319
No, eating right is more about the kind of food you eat.

131
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,740
It's about not eating pizza every day, pizza and hamburgers.

132
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,139
So we say eating right involves having a balanced diet.

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,680
That means eating vegetables and grains and a little bit of meat and not so many sweets or oils.

134
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,259
Okay.

135
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,319
So that's what it means when you are eating right.

136
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,459
So you have to eat right, that means eating healthy.

137
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,339
Now the opposite, if you're not eating healthy, that's because maybe you're eating too much junk food.

138
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,800
And that's our next phrase.

139
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:01,399
Right.

140
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,220
So junk food is, you know, junk garbage food.

141
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,620
It's the kind of food that is very unhealthy for you.

142
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Potato chips, pizza, ice cream.

143
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,860
It's all the best kind of food, but it's also the worst for your body.

144
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,980
So we call it junk food.

145
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:17,500
Okay.

146
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,060
So everything that's, for example, fast food is usually considered to be junk food.

147
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,220
Yes, it's high in oils and fats.

148
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,920
So junk food.

149
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,920
And for the last phrase for today, what is it?

150
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:31,899
Healthy lifestyle.

151
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,680
Oh, healthy lifestyle.

152
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,720
And for the last phrase, we are starting a healthy lifestyle.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,899
So what does he mean by a healthy lifestyle?

154
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,500
Well, we don't say life, we say lifestyle because this is the way in which a person lives.

155
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:47,899
It's your lifestyle.

156
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,040
Okay.

157
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:59,000
So this involves exercise, diet, what kind of food you eat, the way that you work, do you get too much sleep, not enough sleep.

158
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,660
So your lifestyle is about the choices you make in all parts of your life.

159
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,600
And so having a healthy lifestyle, as I said, it's not just about not eating junk food.

160
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,199
It's about running five miles or trying to get eight hours of sleep.

161
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,040
So it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:21,579
And usually in the news, we hear this phrase, not healthy life, but healthy lifestyle.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,920
So maybe somebody that leads a dangerous lifestyle maybe has a job that's very dangerous.

164
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:29,879
That's right.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,879
Or an unhealthy lifestyle, someone who eats one meal a day.

166
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,059
Okay.

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,059
Very good.

168
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,659
So those are key phrases for Fluency Builder.

169
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for the last time, and we'll be back to talk with you a little bit more.

170
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,919
Okay, darling, I got some pizzas, potato chips, hot dogs, and lots of cheese.

171
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,460
Oh, John, I thought we said we'd start eating right, remember, our new healthy lifestyle.

172
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,980
That's all junk food.

173
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:03,899
Huh.

174
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,340
Right.

175
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,340
So what did you get?

176
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,259
Well, healthy food, of course.

177
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,340
I got some whole wheat bread, skimmed milk, fresh fish, and organic carrots.

178
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:13,899
Organic?

179
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,080
What's organic?

180
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,019
Do we need organic carrots?

181
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:20,620
They were grown without using any chemicals that are harmful to our health.

182
00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:23,440
And yes, John, we need organic carrots.

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh, so organic vegetables are the green option, right?

184
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,320
Yep.

185
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,580
Better for the environment and better for us.

186
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,940
Wait a minute.

187
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,259
What's that?

188
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,559
Donuts?

189
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,080
Are they organic donuts, Kelly?

190
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,519
But I like donuts.

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,779
All right, we're back.

192
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:52,039
So talking about healthy food and healthy eating, how healthy do you eat, Catherine?

193
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,419
I think I eat pretty decently.

194
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,620
I try to eat a balanced diet.

195
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,139
Like I said earlier, I think a balanced diet is a key to a healthy lifestyle.

196
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,039
I don't really eat fast food.

197
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:04,679
Oh, really?

198
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,259
Yeah.

199
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,179
I try not to eat too much meat or too much sugar.

200
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,039
What about organic stuff?

201
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:15,259
Are you a big fan of organic vegetables, organic meats?

202
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:15,940
I am.

203
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,620
And this comes from a part of the dialogue we didn't cover.

204
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,340
One of the characters says that vegetables are the green option.

205
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:30,220
So trying to eat organic food and think about green is a part of thinking about the environment.

206
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:43,700
And so I think eating organic vegetables is an important part of caring about the environment because the more chemicals, the more pesticides we put into the world, the more harmful it is for the earth, for animals, and for ourselves.

207
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,779
Yeah, that's absolutely true.

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,039
And it has become a more popular aspect around America and Europe, people choosing to go with organic vegetables, for example, eggs that were grown on an organic farm.

209
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,940
And so it is the healthier option and obviously the green option as we saw in the dialogue.

210
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,799
Okay, so a very interesting topic.

211
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,200
We want to know what your opinion is on it.

212
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:19,820

214
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,000
Maybe.

215
