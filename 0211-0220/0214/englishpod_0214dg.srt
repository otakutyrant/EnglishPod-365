00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
EnglishPod.com Okay class, settle down.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am going to hand them out, and if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'll read mine!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, go ahead.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing, and easygoing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's not true.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, the test isn't 100% accurate.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is that all it says?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is stupid.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Okay, anyone else wants to read theirs?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll go.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It says I am generous, outspoken, and very diligent.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is so true.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent, and daring.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is totally me.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Whatever.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
These tests are baloney.
