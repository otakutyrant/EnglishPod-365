00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,980
EnglishPod.com Okay class, settle down.

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:10,460
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,220
I am going to hand them out, and if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,260
I'll read mine!

5
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:17,579
Okay, go ahead.

6
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:21,739
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing, and easygoing.

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,160
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,699
That's not true.

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,679
Well, the test isn't 100% accurate.

10
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,280
Is that all it says?

11
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:32,259
No.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,280
It also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,759
This is stupid.

14
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,640
Okay, anyone else wants to read theirs?

15
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:43,759
I'll go.

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,619
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,640
It says I am generous, outspoken, and very diligent.

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,100
This is so true.

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,659
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent, and daring.

20
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,420
This is totally me.

21
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:57,820
Whatever.

22
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,579
These tests are baloney.
