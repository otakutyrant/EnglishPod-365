00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,400
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,080
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:13,560
My name is Katherine, and today we've got a very, very interesting lesson for you all about building your vocabulary.

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,440
So we're trying to describe personalities.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,780
You're going to learn tons of new words.

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:19,640
Exactly.

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,480
And as you said, we're going to describe people's personalities, so not their physical attributes.

8
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:29,739
We're going to concentrate on how they are in personality-wise and stuff like that.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,739
Their character.

10
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:31,500
That's right.

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,020
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about some of these great words.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,759
Okay, class, settle down.

13
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,240
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
I am going to hand them out, and if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

15
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:55,079
I'll read mine.

16
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:56,380
Okay, go ahead.

17
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:00,520
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing, and easygoing.

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,939
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

19
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:05,480
That's not true.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,500
Well, the test isn't 100% accurate.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,060
Is that all it says?

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,079
No.

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,099
It also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

24
00:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,560
This is stupid.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:19,840
Okay.

26
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,459
Anyone else wants to read theirs?

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,540
I'll go.

28
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:25,420
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

29
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,439
It says I am generous, outspoken, and very diligent.

30
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:29,900
This is so true.

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,439
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent, and daring.

32
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,200
This is totally me.

33
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,480
Whatever.

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,379
These tests are baloney.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,540
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,980
So we're going to divide this up into language take-away parts one and two.

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,519
So let's start with five key words now on language take-away.

38
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,879
The first adjective that came up was adventurous and outgoing.

39
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,420
Outgoing, that's a good one.

40
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,239
Outgoing is a great one.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,659
So you think of the word out.

42
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,520
That means moving outgoing out.

43
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:19,280
Outgoing means someone is very comfortable talking to strangers or talking to people that they don't know very well.

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,979
For example, my brother is very outgoing.

45
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,139
He loves meeting new people.

46
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,000
He loves starting conversations with strangers.

47
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,020
So the opposite would be shy.

48
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,099
That's the opposite.

49
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,319
Okay, so outgoing.

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,139
And then it also described this person as being a little superstitious.

51
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,819
Okay, superstitious is very interesting because it's hard to describe since everyone's superstitions are different.

52
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,360
In many cultures, there are different superstitions.

53
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:53,900
So for example, in America, we say that walking under a ladder is bad luck.

54
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,659
Okay, or opening an umbrella inside is bad luck.

55
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,699
So if you believe that your actions will bring you bad luck, you're probably superstitious.

56
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:05,060
Okay, very good.

57
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:09,120
So if you are superstitious, you believe in superstitions.

58
00:03:09,699 --> 00:03:10,020
That's right.

59
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,599
So Marco, are you superstitious?

60
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,020
Do you think that black cats bring bad luck?

61
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,080
No, not at all.

62
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,419
No.

63
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,319
Interesting.

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,379
Alright, and this is also an interesting word, a way to describe people who are very believing a person that is naive.

65
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:26,659
Okay, you said this already.

66
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,539
Naive means that someone generally believes most things that you tell them.

67
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,060
So if I told you, Marco, hey, did you know that it's supposed to rain frogs tomorrow?

68
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,000
No way.

69
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,539
Really?

70
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,659
Yeah, really.

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,280
If Marco believes me, he's naive.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,219
That means that, you know, probably not going to rain frogs tomorrow, but he believes everything I say, so he's a little bit naive or inexperienced.

73
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,780
So naive is not really a bad way of describing a person, is it?

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,379
No, but it can be.

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,340
So you want to be careful.

76
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,699
You know, some people, if you say that they're being naive, it's offensive.

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,360
So you have to be careful when you say this.

78
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,719
Okay.

79
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:13,039
Moving on, we also had an interesting adjective that described another person, and it was to be reckless.

80
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
I can also be reckless.

81
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:15,319
Reckless.

82
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,220
Okay, so someone who is reckless often does things without thinking, sometimes things that are dangerous.

83
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:29,040
For example, Marco, I think that driving a car without wearing your seatbelt is very reckless.

84
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,040
Okay, that means that you're not thinking about safety.

85
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,600
Right.

86
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:40,160
So a person that is reckless is kind of a synonym of being a little bit dangerous to be around.

87
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:40,959
That's right.

88
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,319
Or someone who does things without thinking about their consequences, their results.

89
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:46,040
Okay.

90
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,480
And also along with reckless, the test said that this person was clumsy.

91
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,839
Oh, I love this word.

92
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,759
There was a very famous commercial when I was growing up in America on the television.

93
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:09,779
It was all about young students at high school who are clumsy, and so they should buy this special folder for their schoolwork to help them because they're so clumsy.

94
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,839
And they're dropping their papers and their books.

95
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:12,639
Exactly.

96
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:19,480
So someone who is clumsy often falls down or hits their head or trips or drops their things.

97
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,839
If I drop something on the floor and break it, my mother might say, you're so clumsy.

98
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,759
Clumsy fingers.

99
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,600
You should be more careful.

100
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,519
Yeah.

101
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,480
So clumsy, is this insulting if you say, oh, you're so clumsy?

102
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,980
No, it's not so bad.

103
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,379
There are worse things to say.

104
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,180
But if someone often drops things, you can call them clumsy.

105
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,500
Or you can also say, you're such a butter fingers.

106
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:44,540
Butter fingers.

107
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,819
That means that your fingers are like butter.

108
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,600
They're very slippery.

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
You drop everything.

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,339
Okay.

111
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,360
So clumsy and reckless, they are negative adjectives, right?

112
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:56,139
They're saying that you do things wrong.

113
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,759
So it's not really a good thing to be reckless or clumsy.

114
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,120
No, it's not really a good thing.

115
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,339
These are not positive characteristics.

116
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,339
Okay, good.

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,019
So we took a look at those five, which are very good about one of the people that took the test.

118
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:16,180
Let's move on now to more language and more adjectives on Language Takeaway Part Two.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,040
Language Takeaway.

120
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:22,819
All right.

121
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,100
So in this part, we're going to take a look at positive attributes about a person, right?

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,980
They're all good things about someone.

123
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,560
That's right.

124
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,680
And this first one is very good.

125
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:32,860
Extroverted.

126
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,199
Extroverted.

127
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,920
A person that's extroverted.

128
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,019
So a synonym of this word is outgoing.

129
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:39,600
Okay.

130
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,180
So it's pretty much the same thing.

131
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:41,740
That's right.

132
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,779
Because extro means going out.

133
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,620
Out.

134
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:56,379
So in this case, someone who is extroverted often meets new people, goes out and does social things, goes to the movies, goes out with friends, meets strangers, talks to strangers.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,019
Again, it's like being outgoing.

136
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:00,720
Someone who's comfortable with new people.

137
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,600
And what about the opposite?

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,480
So we said that shy is the opposite of outgoing.

139
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,540
What would be the opposite for extroverted?

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,019
Extroverted's opposite is introverted.

141
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,620
Intro means in, not out.

142
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,980
So that means someone who's very shy, who is uncomfortable with new people.

143
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:18,439
Okay.

144
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,220
And well, apart from being extroverted, the test also said that this person is very diligent.

145
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,000
Ooh, diligent is a great word.

146
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:30,379
This is a word you want to hear from your teachers and your bosses.

147
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,379
Okay.

148
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,279
If someone says, Marco, you are very diligent at work.

149
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:34,980
What does that mean?

150
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,560
It means you're very careful.

151
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
You always do things very thoroughly.

152
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,819
And also quickly, right?

153
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,560
When you tell them to do something, they do it immediately.

154
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,279
That's right.

155
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:50,100
So a diligent worker always does a good job and does it in a timely manner.

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Okay.

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,540
And moving on to our third adjective, this one is kind of strange.

158
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,360
It kind of sounds like monogamy, but it's magnanimous.

159
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,139
Magnanimous.

160
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,100
All right.

161
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,060
Magnanimous.

162
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,279
This is a great word.

163
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:11,699
We hear this a lot in the newspaper or on TV about usually famous people.

164
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,160
He did something very magnanimous or it was a magnanimous gesture.

165
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:27,060
This describes a person who does things for the benefit of other people, someone who is thinking about the well-being and the health and the lives of others.

166
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,500
So it would be a person that likes to share or a person that's not selfish.

167
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,240
Right.

168
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:40,820
So if you donate half of your salary this month to victims of an earthquake, I would say, Marco, that's so magnanimous of you.

169
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
You're so magnanimous.

170
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:42,620
Okay.

171
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,799
Awesome.

172
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,100
And apart from being magnanimous, if a person is eloquent, I guess that's also a positive attribute.

173
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:51,879
Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:53,320
This is another really good one.

175
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,080
Someone who is eloquent is a very good speaker.

176
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,600
This means that when they talk, they sound very, very good.

177
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,919
Someone who is eloquent uses big words but is also very good at making other people listen.

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Okay.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,240
So it's usually about speaking.

180
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,240
So you would say he's an eloquent speaker.

181
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:12,940
That's right.

182
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,360
So someone who is eloquent is fun or good or interesting to listen to.

183
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:17,940
Okay.

184
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,539
And our last description for personalities and the way people are is a person that's daring.

185
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:28,419
Well this can be a good thing or a bad thing.

186
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,960
It depends on who you're talking about because sometimes daring people are also reckless.

187
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,659
And this can be dangerous.

188
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:44,059
But sometimes someone who is daring can be doing good things like a daring business person might take risks that other people don't take.

189
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Okay.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,139
So a person that's daring dares to take risks, right?

191
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,340
You are very daring.

192
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,879
You, Marco, are daring because recently you jumped out of an airplane.

193
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:55,559
Right?

194
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,940
You did some skydiving.

195
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,220
So that would be considered daring.

196
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,059
That's very daring.

197
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,559
I'm not daring like that because I would never jump out of an airplane.

198
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:03,779
Right.

199
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,320
Okay.

200
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,820
So we took a look at basically ten key words here, a lot of adjectives, but they're a great way to describe yourself.

201
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:20,299
Maybe if you're at a job interview, sometimes a typical question is, how would you describe yourself using three adjectives?

202
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,899
I'm extroverted, I'm diligent, and I'm open-minded.

203
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,100
Yeah, that's awesome.

204
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:25,360
See?

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,039
You sound really professional when you say things like this.

206
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:29,059
Exactly.

207
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:39,019
So and even if you took a look at some of the negative adjectives that we used, it's also a typical job interview question is like, what are your biggest faults?

208
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,240
So you can say, well, maybe I am superstitious and naive, right?

209
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,919
You wouldn't want to say that in a job interview.

210
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,899
But I mean, I don't know, maybe.

211
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,580
Because you have to say something, right?

212
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:51,840
You do.

213
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,159
But I would say sometimes I'm a bit too daring or sometimes I take things personally.

214
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,860
So, well, we can talk about that another time.

215
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,100
But I think for now, it'd be good if we listen to today's dialogue one more time and really got a good sense of how to use these words.

216
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,320
OK, class, settle down.

217
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,759
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

218
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,460
I am going to hand them out.

219
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,539
And if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

220
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,620
I'll read mine.

221
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:26,899
OK, go ahead.

222
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,039
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing and easygoing.

223
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

224
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,000
That's not true.

225
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,019
Well, the test isn't 100 percent accurate.

226
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,580
Is that all it says?

227
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,639
No, it also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

228
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,159
This is stupid.

229
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,039
OK, anyone else wants to read theirs?

230
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,100
I'll go.

231
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,960
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

232
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,960
It says I am generous, outspoken and very diligent.

233
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,419
This is so true.

234
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,980
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent and daring.

235
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,779
This is totally me.

236
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:07,100
Whatever.

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,919
These tests are baloney.

238
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,799
All right, we're back.

239
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:26,259
So now going into descriptions, what are three adjectives that you would use to describe someone that is that you hate the most?

240
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:34,919
So going back to describing people, how would you describe like one of the main things that really irritate you about someone?

241
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,440
Maybe they if they are clumsy, it really bothers you that people are clumsy or reckless.

242
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,639
Maybe I see what you're saying.

243
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,820
Well, I really like extroverted, hardworking people.

244
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,940
But in English, we have a word to describe someone who is too extroverted, too hardworking.

245
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,700
And we call this person a type A personality, type A, type A, the letter A.

246
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:04,480
And this means someone who works very, very hard, who is very, very serious, but who's always anxious, always needs to get things done.

247
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,279
Right.

248
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,720
And so these people can be very hard to work with because they're controlling and they're never calm.

249
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,320
So they're not easygoing.

250
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,820
No, they're not easygoing.

251
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,399
They always want to do what they want to do.

252
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,019
They're usually not very good listeners.

253
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:33,039
And so this type A personality is something that I would say I'm not a big fan of at work or even when we're going out because, you know, with friends, it's hard to be around someone who always has to control you.

254
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,419
This is very interesting.

255
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:43,399
And I'm sure our listeners have a lot of different ways to describe things that irritate them, maybe about people or maybe attributes that they really admire about someone.

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,240
That's right.

257
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,100
And I want to give everybody a little bit of homework today.

258
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:55,059
Go home or if you're at home, look up a word in the dictionary that describes yourself.

259
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,559
Yeah, an adjective to describe yourself.

260
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,399
I think this is a really good homework assignment because you'll be improving your vocabulary and then put it on our website, EnglishPod.com.

261
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,940
Let us know more about you.

262
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,220
OK, we'll see everyone there.

263
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,779
Bye, everyone.

264
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,059
Bye.

265
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,559
Bye.
