00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My name is Katherine, and today we've got a very, very interesting lesson for you all about building your vocabulary.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So we're trying to describe personalities.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're going to learn tons of new words.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Exactly.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And as you said, we're going to describe people's personalities, so not their physical attributes.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We're going to concentrate on how they are in personality-wise and stuff like that.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Their character.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue for the first time, and we'll be back in a moment to talk about some of these great words.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay, class, settle down.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am going to hand them out, and if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll read mine.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, go ahead.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing, and easygoing.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's not true.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Well, the test isn't 100% accurate.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is that all it says?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is stupid.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Okay.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Anyone else wants to read theirs?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll go.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It says I am generous, outspoken, and very diligent.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is so true.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent, and daring.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is totally me.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Whatever.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
These tests are baloney.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right, we're back.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we're going to divide this up into language take-away parts one and two.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So let's start with five key words now on language take-away.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The first adjective that came up was adventurous and outgoing.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Outgoing, that's a good one.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Outgoing is a great one.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So you think of the word out.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That means moving outgoing out.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Outgoing means someone is very comfortable talking to strangers or talking to people that they don't know very well.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
For example, my brother is very outgoing.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He loves meeting new people.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He loves starting conversations with strangers.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So the opposite would be shy.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's the opposite.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay, so outgoing.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And then it also described this person as being a little superstitious.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, superstitious is very interesting because it's hard to describe since everyone's superstitions are different.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In many cultures, there are different superstitions.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So for example, in America, we say that walking under a ladder is bad luck.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, or opening an umbrella inside is bad luck.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So if you believe that your actions will bring you bad luck, you're probably superstitious.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, very good.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So if you are superstitious, you believe in superstitions.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So Marco, are you superstitious?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you think that black cats bring bad luck?

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, not at all.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Interesting.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright, and this is also an interesting word, a way to describe people who are very believing a person that is naive.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay, you said this already.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Naive means that someone generally believes most things that you tell them.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So if I told you, Marco, hey, did you know that it's supposed to rain frogs tomorrow?

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No way.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Really?

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yeah, really.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If Marco believes me, he's naive.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That means that, you know, probably not going to rain frogs tomorrow, but he believes everything I say, so he's a little bit naive or inexperienced.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So naive is not really a bad way of describing a person, is it?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, but it can be.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So you want to be careful.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, some people, if you say that they're being naive, it's offensive.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So you have to be careful when you say this.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Moving on, we also had an interesting adjective that described another person, and it was to be reckless.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can also be reckless.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Reckless.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, so someone who is reckless often does things without thinking, sometimes things that are dangerous.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For example, Marco, I think that driving a car without wearing your seatbelt is very reckless.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, that means that you're not thinking about safety.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Right.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So a person that is reckless is kind of a synonym of being a little bit dangerous to be around.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Or someone who does things without thinking about their consequences, their results.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And also along with reckless, the test said that this person was clumsy.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, I love this word.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There was a very famous commercial when I was growing up in America on the television.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It was all about young students at high school who are clumsy, and so they should buy this special folder for their schoolwork to help them because they're so clumsy.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And they're dropping their papers and their books.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Exactly.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So someone who is clumsy often falls down or hits their head or trips or drops their things.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If I drop something on the floor and break it, my mother might say, you're so clumsy.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Clumsy fingers.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You should be more careful.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So clumsy, is this insulting if you say, oh, you're so clumsy?

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, it's not so bad.

103
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There are worse things to say.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But if someone often drops things, you can call them clumsy.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Or you can also say, you're such a butter fingers.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Butter fingers.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That means that your fingers are like butter.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They're very slippery.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You drop everything.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So clumsy and reckless, they are negative adjectives, right?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They're saying that you do things wrong.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So it's not really a good thing to be reckless or clumsy.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No, it's not really a good thing.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
These are not positive characteristics.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay, good.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So we took a look at those five, which are very good about one of the people that took the test.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's move on now to more language and more adjectives on Language Takeaway Part Two.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Language Takeaway.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,000
All right.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So in this part, we're going to take a look at positive attributes about a person, right?

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
They're all good things about someone.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's right.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And this first one is very good.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Extroverted.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Extroverted.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
A person that's extroverted.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So a synonym of this word is outgoing.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay.

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So it's pretty much the same thing.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because extro means going out.

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Out.

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So in this case, someone who is extroverted often meets new people, goes out and does social things, goes to the movies, goes out with friends, meets strangers, talks to strangers.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Again, it's like being outgoing.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Someone who's comfortable with new people.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And what about the opposite?

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So we said that shy is the opposite of outgoing.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What would be the opposite for extroverted?

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Extroverted's opposite is introverted.

141
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Intro means in, not out.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So that means someone who's very shy, who is uncomfortable with new people.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Okay.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And well, apart from being extroverted, the test also said that this person is very diligent.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ooh, diligent is a great word.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is a word you want to hear from your teachers and your bosses.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If someone says, Marco, you are very diligent at work.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What does that mean?

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It means you're very careful.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You always do things very thoroughly.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And also quickly, right?

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When you tell them to do something, they do it immediately.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's right.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So a diligent worker always does a good job and does it in a timely manner.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And moving on to our third adjective, this one is kind of strange.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It kind of sounds like monogamy, but it's magnanimous.

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Magnanimous.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
All right.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Magnanimous.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is a great word.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We hear this a lot in the newspaper or on TV about usually famous people.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He did something very magnanimous or it was a magnanimous gesture.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This describes a person who does things for the benefit of other people, someone who is thinking about the well-being and the health and the lives of others.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So it would be a person that likes to share or a person that's not selfish.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Right.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So if you donate half of your salary this month to victims of an earthquake, I would say, Marco, that's so magnanimous of you.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're so magnanimous.

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Awesome.

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And apart from being magnanimous, if a person is eloquent, I guess that's also a positive attribute.

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, yeah.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is another really good one.

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Someone who is eloquent is a very good speaker.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This means that when they talk, they sound very, very good.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Someone who is eloquent uses big words but is also very good at making other people listen.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So it's usually about speaking.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So you would say he's an eloquent speaker.

181
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So someone who is eloquent is fun or good or interesting to listen to.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And our last description for personalities and the way people are is a person that's daring.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well this can be a good thing or a bad thing.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It depends on who you're talking about because sometimes daring people are also reckless.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And this can be dangerous.

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But sometimes someone who is daring can be doing good things like a daring business person might take risks that other people don't take.

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Okay.

190
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So a person that's daring dares to take risks, right?

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are very daring.

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You, Marco, are daring because recently you jumped out of an airplane.

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right?

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You did some skydiving.

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So that would be considered daring.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's very daring.

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not daring like that because I would never jump out of an airplane.

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So we took a look at basically ten key words here, a lot of adjectives, but they're a great way to describe yourself.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Maybe if you're at a job interview, sometimes a typical question is, how would you describe yourself using three adjectives?

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm extroverted, I'm diligent, and I'm open-minded.

203
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, that's awesome.

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,000
See?

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You sound really professional when you say things like this.

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Exactly.

207
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So and even if you took a look at some of the negative adjectives that we used, it's also a typical job interview question is like, what are your biggest faults?

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So you can say, well, maybe I am superstitious and naive, right?

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You wouldn't want to say that in a job interview.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But I mean, I don't know, maybe.

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Because you have to say something, right?

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You do.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But I would say sometimes I'm a bit too daring or sometimes I take things personally.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So, well, we can talk about that another time.

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I think for now, it'd be good if we listen to today's dialogue one more time and really got a good sense of how to use these words.

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
OK, class, settle down.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have the results of your individual personality tests.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I am going to hand them out.

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And if you'd like, you can read them out loud to the rest of the class.

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll read mine.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,000
OK, go ahead.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It says here that I am adventurous, outgoing and easygoing.

223
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It says that I'm a little superstitious and occasionally naive.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's not true.

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, the test isn't 100 percent accurate.

226
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is that all it says?

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, it also says that I'm open-minded with great ambition, but that I can also be reckless and clumsy.

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is stupid.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
OK, anyone else wants to read theirs?

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll go.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It says that I'm an extroverted, well-balanced person.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It says I am generous, outspoken and very diligent.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is so true.

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It also says that I am a magnanimous, eloquent and daring.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is totally me.

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Whatever.

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
These tests are baloney.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
All right, we're back.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So now going into descriptions, what are three adjectives that you would use to describe someone that is that you hate the most?

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So going back to describing people, how would you describe like one of the main things that really irritate you about someone?

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Maybe they if they are clumsy, it really bothers you that people are clumsy or reckless.

242
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Maybe I see what you're saying.

243
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Well, I really like extroverted, hardworking people.

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But in English, we have a word to describe someone who is too extroverted, too hardworking.

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And we call this person a type A personality, type A, type A, the letter A.

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And this means someone who works very, very hard, who is very, very serious, but who's always anxious, always needs to get things done.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Right.

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And so these people can be very hard to work with because they're controlling and they're never calm.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So they're not easygoing.

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No, they're not easygoing.

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They always want to do what they want to do.

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They're usually not very good listeners.

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And so this type A personality is something that I would say I'm not a big fan of at work or even when we're going out because, you know, with friends, it's hard to be around someone who always has to control you.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is very interesting.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I'm sure our listeners have a lot of different ways to describe things that irritate them, maybe about people or maybe attributes that they really admire about someone.

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's right.

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And I want to give everybody a little bit of homework today.

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Go home or if you're at home, look up a word in the dictionary that describes yourself.

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, an adjective to describe yourself.

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I think this is a really good homework assignment because you'll be improving your vocabulary and then put it on our website, EnglishPod.com.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let us know more about you.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
OK, we'll see everyone there.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Bye, everyone.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Bye.

265
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Bye.
