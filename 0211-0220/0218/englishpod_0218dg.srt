00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:10,679
EnglishPod.com Joanne, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay?

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,720
Let's just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly so we can go our separate ways, alright?

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,760
Fine with me.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,440
I just want to get this over with.

5
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,460
It's important we make a clean break.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,899
I should have signed a prenup.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:23,699
What was that?

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,519
Nothing.

9
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:26,079
Anyway, you're right.

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,699
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

11
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:33,960
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement.

12
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,140
I keep the cat and you get the dog, so that's done.

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:38,359
Finally.

14
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,600
Let's not go there, Joanne.

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,619
Okay, so let's start with the record collection.

16
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:48,579
I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

17
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,880
Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,259
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,840
He's my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway.

20
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:02,679
Whatever.

21
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,799
Alright, I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.

22
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:08,900
How typical.

23
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,680
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,560
Fine.

25
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,500
What's next?

27
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,599
What about these old photographs?

28
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,120
Which ones?

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,540
Let me have a look.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,599
Oh wow, look at that.

31
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:25,760
That brings back memories.

32
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:27,299
Remember that?

33
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:29,620
Our trip to Italy.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,019
I remember that day.

35
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,780
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain and we got caught in the rain.

36
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,459
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

37
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,840
I did take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain.

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,959
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,400
Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake?

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,659
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again?

41
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:57,200
I still love you.

42
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,359
Oh, Jeff, I love you too!

43
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,219
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

44
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:04,599
The motorcycle?

45
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,579
But that's mine!
