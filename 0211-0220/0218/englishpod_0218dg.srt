00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000
EnglishPod.com Joanne, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly so we can go our separate ways, alright?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Fine with me.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I just want to get this over with.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's important we make a clean break.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I should have signed a prenup.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What was that?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Nothing.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Anyway, you're right.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I keep the cat and you get the dog, so that's done.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Finally.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's not go there, Joanne.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, so let's start with the record collection.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He's my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Whatever.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Alright, I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How typical.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Fine.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What's next?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What about these old photographs?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which ones?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let me have a look.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh wow, look at that.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That brings back memories.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Remember that?

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Our trip to Italy.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I remember that day.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain and we got caught in the rain.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I did take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake?

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I still love you.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, Jeff, I love you too!

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The motorcycle?

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But that's mine!
