00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,320
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,019
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,099
My name is Katherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
It's kind of bitter.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a little bit sad, but it's also kind of sweet.

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:14,880
That's right.

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:18,559
We have a lesson today all about getting a divorce or divorcing someone.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,620
So this is what happens when two people's marriage ends.

9
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:24,440
They decide they want to leave each other.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,519
They have a divorce.

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,460
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,060
Anyway, you're right.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,679
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,939
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,159
I keep the cat, and you get the dog.

16
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,099
So that's done.

17
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:08,319
Finally.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,579
Well, let's not go there, Joanne.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,599
Okay, so let's start with the record collection.

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,560
I'll take the albums I contributed, and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,900
Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

22
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:28,239
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,819
He's my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,659
Whatever.

25
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:37,780
All right, I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,900
How typical.

27
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:41,640
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

28
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:42,540
Fine.

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,980
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

30
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,480
What's next?

31
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,579
What about these old photographs?

32
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,099
Which ones?

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,519
Let me have a look.

34
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,579
Oh wow, look at that.

35
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,760
That brings back memories.

36
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,319
Remember that?

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,579
Our trip to Italy.

38
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,000
I remember that day.

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,739
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain, and we got caught in the rain.

40
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,439
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

41
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,819
I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain.

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,939
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

43
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,479
Oh, Joanne.

44
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,379
Are we making a big mistake?

45
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,659
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again?

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,219
I still love you.

47
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,360
Oh Jeff, I love you too.

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,199
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,560
The motorcycle?

50
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,599
But that's mine.

51
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:45,120
All right, we're back, so now why don't we take a look at six key words on language takeaway.

52
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,340
Language takeaway.

53
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,280
Okay Marco, this first word is what we call an SAT word.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,939
That means it's very difficult.

55
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,919
It's so hard that many high school students in America study it before they go to college.

56
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,680
Acrimonious.

57
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:11,620
So the sentence starts off by saying, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is.

58
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:15,099
This divorce is very acrimonious, but let's not make it acrimonious.

59
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:18,180
Okay, so acrimonious would be?

60
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:18,860
Bitter.

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
Bitter, very complicated.

62
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,879
Hard, so people are emotional about it.

63
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,819
Joanne and Jeff are getting a divorce, they're very angry at each other.

64
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:32,939
So they're not having a peaceful divorce, this is the opposite.

65
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:35,000
It's very bitter, it's very angry.

66
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,419
Can you say this test is very acrimonious?

67
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:37,900
No.

68
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,120
Usually relationships are acrimonious, for example.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,599
Ever since they had that big fight, Jeff and Joanne's relationship has been very acrimonious.

70
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,180
Okay, awesome.

71
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,020
So acrimonious, a very hard word there.

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,759
As you say, many people study it to pass exams in order to go into college.

73
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,580
So now you know.

74
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:02,199
Now moving on, we have a very common legal term.

75
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,219
When people are getting married, they want to sign sometimes a prenup.

76
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,599
Yeah, you said it's common.

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,620
You hear this a lot in movies and TV.

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,780
Yeah, with celebrities.

79
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,219
Yeah, you read about celebrities.

80
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,779
So basically, a prenup is a short way of saying a prenuptial agreement.

81
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,079
Nuptial means having to do with marriage.

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:31,160
So basically, if you sign a prenup, you are agreeing to certain conditions before you get married.

83
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:37,759
That's right, it's a contract between future husband and future wife about what happens if they divorce.

84
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,560
For example, I decided not to get a prenup with my fiancÃ© because I don't think we'll get divorced.

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,180
But maybe he decided to get a prenup because in case they divorce, he wants to keep his car.

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,079
Right, so it usually happens a lot with celebrities, as we say, because they have a lot of money.

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,860
And if they get divorced, then usually it can get complicated, how much money the spouse gets, etc.

88
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:14,300
So maybe their prenuptial agreement or prenup will be that if they get divorced, the wife may get maybe a million dollars instead of $100 million.

89
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,000
Exactly.

90
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,939
It's a way many people protect themselves financially in case of divorce.

91
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:19,519
Very good.

92
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,680
Now moving on, another legal term and related to money is an alimony.

93
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,620
Okay, so let's look at the context of this word.

94
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:34,220
Joanne is talking and she says, My lawyer tells me you've accepted our alimony proposal.

95
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,800
Alimony, so this is probably something to do with money, right?

96
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:50,199
So she said that her lawyer has proposed an alimony and that's usually a settlement, an amount of money that you agree on when you get divorced.

97
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
Right, so this is exactly it.

98
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,759
In a divorce, this is how much money one person will pay the other.

99
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,639
That's right.

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,879
So if two people are married and when they get a divorce, their alimony may be the husband.

101
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:06,079
If he's got a lot of money, he will pay an alimony of $500,000.

102
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Right.

103
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:09,339
And so this is different from property, which is the next thing.

104
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:15,980
Division of property means that you talk about who will receive the car, the house, things like that.

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,819
Okay, very good.

106
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,740
So very complicated situations when you're getting divorced, prenups and alimony.

107
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,459
But moving on, they were talking about custody as well.

108
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,399
Custody of maybe children, maybe custody of their pets.

109
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:33,980
That's right.

110
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,220
So you talk about alimony.

111
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,959
This is money.

112
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,019
Property, which is things.

113
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,199
But what about people and animals?

114
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,579
This is called custody.

115
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,300
I want custody.

116
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:46,720
Custody means caring for something or looking after something.

117
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,000
You could say the child is in the grandmother's custody.

118
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,699
Okay, so in the care of the grandmother.

119
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,279
That's right.

120
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,040
So usually as well, when people get divorced, somebody gets custody of the children.

121
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,519
Right.

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,579
So he wants custody, but he doesn't have a job, so she will receive custody.

123
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,240
You could say that.

124
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,660
In this case, though, we're talking about custody of pets, animals.

125
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Right.

126
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,240
In this case, it's animals.

127
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,139
But it's actually true, right?

128
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,480
People, when they get divorced, they may ask the court for custody of their pets.

129
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,319
That's right.

130
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,240
And sometimes custody is what makes a divorce extremely acrimonious.

131
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,439
Yes.

132
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,439
Who gets to keep the children?

133
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,259
Who gets to keep the pets?

134
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:35,879
Now, moving on and a little bit away from legal terms, they were dividing up their property and saying, Well, I get to keep this.

135
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,680
You get to keep that.

136
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,420
And Joanne said, I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

137
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
So who cares about pets and money?

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,339
I want the gramophone.

139
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:47,899
Right.

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,339
All right.

141
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,079
So this is actually a word you don't hear very often anymore.

142
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:52,600
It's an old thing.

143
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,180
And that's what antique means, right?

144
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:55,139
Antique is old.

145
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:55,660
Right.

146
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,680
So antique.

147
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,279
This is an adjective here.

148
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,620
It can also be a noun.

149
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:07,339
An antique table, an antique gramophone is something that's very old, like 100 years old or 150 years old.

150
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:17,160
And a gramophone is one of those machines that you see in movies that play the old vinyl records and has like a big horn where the sound echoes.

151
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:18,220
That's right.

152
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,459
So in the 19th century, early 20th century, people didn't have CDs or MP3s or iPods.

153
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,480
This is how they listen to music.

154
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,660
So you usually have a hand crank.

155
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,639
You have to turn it.

156
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,139
Turn the machine and then the music will play and you can dance and do whatever.

157
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,440
Right.

158
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
So that's a gramophone.

159
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,000
Now, moving on to our last word.

160
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,059
Jeff said, You know what?

161
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,840
OK, fine.

162
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,940
Keep the gramophone.

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,940
All right.

164
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,840
I'll concede the silly gramophone.

165
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,080
So to concede to concede means to give up an argument.

166
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,639
OK, so you give up, you give in and you say, all right, take it.

167
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,980
That's exactly right.

168
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,720
So in this case, the argument is who will receive the gramophone?

169
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,139
They fight, they argue.

170
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:02,340
And finally, Jeff says, I concede.

171
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,899
OK, I give up.

172
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:04,919
You take it.

173
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,059
And is it only for things or can you also concede someone like you say somebody is right.

174
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,879
You can say that or an election.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,120
For example, there are two people who want to be president and the vote is counted.

176
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,019
And it's not clear who the president is.

177
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:21,779
And one person says, fine.

178
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:22,960
I concede.

179
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:24,299
That means I give up.

180
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:24,679
You win.

181
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,899
OK, very good.

182
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:26,879
So to concede.

183
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

184
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,559
Six key words there.

185
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,820
They're very interesting, especially the legal terms.

186
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,559
Very common.

187
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:40,559
And it's very it's very common and it's very useful for you to know next time you're watching maybe a movie or something related to this topic.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,500
Hopefully not the next time you're getting divorced.

189
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,820
But move let's move on now to four key phrases that we have for everyone on fluency builder.

190
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,360
Fluency builder.

191
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,960
Margot, let's get this over with.

192
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,759
I'm tired.

193
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,940
I want to go home.

194
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,679
Let's get it over with.

195
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,200
Come on.

196
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,899
Just just do it and get it over with.

197
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,259
All right.

198
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:06,759
So this is our first phrase in fluency builder to get this over with or to get it over with.

199
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:13,779
OK, so let's take that as a phrase and to get something over with means this just finish it quickly.

200
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,299
Let's stop delaying.

201
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,240
That's right.

202
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,179
This is a this is a way to ask to finish something quickly or to stop something.

203
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,639
So, for example, I have to go to the dentist later.

204
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,480
Maybe I really don't want to go.

205
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:30,740
I'll say to myself, let me just get this over with.

206
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,159
And once it's done, I don't have to worry about it.

207
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,120
Or maybe you have homework to do.

208
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,080
And instead of doing it later, you're like, OK, I'm going to do it now.

209
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,159
I just get it over with.

210
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:39,559
All right.

211
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,019
To get over with to get something over with.

212
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:42,620
OK.

213
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:50,899
And when they were talking about breaking up or separating, Joanne mentioned it's important we make a clean break.

214
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,120
What does she mean by making a clean break?

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,460
All right.

216
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,379
We hear this phrase all the time.

217
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:58,679
It's a very important phrase in the relationships.

218
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:04,960
It means when two people leave each other, you don't then call them or see each other or hang out.

219
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,659
It means a clean break.

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,500
You stop all together.

221
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:10,860
You stop something completely.

222
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,360
So you don't talk anymore.

223
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,600
You don't see each other anymore.

224
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:17,740
You you completely just stops contact with each other.

225
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,240
Exactly.

226
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,960
You can also say this about breaking something.

227
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,639
You could say it was a clean break.

228
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,759
When I broke my arm, it was a clean break.

229
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,240
There were no little pieces of bone or any problems.

230
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,440
It was a clean break.

231
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,480
That means completely broke.

232
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,519
OK.

233
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,440
So when we talk about clean break in a relationship, it means we completely break up.

234
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,059
We stop talking to each other.

235
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,120
And it's over with.

236
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,100
It's in the past.

237
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:42,559
Exactly.

238
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:43,440
All right.

239
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:50,419
So moving on, they were talking and completely arguing about I get the gramophone, I get the tea set.

240
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,879
And Joanne said, OK, fine.

241
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,620
I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary.

242
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,840
So you can hear her.

243
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,759
I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary.

244
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,740
So to drag something out means to extend, to make something longer, to make something take more time than it should.

245
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:13,299
OK.

246
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,580
So, for example, if someone's giving a speech, they may be dragging it out.

247
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,059
Right.

248
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,940
And you're right.

249
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,879
So if someone's giving a very long speech, you're like, oh, my God, he's dragging the speech out so long.

250
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Yeah.

251
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,840
When will he ever stop?

252
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:28,399
Right.

253
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,600
Or you could say in an argument, I'm tired of arguing.

254
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,120
Let's not drag this out anymore.

255
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:34,059
Let's just stop.

256
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:34,799
OK.

257
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:41,179
So to drag something out is usually time related to make things longer than necessary.

258
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:41,600
Exactly.

259
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,639
All right.

260
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:53,039
And for our last phrase, when Jeff was talking about the relationship, he says, I know a relationship has been on the rocks for some time.

261
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,679
OK, so the relationship was on the rocks.

262
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:59,919
OK, so this is an interesting phrase.

263
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,200
Think about rocks.

264
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,179
You know, you see rocks on the ground in the ocean.

265
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:09,360
Something that's on the rocks in this case means something that is not going well.

266
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Something that has problems.

267
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,480
Yes, it's not smooth.

268
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,899
So when Jeff says our relationship has been on the rocks, he's saying we fight a lot.

269
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,740
We have problems.

270
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,740
It's not working.

271
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:24,200
So if I say my company has been on the rocks recently, it means it's not doing very well.

272
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,860
Business is not going well.

273
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,179
OK, so you can use this for different things.

274
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,559
Now, obviously, you may have heard it before for drinks.

275
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,019
You say scotch on the rocks.

276
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:33,320
Right.

277
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:33,840
That's different.

278
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:35,919
Be careful in that sentence.

279
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,659
Mark was talking about ice, right?

280
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:38,980
Yeah.

281
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,259
So that's different if you ask for a drink on the rocks.

282
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:48,440
But if you describe yourself or your company or a relationship as being on the rocks, it means you're having a tough time.

283
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:49,919
It's a bad situation.

284
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,580
Exactly.

285
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,179
So it's a very useful phrase.

286
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:55,100
I think that's very native, very colloquial.

287
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,000
Absolutely.

288
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,039
It's a great phrase to use.

289
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,799
I encourage you.

290
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:03,519
I mean, I hope that your situation, your work and your relationships are not on the rocks.

291
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,639
But I do hope that when you're practicing speaking, you use this phrase a lot because it's it's really, really colloquial, like you say, Mark.

292
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,620
Yeah, it's really good.

293
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,799
So I think we've taken a look at a lot of phrases, a lot of vocab.

294
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,919
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for one last time.

295
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,259
You're right.

296
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,899
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

297
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:54,139
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement.

298
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,379
I keep the cat and you get the dog.

299
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,320
So that's done.

300
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:58,539
Finally.

301
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,799
Well, let's not go there, Joanne.

302
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,799
OK, so let's start with the record collection.

303
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,759
I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

304
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:09,539
Fine.

305
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,080
But I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

306
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,419
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

307
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,019
He's my grandfather and he never really liked you anyway.

308
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,860
Whatever.

309
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:24,080
All right.

310
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,980
I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.

311
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,100
How typical.

312
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,879
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

313
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:32,740
Fine.

314
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,179
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

315
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,659
What's next?

316
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,779
What about these old photographs?

317
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:40,299
Which ones?

318
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,740
Let me have a look.

319
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,200
Oh, wow.

320
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:43,799
Look at that.

321
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,940
That brings back memories.

322
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:47,460
Remember that?

323
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,799
Our trip to Italy.

324
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:51,179
I remember that day.

325
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,960
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain and we got caught in the rain.

326
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:57,659
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

327
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,019
I did take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain.

328
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,200
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

329
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,580
Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake?

330
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,820
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again?

331
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,360
I still love you.

332
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,620
Oh, Jeff, I love you, too.

333
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,399
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

334
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,779
The motorcycle?

335
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,779
But that's mine.

336
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,720
All right, we're back.

337
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,440
So a very interesting dialogue all about divorce.

338
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,960
Now, this is a very common situation nowadays in many countries such as the United States or Europe.

339
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,139
Divorce rates are very high lately, like in the past 10, 20 years.

340
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,940
Yeah, they do say that since maybe the 70s or 80s divorce rates have been on the rise.

341
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,480
I think the average now in America is about 50 percent.

342
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,200
Yeah, it's like five in 10 marriages and in divorce.

343
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:58,740
That's right.

344
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:10,680
And then from what I understand or I read once, I think out of those 50 percent that get divorced, if they remarry again, the probabilities of those that get remarried are again half.

345
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,000
So most likely people will get divorced at least twice.

346
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:14,839
That's true.

347
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,119
Although sometimes you meet people who got married when they were very, very young.

348
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:26,839
And they realize that they grew up a little bit and their personality changed or their goals changed and they divorced that one time.

349
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,680
But then later in life, when they marry again, they know who they are.

350
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,980
They get married again and it's better.

351
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,380
So I think the situations are all quite different.

352
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,700
But it is true that there are a lot of a lot of divorces in America.

353
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,140
What about Ecuador, though?

354
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,660
I mean, is the divorce rate similar?

355
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,440
No, not really.

356
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,180
I think people are still a little bit more old fashioned in that sense, like it was before.

357
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,240
You know, it was even a little bit taboo to be divorced.

358
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:54,960
Yeah, but I don't think people get divorced as often, especially if people have been together for quite a while.

359
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,740
That's one of the things that surprises me a lot is I've met people who have been married 20, 30 years and then get divorced.

360
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:06,140
It's like what is like you've been through the toughest times.

361
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,680
You know, you've pretty much beat the odds.

362
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,339
And why do you get divorced at such a late age?

363
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah, it does seem counterintuitive, but it's possible that they were unhappy for that time and they didn't want to affect their children's lives.

364
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:17,799
Right.

365
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:23,539
And so when their children go to college or leave, they say, OK, now I can I can make a big decision.

366
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,000
I know in countries, for example, such as Chile, divorce is still illegal, I think in the Philippines as well.

367
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:29,400
Really?

368
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:31,359
Yeah, it's still illegal to get divorced.

369
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,240
Is that because they're very religious countries?

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,619
I know Chile is not really that religious.

371
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,220
I don't know what it is exactly by law, but a lot of people I think it may be legal now.

372
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,420
I can't really remember very well.

373
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,720
I think one of our Chilean listeners can help us out here.

374
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,680
But I know a lot of people used to annul their marriages because of this.

375
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,019
I see.

376
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
So they would be like, oh, I put the wrong address.

377
00:18:51,619 --> 00:18:53,599
So no, this marriage is not valid.

378
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,380
Or I spelled my name wrong.

379
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Yeah.

380
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,779
Interesting.

381
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:04,259
Well, I'd be curious to know, as you said, whether any of our Chilean friends know more about this or for the rest of you in your country, is divorce common?

382
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,039
Is it uncommon?

383
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,359
Are there laws that prohibit or that allow divorce?

384
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,339
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

385
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:10,660
All right.

386
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:11,359
We'll see you guys there.

387
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:11,640
Bye.
