00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My name is Katherine, and today we have an upper intermediate level lesson.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's kind of bitter.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a little bit sad, but it's also kind of sweet.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We have a lesson today all about getting a divorce or divorcing someone.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So this is what happens when two people's marriage ends.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They decide they want to leave each other.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They have a divorce.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So let's take a listen to today's dialogue, and we'll be back in a moment.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Anyway, you're right.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I keep the cat, and you get the dog.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So that's done.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Finally.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, let's not go there, Joanne.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, so let's start with the record collection.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll take the albums I contributed, and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He's my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Whatever.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All right, I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How typical.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Fine.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's next?

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What about these old photographs?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Which ones?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let me have a look.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh wow, look at that.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That brings back memories.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Remember that?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Our trip to Italy.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I remember that day.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain, and we got caught in the rain.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, Joanne.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are we making a big mistake?

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again?

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I still love you.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh Jeff, I love you too.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The motorcycle?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But that's mine.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
All right, we're back, so now why don't we take a look at six key words on language takeaway.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Language takeaway.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay Marco, this first word is what we call an SAT word.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That means it's very difficult.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's so hard that many high school students in America study it before they go to college.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Acrimonious.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So the sentence starts off by saying, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This divorce is very acrimonious, but let's not make it acrimonious.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay, so acrimonious would be?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Bitter.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Bitter, very complicated.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hard, so people are emotional about it.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Joanne and Jeff are getting a divorce, they're very angry at each other.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So they're not having a peaceful divorce, this is the opposite.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's very bitter, it's very angry.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Can you say this test is very acrimonious?

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Usually relationships are acrimonious, for example.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ever since they had that big fight, Jeff and Joanne's relationship has been very acrimonious.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay, awesome.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So acrimonious, a very hard word there.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
As you say, many people study it to pass exams in order to go into college.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So now you know.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now moving on, we have a very common legal term.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When people are getting married, they want to sign sometimes a prenup.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, you said it's common.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You hear this a lot in movies and TV.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, with celebrities.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, you read about celebrities.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So basically, a prenup is a short way of saying a prenuptial agreement.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Nuptial means having to do with marriage.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So basically, if you sign a prenup, you are agreeing to certain conditions before you get married.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That's right, it's a contract between future husband and future wife about what happens if they divorce.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For example, I decided not to get a prenup with my fiancÃ© because I don't think we'll get divorced.

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But maybe he decided to get a prenup because in case they divorce, he wants to keep his car.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Right, so it usually happens a lot with celebrities, as we say, because they have a lot of money.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And if they get divorced, then usually it can get complicated, how much money the spouse gets, etc.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So maybe their prenuptial agreement or prenup will be that if they get divorced, the wife may get maybe a million dollars instead of $100 million.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Exactly.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's a way many people protect themselves financially in case of divorce.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Very good.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now moving on, another legal term and related to money is an alimony.

93
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so let's look at the context of this word.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Joanne is talking and she says, My lawyer tells me you've accepted our alimony proposal.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Alimony, so this is probably something to do with money, right?

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So she said that her lawyer has proposed an alimony and that's usually a settlement, an amount of money that you agree on when you get divorced.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Right, so this is exactly it.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In a divorce, this is how much money one person will pay the other.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So if two people are married and when they get a divorce, their alimony may be the husband.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If he's got a lot of money, he will pay an alimony of $500,000.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Right.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And so this is different from property, which is the next thing.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Division of property means that you talk about who will receive the car, the house, things like that.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, very good.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So very complicated situations when you're getting divorced, prenups and alimony.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But moving on, they were talking about custody as well.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Custody of maybe children, maybe custody of their pets.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So you talk about alimony.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is money.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Property, which is things.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But what about people and animals?

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is called custody.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I want custody.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Custody means caring for something or looking after something.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You could say the child is in the grandmother's custody.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, so in the care of the grandmother.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's right.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So usually as well, when people get divorced, somebody gets custody of the children.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So he wants custody, but he doesn't have a job, so she will receive custody.

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You could say that.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In this case, though, we're talking about custody of pets, animals.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Right.

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
In this case, it's animals.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But it's actually true, right?

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
People, when they get divorced, they may ask the court for custody of their pets.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's right.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And sometimes custody is what makes a divorce extremely acrimonious.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who gets to keep the children?

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Who gets to keep the pets?

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Now, moving on and a little bit away from legal terms, they were dividing up their property and saying, Well, I get to keep this.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You get to keep that.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And Joanne said, I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So who cares about pets and money?

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I want the gramophone.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Right.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All right.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So this is actually a word you don't hear very often anymore.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's an old thing.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And that's what antique means, right?

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Antique is old.

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Right.

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So antique.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is an adjective here.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It can also be a noun.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
An antique table, an antique gramophone is something that's very old, like 100 years old or 150 years old.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And a gramophone is one of those machines that you see in movies that play the old vinyl records and has like a big horn where the sound echoes.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So in the 19th century, early 20th century, people didn't have CDs or MP3s or iPods.

153
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is how they listen to music.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So you usually have a hand crank.

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You have to turn it.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Turn the machine and then the music will play and you can dance and do whatever.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Right.

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So that's a gramophone.

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now, moving on to our last word.

160
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Jeff said, You know what?

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,000
OK, fine.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Keep the gramophone.

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,000
All right.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll concede the silly gramophone.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So to concede to concede means to give up an argument.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
OK, so you give up, you give in and you say, all right, take it.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's exactly right.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So in this case, the argument is who will receive the gramophone?

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They fight, they argue.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And finally, Jeff says, I concede.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
OK, I give up.

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You take it.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And is it only for things or can you also concede someone like you say somebody is right.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can say that or an election.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
For example, there are two people who want to be president and the vote is counted.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it's not clear who the president is.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And one person says, fine.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I concede.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That means I give up.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You win.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OK, very good.

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So to concede.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
All right.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Six key words there.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
They're very interesting, especially the legal terms.

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Very common.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And it's very it's very common and it's very useful for you to know next time you're watching maybe a movie or something related to this topic.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hopefully not the next time you're getting divorced.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But move let's move on now to four key phrases that we have for everyone on fluency builder.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Fluency builder.

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Margot, let's get this over with.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm tired.

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I want to go home.

194
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's get it over with.

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come on.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Just just do it and get it over with.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All right.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So this is our first phrase in fluency builder to get this over with or to get it over with.

199
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,000
OK, so let's take that as a phrase and to get something over with means this just finish it quickly.

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's stop delaying.

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
This is a this is a way to ask to finish something quickly or to stop something.

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So, for example, I have to go to the dentist later.

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Maybe I really don't want to go.

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll say to myself, let me just get this over with.

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And once it's done, I don't have to worry about it.

207
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or maybe you have homework to do.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And instead of doing it later, you're like, OK, I'm going to do it now.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I just get it over with.

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
All right.

211
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
To get over with to get something over with.

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
OK.

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And when they were talking about breaking up or separating, Joanne mentioned it's important we make a clean break.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What does she mean by making a clean break?

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All right.

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We hear this phrase all the time.

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's a very important phrase in the relationships.

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It means when two people leave each other, you don't then call them or see each other or hang out.

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It means a clean break.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You stop all together.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You stop something completely.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So you don't talk anymore.

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You don't see each other anymore.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You you completely just stops contact with each other.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Exactly.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can also say this about breaking something.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You could say it was a clean break.

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
When I broke my arm, it was a clean break.

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There were no little pieces of bone or any problems.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It was a clean break.

231
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That means completely broke.

232
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,000
OK.

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So when we talk about clean break in a relationship, it means we completely break up.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We stop talking to each other.

235
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And it's over with.

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's in the past.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Exactly.

238
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All right.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So moving on, they were talking and completely arguing about I get the gramophone, I get the tea set.

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And Joanne said, OK, fine.

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary.

242
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So you can hear her.

243
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary.

244
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So to drag something out means to extend, to make something longer, to make something take more time than it should.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,000
OK.

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So, for example, if someone's giving a speech, they may be dragging it out.

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Right.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And you're right.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So if someone's giving a very long speech, you're like, oh, my God, he's dragging the speech out so long.

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yeah.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When will he ever stop?

252
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Right.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Or you could say in an argument, I'm tired of arguing.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's not drag this out anymore.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let's just stop.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,000
OK.

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So to drag something out is usually time related to make things longer than necessary.

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Exactly.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,000
All right.

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And for our last phrase, when Jeff was talking about the relationship, he says, I know a relationship has been on the rocks for some time.

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
OK, so the relationship was on the rocks.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
OK, so this is an interesting phrase.

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Think about rocks.

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You know, you see rocks on the ground in the ocean.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Something that's on the rocks in this case means something that is not going well.

266
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Something that has problems.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, it's not smooth.

268
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So when Jeff says our relationship has been on the rocks, he's saying we fight a lot.

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We have problems.

270
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not working.

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So if I say my company has been on the rocks recently, it means it's not doing very well.

272
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Business is not going well.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
OK, so you can use this for different things.

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Now, obviously, you may have heard it before for drinks.

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You say scotch on the rocks.

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Right.

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's different.

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Be careful in that sentence.

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Mark was talking about ice, right?

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah.

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So that's different if you ask for a drink on the rocks.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But if you describe yourself or your company or a relationship as being on the rocks, it means you're having a tough time.

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's a bad situation.

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Exactly.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
So it's a very useful phrase.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think that's very native, very colloquial.

287
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Absolutely.

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a great phrase to use.

289
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I encourage you.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I mean, I hope that your situation, your work and your relationships are not on the rocks.

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I do hope that when you're practicing speaking, you use this phrase a lot because it's it's really, really colloquial, like you say, Mark.

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yeah, it's really good.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
So I think we've taken a look at a lot of phrases, a lot of vocab.

294
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue for one last time.

295
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're right.

296
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There's no reason this has to be nasty.

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
My lawyer tells me that you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement.

298
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I keep the cat and you get the dog.

299
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So that's done.

300
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Finally.

301
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Well, let's not go there, Joanne.

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
OK, so let's start with the record collection.

303
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Fine.

305
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.

306
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne, and you hardly ever use it.

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's my grandfather and he never really liked you anyway.

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Whatever.

309
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
All right.

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll concede the silly gramophone if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How typical.

312
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
When are you ever going to use a silver tea set?

313
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Fine.

314
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't want to drag this out any more than necessary.

315
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's next?

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What about these old photographs?

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Which ones?

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let me have a look.

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, wow.

320
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Look at that.

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That brings back memories.

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Remember that?

323
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Our trip to Italy.

324
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I remember that day.

325
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We were going to visit the Trevi Fountain and we got caught in the rain.

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And you looked so adorable with your hair all wet.

327
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I did take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain.

328
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we?

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake?

330
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I know our relationship has been on the rocks for some time, but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again?

331
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I still love you.

332
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, Jeff, I love you, too.

333
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.

334
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The motorcycle?

335
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But that's mine.

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All right, we're back.

337
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
So a very interesting dialogue all about divorce.

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Now, this is a very common situation nowadays in many countries such as the United States or Europe.

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Divorce rates are very high lately, like in the past 10, 20 years.

340
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, they do say that since maybe the 70s or 80s divorce rates have been on the rise.

341
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I think the average now in America is about 50 percent.

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, it's like five in 10 marriages and in divorce.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right.

344
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:10,000
And then from what I understand or I read once, I think out of those 50 percent that get divorced, if they remarry again, the probabilities of those that get remarried are again half.

345
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So most likely people will get divorced at least twice.

346
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's true.

347
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Although sometimes you meet people who got married when they were very, very young.

348
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And they realize that they grew up a little bit and their personality changed or their goals changed and they divorced that one time.

349
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But then later in life, when they marry again, they know who they are.

350
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
They get married again and it's better.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So I think the situations are all quite different.

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But it is true that there are a lot of a lot of divorces in America.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What about Ecuador, though?

354
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I mean, is the divorce rate similar?

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
No, not really.

356
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think people are still a little bit more old fashioned in that sense, like it was before.

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You know, it was even a little bit taboo to be divorced.

358
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yeah, but I don't think people get divorced as often, especially if people have been together for quite a while.

359
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's one of the things that surprises me a lot is I've met people who have been married 20, 30 years and then get divorced.

360
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's like what is like you've been through the toughest times.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You know, you've pretty much beat the odds.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And why do you get divorced at such a late age?

363
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah, it does seem counterintuitive, but it's possible that they were unhappy for that time and they didn't want to affect their children's lives.

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Right.

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And so when their children go to college or leave, they say, OK, now I can I can make a big decision.

366
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know in countries, for example, such as Chile, divorce is still illegal, I think in the Philippines as well.

367
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Really?

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, it's still illegal to get divorced.

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is that because they're very religious countries?

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I know Chile is not really that religious.

371
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't know what it is exactly by law, but a lot of people I think it may be legal now.

372
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I can't really remember very well.

373
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think one of our Chilean listeners can help us out here.

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I know a lot of people used to annul their marriages because of this.

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I see.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So they would be like, oh, I put the wrong address.

377
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So no, this marriage is not valid.

378
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Or I spelled my name wrong.

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Yeah.

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Interesting.

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, I'd be curious to know, as you said, whether any of our Chilean friends know more about this or for the rest of you in your country, is divorce common?

382
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Is it uncommon?

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are there laws that prohibit or that allow divorce?

384
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let us know on our website, EnglishPod.com.

385
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
All right.

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We'll see you guys there.

387
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Bye.
