00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,599
Hello, everyone, and welcome to EnglishPod.

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:06,339
My name is Marco.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,519
My name is Catherine, and today we have an elementary level lesson for you.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,919
This one is especially for people who are interested in babies.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:14,839
That's right.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:22,839
Maybe you have a baby, you will have a baby, maybe you're pregnant, and this is a great lesson for that because we are talking about a baby shower.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,579
Okay, so before we get started, let's take a look at vocabulary preview and learn what exactly a baby shower is.

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,640
Vocabulary preview.

9
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:34,280
Okay, so a baby shower.

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,500
You would think that this is about bathing the baby, about giving the baby a bath.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,359
No, not a real shower.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,320
A baby shower or a bridal shower, these are parties.

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:45,659
Okay, they're parties.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,340
And in this case, a baby shower is a party that you throw for a woman that is pregnant, right?

15
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,159
That's right.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,600
So if my sister is going to have a baby, I throw her a baby shower.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,679
It's a party where all of her friends give her gifts.

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,219
Okay.

19
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,760
Yeah, it's a way to celebrate having a baby.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,439
Okay, so they give her gifts, you'll play games as well as to like maybe guess the name of the baby or guess the sex of the baby.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,959
Exactly.

22
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:15,680
Stuff like that.

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,739
Okay, so it's a very common thing.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,040
I think it's mostly for women.

25
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,920
I don't really know if men have baby showers as well.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,879
I don't think so.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:30,519
I don't think so either, but it's a very popular tradition in the United States and many other parts of the world.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,260
So we're going to talk about that.

29
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,700
Let's listen to the dialogue for the first time.

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,439
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

31
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:48,079
I've always been to baby showers, but never actually had one held for me.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,340
Let's get started.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,159
Okay, let's start opening some presents.

34
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,439
Oh, look, what a great little bib for the baby.

35
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,420
This will definitely come in handy.

36
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,480
Oh, wow, you also got me a stroller.

37
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,819
That's so great.

38
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,819
Thank you.

39
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,239
This next one is from Betty.

40
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,439
A hot chair and a car seat.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,020
Wow, Betty, thank you so much.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
I really appreciate it.

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,460
One more from Carla.

44
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,439
A playpen and crib.

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,879
Thanks Carla.

46
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,319
This is just what I needed.

47
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,639
Okay, that's all of them.

48
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,759
No more gifts.

49
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,900
Now, who wants to guess when the baby is due?

50
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,979
Um, I think my water just broke.

51
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,219
Get me to a hospital.

52
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:38,319
All right, so very interesting.

53
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:46,659
All the gifts that they got and definitely very useful because this is a very common items that you get for babies, right?

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,340
That's right.

55
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:55,979
And all of this stuff is really, really valuable because if you have a baby or if your brother or sister has a baby, you'll notice that these are very common items.

56
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,300
So let's go through a couple of them in today's language takeaway.

57
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,000
Language takeaway.

58
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:10,400
Okay, so the first word that we're going to take a look at, the most common one and useful one for a baby is a bib.

59
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:11,139
Bib.

60
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,419
So babies are messy.

61
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,240
When they eat food, they get their food on their clothes.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,439
So to protect the clothes, babies wear bibs.

63
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,500
This is a piece of cloth or fabric around their neck.

64
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,039
Okay, a bib.

65
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:32,139
And also sometimes you want to go out with your baby to the mall, you're walking and you don't want to carry him in your arms all the time.

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,699
So you need a stroller.

67
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,340
Okay, so basically a stroller is a chair on wheels for a baby.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,960
Babies are heavy and as they get older, they get heavier.

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,860
And so this is a way to push the baby around, not carry the baby.

70
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,099
Right, and maybe the baby falls asleep so they can fall asleep in the stroller.

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,599
Exactly.

72
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,259
Okay, and while talking about chairs, we're going to take a look at two different types of chairs.

73
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,599
First one is a high chair.

74
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,259
Okay, a high chair.

75
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,500
Think about the word high.

76
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,199
That means tall in this case.

77
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,020
A high chair is a chair for babies at the table.

78
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,659
So if you put a baby on a regular chair, they can't eat with adults.

79
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,479
They're too small.

80
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:18,220
So we give them high chairs so that they can sit a little bit higher and they can be at the table with adults.

81
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,560
Exactly, so they're very common.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,959
For example, you go to a restaurant, they will have a little high chairs if you have a baby or a small child.

83
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,120
So if you're at a restaurant and you have a baby, you ask for a high chair.

84
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,420
You say, do you have a high chair please?

85
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,420
Yeah, perfect.

86
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:41,040
And well, if you're going to the restaurant or you go anywhere in your car, you need to have the baby be safe.

87
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,459
And obviously, they can't fit on a normal, you know, seat with the seat belt.

88
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,600
No, I don't think so.

89
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,959
So that's why you get them a car seat.

90
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,379
Okay, a car seat is a special chair that goes on the seat of the car.

91
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,740
And usually it's very, very safe.

92
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,480
It's protecting, it's made to protect the baby.

93
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,040
Right.

94
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,279
So if you are ever in a car accident, the car seat will help protect the small baby.

95
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:06,639
Right.

96
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,899
And car seats are supposed to go in the back of the car, not the front.

97
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes, always.

98
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,060
Very good.

99
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:15,319
And now moving on to our last two words.

100
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,959
If you're at home, you sometimes want to have the baby play and you get him a playpen.

101
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,560
So basically, this is a way for parents to leave the baby playing but not look at the baby the whole time.

102
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:27,879
Right.

103
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,560
A playpen is like a cage for a baby, but it's soft and it's cute and it's pretty.

104
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,939
And so it's basically like an open area that's protected on the sides and the baby can go inside, but the baby can't leave.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,019
It's like a cage basically and it has little toys and that's the way you just keep them in there.

106
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:50,939
All right.

107
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:57,019
And now when you want to put the baby to sleep, it can't obviously sleep in a big bed because it might roll over, it might fall off.

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,939
There's a lot of things that can go wrong.

109
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,300
So you get them a crib.

110
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:00,939
Right.

111
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,959
So a crib is a bed for babies.

112
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,759
This is usually high off the ground and it's usually quite small and the baby can't climb out of it.

113
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:09,180
Right.

114
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:09,639
Yeah.

115
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,360
So it's a very safe bed so the baby can't fall out, can't climb out.

116
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,879
Exactly.

117
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:15,959
Very good.

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,639
So very interesting, very useful things for you if you're having a baby, planning on getting these things.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,500
So why don't we go back, listen to the dialogue again and we'll be back with Fluency Builder.

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,800
Thank you for organising this great baby shower for me.

121
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,439
I've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me.

122
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:38,720
Let's get started.

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:39,939
Okay.

124
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,279
Let's start opening some presents.

125
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,560
Oh look.

126
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,800
What a great little bib for the baby.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,779
This will definitely come in handy.

128
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,019
Oh wow.

129
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,819
You also got me a stroller.

130
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,180
That's so great.

131
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,180
Thank you.

132
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,639
This next one is from Betty.

133
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,800
A high chair and a car seat.

134
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,360
Wow Betty, thank you so much.

135
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:01,800
I really appreciate it.

136
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,800
One more from Carla.

137
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:05,800
A playpen and crib.

138
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,240
Thanks Carla.

139
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,680
This is just what I needed.

140
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:09,819
Okay.

141
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,980
That's all of them.

142
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,120
No more gifts.

143
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,259
Now who wants to guess when the baby is due?

144
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,319
Um, I think my water just broke.

145
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,540
Get me to a hospital.

146
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,279
Ahhh!

147
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,259
Alright, we're back.

148
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,319
So now let's take a look at two key phrases.

149
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,019
Fluency builder.

150
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,779
Okay, so at the beginning of the dialogue, the woman receives a bib for the baby and she says, oh, this will definitely come in handy.

151
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,180
To come in handy.

152
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:40,699
Right.

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,319
So when something comes in handy, it means it will be useful.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,139
Okay.

155
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,420
So something that's handy is useful.

156
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,180
To come in handy means to be useful.

157
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,920
It will be useful in the future.

158
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:59,019
So for example, you should take a flashlight with you in the car, just in case, because it could come in handy.

159
00:07:59,319 --> 00:07:59,740
That's right.

160
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,699
Or if I know that Marco is traveling to India, I can give him a map of India.

161
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,620
I say Marco, this map might come in handy.

162
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,339
Exactly.

163
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,399
Very good.

164
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,540
So to come in handy or in something that is handy, something that's useful.

165
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:22,199
And towards the end, a very popular phrase, you probably heard it in every movie that has like maybe a pregnant woman in there.

166
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,540
Oh, yes.

167
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,459
My water just broke.

168
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,319
My water broke.

169
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:25,920
Okay.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,519
So the woman says, ah, my water broke.

171
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:29,759
Take me to the hospital.

172
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:30,279
Right.

173
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:30,839
Okay.

174
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,840
So this means I'm having my baby right now.

175
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,340
So why do they say that the water broke?

176
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,039
Because actually water kind of breaks, right?

177
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,100
I think there's a protective water cushion.

178
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,679
Basically, there's a sack of water protecting the baby.

179
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,559
It's not just water.

180
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,059
It's all sorts of like body fluids.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:59,659
And basically, when that breaks, it comes out and you know that you're going to have the baby because that means the baby has to come out now because that protective fluid is gone.

182
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:03,360
Maybe the baby just kind of kicks that water out and just like, I'm ready to come out.

183
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,679
I have no idea how it works.

184
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,320
All right.

185
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,740
So very interesting stuff.

186
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:09,379
Why don't we listen to the dialogue for the last time?

187
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:20,360
Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

188
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,019
I've always been to baby showers, but never actually had one held for me.

189
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,279
Let's get started.

190
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:26,440
Okay.

191
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's start opening some presents.

192
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,379
Oh, look, what a great little bib for the baby.

193
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,340
This will definitely come in handy.

194
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,600
Oh, wow.

195
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,399
You also got me a stroller.

196
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,740
That's so great.

197
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,720
Thank you.

198
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,159
This next one is from Betty.

199
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,360
Oh, hi, chair and a car seat.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,720
Wow, Betty.

201
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,919
Thank you so much.

202
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,340
I really appreciate it.

203
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,379
One more from Carla.

204
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:52,360
A playpen and crib.

205
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,799
Thanks, Carla.

206
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,240
This is just what I needed.

207
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:56,340
Okay.

208
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,559
That's all of them.

209
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,700
No more gifts.

210
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,820
Now who wants to guess when the baby is due?

211
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,899
Um, I think my water just broke.

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
Get me to a hospital.

213
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:06,980
Ah!

214
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,840
All right.

215
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:20,259
So talking about baby things and baby showers, it's a very interesting tradition.

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,159
I understand that in other countries, they don't really celebrate baby showers like this.

217
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:24,519
Really?

218
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:25,200
Yeah.

219
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,320
Or that if they do, they do it in different ways.

220
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:35,200
I know, for example, that sometimes in Latin American countries, they usually do it after the baby's born.

221
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:35,960
Oh.

222
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,039
So like a congratulations shower.

223
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,639
Exactly.

224
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:45,899
And then obviously you know if the baby was a boy or a girl, so then you get them like pink things or blue things, so it's a little bit more...

225
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:47,299
That's what's really funny about these.

226
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:53,720
People often want to have the surprise of not knowing if the baby will be a boy or a girl.

227
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,480
So when they have the baby shower, they say, oh, I don't know what the gender is.

228
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,820
And so you end up buying all of these yellow things, because yellow is neutral, it's good for boys and girls.

229
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:05,220
Yeah.

230
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,200
I don't know how many yellow gifts I've gotten.

231
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:18,500
I think it's a very interesting thing, because for example, I know that in China, I think you can't ask the doctor for the gender of the baby before it's born, right?

232
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,080
I think that's a way to...

233
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,519
I'm not sure if it's a rule or not, but it sounds right.

234
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:25,340
I mean, it's a way to protect female babies.

235
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,460
I think it would be always great to just have it be a surprise.

236
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:29,980
You never know.

237
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:30,340
Yeah.

238
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,220
Just like, oh, you know, whatever comes out.

239
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,539
Can you imagine not knowing and then you have twins?

240
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:40,440
That would be great for me, I think, if I had like a boy and a girl, bam, all at once.

241
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:40,980
All at once.

242
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,200
Never have to worry about it again.

243
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,379
And then you have the best of both worlds, right?

244
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:44,700
Yeah.

245
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:45,220
You're done.

246
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,620
Yeah.

247
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:46,960
All right.

248
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,299
So a very interesting topic.

249
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:56,179
Let us know if you have baby showers in your country or how do you celebrate a baby's birth or before it's born.

250
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,980
What do you do?

251
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,259
Very good question.

252
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:58,799
Let us know.

253
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,539
Our website is EnglishPod.com.

254
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,360
We hope to see you there.

255
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:01,759
All right.

256
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:02,000
Bye.

257
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:02,360
Bye.

258
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:05,879
Bye.

259
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:05,919
Bye.
