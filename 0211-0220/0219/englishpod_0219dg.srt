EnglishPod.com Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:13,240
I've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me.

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,519
Let's get started!

4
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,239
OK, let's start opening some presents!

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,379
Oh look!

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,620
What a great little bib for the baby!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,600
This will definitely come in handy.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,640
Oh wow, you also got me a stroller!

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,000
That's so great!

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:28,960
Thank you!

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,440
This next one is from Betty!

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,619
A hot chair and a car seat!

13
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,179
Wow, Betty, thank you so much!

14
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,579
I really appreciate it.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,619
One more from Carla!

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,619
A playpen and crib?

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,500
Thanks Carla, this is just what I needed.

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,799
OK, that's all of them.

19
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:47,939
No more gifts!

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,079
Now, who wants to guess when the baby is due?

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,159
Umm, I think my water just broke.

22
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,359
Get me to a hospital!

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,479
Thanks for watching!
