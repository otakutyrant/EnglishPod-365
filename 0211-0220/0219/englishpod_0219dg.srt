EnglishPod.com Thank you for organizing this great baby shower for me.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I've always been to baby showers but never actually had one held for me.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's get started!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
OK, let's start opening some presents!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh look!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What a great little bib for the baby!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This will definitely come in handy.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh wow, you also got me a stroller!

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's so great!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Thank you!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This next one is from Betty!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A hot chair and a car seat!

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Wow, Betty, thank you so much!

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I really appreciate it.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One more from Carla!

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
A playpen and crib?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thanks Carla, this is just what I needed.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
OK, that's all of them.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No more gifts!

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now, who wants to guess when the baby is due?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Umm, I think my water just broke.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Get me to a hospital!

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thanks for watching!
